The Guardian,"Ukraine war briefing: Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, say European ministers","If we can’t join Nato we must build our own, says Zelenskyy; Russian trial begins over explosion that crippled Kerch bridge. What we know on day 1,086   Nothing about ending Russia’s war against Ukraine should be decided without the Ukrainians, European ministers said on Wednesday. “Ukraine and Europe must be part of any negotiations,” a joint statement of seven countries and the European Commission said. John Healey, the British defence secretary, told Sky News: “It’s the Ukrainians that are doing the fighting. It’s for them to decide when to start talking and on what terms.”As ministers from France, Britain, Germany, Poland, Italy, Spain and the European Commission met with Ukraine’s foreign minister in Paris on Wednesday, the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, said a return to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders was unrealistic and the US did not see Nato membership for Kyiv as part of a solution to the war.Hegseth’s comments were followed by a call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, after which Trump said their teams had agreed to start negotiations immediately and he would meet the Russian president in Saudi Arabia. The US president underlined he was “OK” with Ukraine being barred from Nato and cared little if Russia kept the land it had invaded. When asked if any European countries would be involved in peace talks, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: “I don’t have any European nations who are involved currently to read out for you.”Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine would need the US to help it build up an army as big as that of Russia as a “Plan B” if it could not join Nato. “If Ukraine is not in Nato, it means that Ukraine will build Nato on its territory,” Zelenskyy said in an interview with the Economist published on Wednesday.Ukraine said it had detained a high-ranking official within its own security services who was allegedly working for Russia. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said that its head, Vasyl Maliuk, personally carried out the arrest and that Zelenskyy was informed of the operation, codenamed “rat”.Eight men went on trial in Russia on Wednesday charged with a “terrorist act” over the deadly explosion that tore through the illegal Kerch Bridge built by Russia from its territory to occupied Crimea in Ukraine. The truck bomb collapsed two highway sections of the bridge, fully and then partly closing it for months, and killed four people. The accused are being tried in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don at a military court with hearings held behind closed doors.Ukraine will need help from partners to import additional gas amid constant Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian gas facilities, deputy energy minister Roman Andarak said on Wednesday.The US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said on Wednesday that a critical minerals deal between Kyiv and Washington could leave Ukraine with “a security shield” once the war with Russia is over. After meeting Bessent in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said Ukraine and the US were drawing up a “new document on security, economic cooperation, and resource partnership” and he hoped to sign an agreement at the Munich security conference beginning on Friday.Britain said on Wednesday it would give Ukraine military aid worth £150m including drones, tanks and air defence systems.China is helping Russia’s military drone production by becoming a hub for the smuggling of critical western components for Moscow’s armed forces, Estonia’s foreign intelligence said in its annual national security report published on Wednesday. About 80% of such components reaching Russia now come from China, it said. Previous Ukrainian reports have suggested 60%. A spokesperson for China’s embassy in Tallinn told Reuters the “accusations” were “without any substantial evidence by an unreliable institution … China never provides weapons to the parties to the crisis and strictly controls the export of dual-use articles.”The previous Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, has accused Zelenskyy of having Ukraine’s national security and defence council adopt “unconstitutional, politically motivated” sanctions against him. Poroshenko, who heads the largest opposition bloc in Ukraine’s parliament, did not disclose terms of the sanctions. Zelenskyy, who won the 2019 poll by a landslide against Poroshenko, said in his nightly video address that the council had approved decisions that would be made public on Thursday. He made no reference to Poroshenko. Continue reading...","Thu, 13 Feb 2025 01:25:13 GMT",-0.5994,0.9156

Bear in mind, the last he played in the area, in June 2022, was at the nearby MetLife Stadium with its 82,000 capacity. But for this special engagement, just 575 people would come together to watch the music icon at the comparatively minuscule Bowery Ballroom.Naturally, tickets disappeared immediately, with stories of hopeful attenders physically running (yes, running!) down to the venue for box office-only sales.

It’s perhaps notable for Harrison Ford playing a US president for the first time since Air Force One in 1997, but now with secret health worries and liable to succumb to a terrifying rage which turns him into Red Hulk (Red State Hulk?) who is the ultimate disruptor, putting his great big red fist through the West Wing.A novelty there, maybe, though he conforms to the time-honoured Hulk tradition of somehow having miraculously stretchy trousers so that the Red Hulk genitals are not exposed. As for the apparent Maga implications, Mr Ford has himself denied them, and the MCU is as cautiously apolitical as ever, though Ford’s character is certainly keener on international cooperation than the current real-life incumbent.

He and his older brother, Óskar, ran a farm above the peninsula of Dyrhólaey, a couple of hours’ drive from Reykjavík. A raging storm had broken lots of power lines so the farm had no electricity. I’d heard the brothers were having to milk their cows by hand and thought I might be able to get a good picture for the paper.When Guðjón opened the door, he just said: “What do you want?” He wasn’t very friendly, though I sensed this was an act. He invited me in for coffee and I ended up getting the shots I wanted, but after they ran in the paper, someone complained that the cows looked dirty and they were taken away. Feeling it was my fault, I went back to the farm to apologise. Guðjón said: “I’m glad – I didn’t want to milk them anyway.” Continue reading...","Wed, 12 Feb 2025 15:28:22 GMT",0.6369,-0.4939

The court can think of few things more disingenuous.It has become ever more apparent that, to our president, the rule of law is but an impediment to his policy goals.

The Guardian,Why does Labour think bashing migrants is the way to defeat Reform? Look abroad: the tactic never works | Owen Jones,"With no clear vision for the country, the party is borrowing tactics that have palpably failed elsewhere – and made the hard right strongerA Labour government with no coherent strategy, with calamitous polling figures, suddenly has a plan. Finally, a disillusioned electorate cry: after all, two-thirds of UK voters believe Labour feels like “more of the same” compared with the previous disastrous Tory government, including nearly half of Labour voters. Perhaps the plan includes radical proposals to deal with Britain’s unprecedented cost of living crisis – not least given that the Joseph Rowntree Foundation projects real disposable incomes will fall under Labour rule? Perhaps there’s a recognition that Britain’s crumbling public realm can never be fixed without meaningful tax hikes on the thriving well-to-do?Alas, no: the plan is “kick migrants more, just harder”. Labour has decided to lift the policies and approach of Nigel Farage and Donald Trump. It will plough up to £392m into deporting undocumented migrants, enough money to train more than 10,000 new nurses. The Home Office is offering migrant-bashing porn, by publishing footage of migrants being deported, and has issued guidance all but forbidding refugees who have taken a “dangerous route” from ever getting British citizenship, in violation of the UN refugee convention.

The Guardian,"If you thought Elon Musk was bad, look at his dreadful mini-mes and shudder for America | Emma Brockes","They are young and seizing the reins of government on their master’s behalf with an imperial swagger. It will end in many tearsYou would be forgiven for thinking we were back at the Bullingdon Club, in the company of Jonty, Munty, Stiffy, Kipper, Chugger and, to use the polite version, Pig Botherer – only in this case it’s Big Balls and a guy with a history of racist tweeting. This is the sudden, startling emergence into American political life of a type deeply recognisable to Brits: that is, jaunty young men with juvenile nicknames and a firm belief they should be running the world.This being America, the class signifiers are slightly different from those in Britain. But in most regards, the cohort of young men hired by Elon Musk for his cost-cutting taskforce, the department of government efficiency (Doge), will be familiar to anyone who lived through the era of Boris Johnson’s weapons-grade flippancy or reports of David Cameron’s youthful hijinks.

The Guardian,A state clean-up may be the best bet for Thames Water | Nils Pratley,"Temporary nationalisation isn’t guaranteed to deliver shock needed, but upgrading operations is priority lost in legal dramaWill the high court allow Thames Water to load another £3bn of debt on to its already unsustainable pile of £19bn? Will the company appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority to try to bag bigger bill rises than the pre-inflation 35% permitted by the regulator? Does special administration, AKA temporary nationalisation, loom at the end of the end of next month?Answers to the first two questions should emerge in the next week. In the meantime, here comes a subplot that in other circumstances would be the main event: Ofwat will investigate whether Thames has breached its obligations by failing to deliver environmental upgrades on time.

They include not only three Conservative prime ministers, but also his immediate predecessor as Labour leader and countless others who failed to realise how ruthless Starmer can be until – for them – it was too late.

The Guardian,"At 57, I went to the British Museum for the first time – and it left me rather cold | Adrian Chiles","I found the history of the world there, told through the medium of pots. The orgy of earthenware was bafflingHaving lived in London since 1986, it was to my shame and discredit that I’d never been to the British Museum. I was not proud of the fact. This wasn’t a one-man boycott over the Parthenon marbles or anything like that. I’d just never got round to it. And this wasn’t good enough. So last week, at the ripe old age of nearly 58, I paid the British Museum a visit.“Ah, Mr Chiles,” exclaimed no one when I walked in, “about time!” But there must have been something trepidatious about me, because a nice chap asked if I needed any help. I stammered something about looking for room 41. A friend had told me room 41 was special, so it seemed as good a place as any to start. This room tells the story of Europe from AD300. Which was amazing and all that, except it was a story told mainly through the medium of pots. Urns, pots and assorted drinking vessels of all shapes and sizes. I moved from room 41 to other rooms, going backwards and forwards in time and to all points of the compass, and found yet more pots, urns and drinking vessels. Ornate pots, rustic pots, arty pots, functional pots. Continue reading...","Wed, 12 Feb 2025 16:24:03 GMT",0.0,0.9709
The Guardian,The Guardian view on spending cuts: behold the grim return of slash-and-burn government | Editorial,"Spending public money carefully is a virtue in itself, but running down the public sector can cause huge problems later onSlash-and-burn government is back in vogue. Whether it is Elon&nbsp;Musk and his engineers taking the axe to US agency spending, the Conservative leader, Kemi&nbsp;Badenoch, wishing she had her own mini-Musk, or Sir Keir Starmer complaining about the “tepid bath of managed decline”, the complaint is that bureaucracy is bloated and needs to be cut down to size. 
 We’ve heard such charges before. For some it is ideologically driven: they believe that the state is inherently inefficient and that only businesspeople know how to make money count. For others it is prompted by the expansion of government in response to crises ultimately caused by state undercapacity, not overreach. They were wheeled out in the 2010s, after rich states stepped in to save the banks and prop up the economies. Then came the Covid pandemic, in which rich states stepped in to save employees (through such measures as furlough) and support businesses.Last time, it was David Cameron’s team who styled themselves as “disruptors” and brought in the businessman Philip Green as an “efficiency guru”. This time it’s Donald Trump. Yet, measured as a proportion of all US workers, the US federal government workforce is smaller than it was just after the second world war, when Mr Trump was born. And shifting its work to costlier private-sector operations has not been a boon.
 One of the great parables of the consequences of an outsider hacking away at a complex organisation is contained in a history of Britain’s trashy cable channel, Live TV. The authors, Chris Horrie and Adam&nbsp;Nathan, give a picture of what happened when the lifelong print journalist Kelvin MacKenzie suddenly got to be boss. Not understanding many of the technicalities of television, he would apparently charge into the studio gallery while programmes were going out live and&nbsp;demand&nbsp;staff answer his questions. “Who are you? What do you do? … If you can’t tell me in&nbsp;20&nbsp;seconds … you’re out.” If the programme fell&nbsp;off&nbsp;air after they’d been given the boot, he would&nbsp;plead with them to come back. 
 Even Live TV’s viewers are unlikely to have been gravely distressed by its inadequacies. But government touches everyone’s lives, and in the most serious manner. Continue reading...","Wed, 12 Feb 2025 19:14:02 GMT",-0.7096,0.6705
The Guardian,The Guardian view on Labour and asylum: in retreat from decency | Editorial,"Dread of losing voters to Reform UK is driving the government into a familiar political trapOne of Sir Keir Starmer’s first actions on becoming prime minister was to cancel the previous government’s scheme for deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda. It was the right decision for practical and ethical reasons. The Rwanda scheme was an expensive failure that put Britain in breach of international treaty obligations and promised to prolong the trauma of refugees.Labour’s alternative policy is contained in the border security, asylum and immigration bill that passed its second reading in the Commons this week. The proposed law creates new police powers to disrupt the traffic of small boats smuggling people across the Channel. A new border security command will have powers like those deployed in counter-terrorism operations. Continue reading...","Wed, 12 Feb 2025 19:14:20 GMT",0.2023,0.5719
The Guardian,Why Labour’s stance on migrants will backfire | Letters,"The government’s populist discourse copying Reform on migration will foster racism and xenophobia, says Simon Steyne, and Gareth Jones says the party must adopt new tactics if it is to see off challenges from the rightProgressive MPs and NGOs supporting refugee and migrant rights have criticised the government’s public display of arrests and deportations of putatively undocumented migrant workers, among whom may be victims of trafficking. Enver Solomon (Lights, camera, and a new low: why is the government making Deportation TV, 10 February) and John Harris (Starmer’s dislike of real politics is plain to see. It’s why his government has no direction, 9 February) rightly suggest that this performative attempt to take the wind from Reform’s sails will not only fail but also foster racism and xenophobia.In my article in the RTE/Espol journal’s special edition on migration in 2022, I argued that Theresa&nbsp;May’s support for the Modern Slavery Act and the 2014&nbsp;protocol to the International Labour Organization’s forced labour convention (no 29) had been linked to their weaponisation by anti-migration populism.

The Guardian,Tackling child poverty in Britain must be made a priority | Letters,"Andrew Forsey highlights a simple policy change that would provide much-needed meals, while Stewart Lansley says poverty and inequality are umbilically linked. Plus a letter from Jess McQuail and Kartik Raj Heather Stewart’s excellent analysis (Labour must seize the moment to show child poverty matters in push for growth, 9 February) draws attention to those parts of the social safety net – housing, employment and benefits – that need to be strengthened by Labour’s child-poverty strategy. There are also two parts of the nutritional safety net, which, with the right reform, would put more money in poorer families’ pockets.First, the NHS’s Healthy Start scheme is worth at least £4.25 a week for families on low incomes with children under the age of four, enabling them to purchase fruit and vegetables, milk and pulses. Yet, at any one time, about one-third of eligible recipients are not registered for the scheme, leaving tens of millions of pounds worth of support unclaimed each year.

And as for my 6pm crisps fix – forget itThe scale of plastic pollution is so terrifying, I mostly try to avoid thinking about it, but some facts stop me in my tracks. According to the UN Foundation, there is already enough plastic in the oceans to fill 5m shipping containers – and if production continues at its current rate, by the middle of this century there will be more plastic in the sea than fish. It is also indestructible – all the plastic ever made is still here, decomposing into microplastics that contaminate every corner of the planet – including our bodies. And it’s not just a case of somehow finding a way to “clean it up”. “Plastic pollution is now altering some major processes at the scale of the entire Earth system,” the Stockholm Resilience Centre reported, chillingly, in November.In the UK alone, our plastic waste problem is mindblowing: in its 2024 Big Plastic Count, Everyday Plastic got almost 225,000 people to count their plastic waste for a week; the final tally was over 4.6m pieces.

The Guardian,Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy review – giant laughs for Hugh Grant but weepie sequel is strangely dazed,"Renée Zellweger looks as if she’s thinking of something else in weird fourquel that sees our heroine choosing between new suitors Leo Woodall and Chiwetel EjioforThe last Bridget Jones film – the second sequel, about Bridget having a baby – executed the daring athletic leap of jumping the shark and then jumping back. There were some tired novelties but, by virtue of its conscientiously maintained stream of likable gags, it leapt back into our hearts and BJ3 seemed a decent way to sign off the franchise and remember Helen Fielding’s inspired creation. But though I was willing myself to enjoy this fourth film, about the heroine’s adventure with a younger man, the Bridget Jones series has frankly run out of steam.This is a fourquel in the same unhappy tradition as Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. The jokes have been dialled down to accommodate a contrived and unconvincingly mature “weepie” component but the film becomes sad in the wrong way. The actors are mostly going through the motions, there is so little chemistry between each of the two lead pairings they resemble a panda being forced to mate with a flamingo, and Renée Zellweger’s performance is starting to look eccentric.

The Guardian,More Life review – death-cheating tech drama is incredibly human,"Royal Court theatre, LondonA wonderfully precise ensemble cast make this sci-fi vision of resurrection and immortality stab directly at the heartWhat makes a life? Kandinsky theatre company’s bruising sci-fi drama sweeps us thrillingly from 1803, when scientists electrocute a corpse to simulate stuttering new life, to 2074, when private tech companies experiment with downloading brain scans of the dead to infallible new bodies. A smartly composed exploration of greed, loss and the loneliness of eternity, More Life is an incredibly human play about technology.Victor (Marc Elliott) is our futuristic Frankenstein, a bulldozing consultant obsessed with progress, preservation and a dead woman he hopes will be the first success in his company’s experiments. As Vic brings Bridget (Alison Halstead) to a kind of life, the wonderfully precise ensemble watches as she tries on her new body. Under James Yeatman’s delicate direction, the voice is dislocated, alienating the physical form. Halstead is wonderful here, estranged from her own body, limbs suddenly stiff and unknown.

The Guardian,Goya to Impressionism review – three salmon steaks blow the soppy jugs and flowers away,"Courtauld Gallery, LondonIs there an ulterior motive to this drearily grand exhibition of paintings borrowed from a Swiss collection? Could it be to show how vastly superior the Courtauld’s own works are?The bland title of this show reads a bit like a confession, in terms of how little it has to say. Goya to Impressionism – so? Why do we need to see the troubled Spanish painter of war and witchcraft juxtaposed with soft scenes by Renoir and Sisley? No reason, except they all belong to a collection whose home in Winterthur, Switzerland, is closed for renovation, meaning the Courtauld can borrow them as a job lot. The trouble is that the Oskar Reinhart Collection is too similar to the Courtauld’s own to be an overly exciting proposition.Both hoards were gathered in the early-20th century by wealthy private collectors with a penchant for French art of the late 1800s, yet by and large Samuel Courtauld got the best stuff. Reinhart’s Manets are minor compared with the dazzling masterpieces owned by the Courtauld. This is also true of Renoir. The Courtauld owns La Loge, Renoir’s scintillating early painting of modern love, but Reinhart’s row of soppy, second-rate Renoirs live down to every stereotype of this big impressionist softy.

The Guardian,How Harrison Ford brought a strike over video game AI to the world’s attention,"Voice actors demanding compensation when AI generates performances from their work have taken industrial action since JulyWhen Harrison Ford spoke to the Wall Street Journal last week, praising the performance of voice actor Troy Baker in the recent video game Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, he was doing much more than recognising a great impression of himself. “You don’t need artificial intelligence to steal my soul,” he told the paper. “You can already do it for nickels and dimes with good ideas and talent. [Baker] did a brilliant job, and it didn’t take AI to do it.”Video game performers in the SAG-AFTRA union have been on strike since July, the major issue being the use of generative AI in the games industry. The union wants members to be compensated when AI performances are generated from their work, and demands consent and transparency around Gen AI technology. Major video game publishers such as Activision Blizzard, Disney, Warner Bros and Electronic Arts are involved in the dispute, and several recent titles including Destiny 2: Heresy and Genshin Impact have been affected, with English-language voice performances missing. AI voice synthesis is being touted as a means of cutting costs in an industry where game budgets are spiralling, but such technologies imperil actors’ livelihoods while relying on their work to seed virtual performances. Plus, the budgetary benefits of the tech are still in question. Continue reading...","Wed, 12 Feb 2025 12:03:34 GMT",-0.128,0.91
The Guardian,Top of the flops: just what does the games industry deem ‘success’ any more?,"Dragon Age: The Veilguard has reached 1.5 million gamers around the world – yet its developers have labelled it a disappointment. With unfair expectations, it’s the niche and left-field titles that will sufferBack in 2013, having bought the series from Eidos, Square Enix released a reboot of the hit 1990s action game Tomb Raider starring a significantly less objectified Lara Croft. I loved that game, despite a quasi-assault scene near the beginning that I would later come to view as a bit icky, and I wasn’t the only one – it was extremely well received, selling 3.4m copies in its first month alone. Then Square Enix came out and called it a disappointment.Sales did not meet the publisher’s expectations, apparently, which raises the question: what were the expectations? Was it supposed to sell 5m in one month? If a book sells 10,000 copies in a week it’s considered a bestseller. Even at the height of its popularity in the 90s, no Tomb Raider game ever sold more than a few million. Square Enix’s expectations were clearly unrealistic. It wouldn’t be the last time; in a 2016 interview with Hajime Tabata, Final Fantasy XV’s director, he told me that game needed to sell 10m to succeed.

The Guardian,"Less bias, better hires: why AI could transform recruitment for SMEs","No system, human or digital, is perfect. But by using artificial intelligence to do a lot of the legwork, SMEs can limit the effects of unconscious bias and free up their people to find the ideal candidate for the jobArtificial intelligence is trained on real intelligence – in other words, content created by humans. Theoretically, if you want AI to spit out fiction, you train it on novels and if you want AI to write job specs, you train it on job descriptions written by people. But there’s a problem here. No matter how hard humans try to be unbiased, we all have some. And an AI that has been trained on human work will take on some of these human biases. Indeed, overcoming biases is one of the biggest challenges in AI.“In recruitment, bias is everywhere and comes from a baseline of most recruitment processes being run by humans,” says Kevin Fitzgerald, UK managing director of Employment Hero, a global employment management platform that is using AI to make doing business easier for SMEs. “The underlying bias that recruitment teams have is there in the process already.” Continue reading...","Thu, 19 Dec 2024 09:40:03 GMT",0.3642,0.985

Fifty-two per cent of respondents said that adopting the company’s platform made their organisation more efficient, 42% said it made them faster and 65% said they were using less paper.

No one wants hoop earrings that tarnish on their first wear or flimsy chains that break easily.

After all, just how different can a tin of beans be? To my surprise, I discovered very striking disparities between the ones I tested, so if you’re someone who routinely decants excess juice or reduces the sauce to achieve that authentic school dinner effect, you might be better off simply switching allegiance. Similarly, the sugar content varied between 9% of your recommended daily allowance to 13%, so if that’s a concern, look out for reduced- or no-sugar brands instead.There’s a significant price difference between supermarket own labels and the leading brands, too. If you’re after a gourmet experience, I’d recommend the Bold Bean Co’s rich tomato baked beans (£3.50), because they remind me of those homemade beans you sometimes get with a fry-up at fancy cafes: intensely savoury and packed full of herbs. They don’t qualify here, because they are to ordinary baked beans what rye sourdough is to white sliced, but they’re bloody lovely all the same. That said, you can’t go wrong with any of our best buys served on buttered toast with a light dusting of grated cheddar. Small pleasures don’t come much cheaper.

The Guardian,How to make the perfect cannelés – recipe | Felicity Cloake's How to make the perfect …,"A relatively new addition to French patisserie, these soft-centred batter pastries can be the devil to perfect – luckily, we have our own perfectionist … With great age comes the confidence to keep things simple, and to see the merits of, say, a margherita pizza over a five cheese and ’nduja, the quiet pleasure of dal and rice, or the discreet charms of an old-school jam doughnut or a digestive biscuit. The canelé de Bordeaux is a prime example of such understated genius. An inexperienced eye might well miss these squat little Doric columns amid the glitz and glaze of a French patisserie, but as my friend Nicola Lamb puts it, discovering them “is like being in a secret club, a club that all shares a valuable piece of knowledge: the canelé is the pastry GOAT”. That unassuming mahogany shell should shatter into caramelised shards to reveal a rich, almost custardy vanilla- and rum-scented interior.Not that many people who’ve tried making cannelés at home would call them simple; rarely have I sifted through so much agonised discussion and mournful photos of failed attempts that have mushroomed out of their moulds or failed to brown on top. Many thousands of words have been devoted to the correct way to season bespoke hand-tooled copper cannelé moulds with beeswax, the precise temperature of the milk, the optimum time to age the mixture, all creating almost as much mystique around what is basically a batter pudding as there is around its origins. For all the talk of 17th-century nuns with a glut of egg yolks from the local winemaking industry, the first mention of cannelés dates from 1937. In fact, they did not become widely available even in Bordeaux, where they are now omnipresent, until the establishment in 1985 of the Confrérie de Canelé, the organisation that dictated that authentic Bordeaux cannelés should be distinguished by being spelled with just the one n. Henceforth, therefore, I will revert to the original spelling of cannelé out of respect for the Brotherhood, and because such a simple recipe cannot possibly be in the least authentic, however delicious the results.

The Guardian,The seven-year wait for a dentist: why Linda Colla pulled out her own teeth,"In chronic pain, unable to find an NHS practice and priced out of private care, Colla – like millions of Britons – felt she had no choice but to take matters into her own handsLinda Colla holds an imaginary tooth between her forefinger and thumb and pulls it. Then she adds some rotation. Extracting her own teeth required wiggling and twisting, she explains. “It took me a couple of weeks to get each one out, because they just loosened and loosened and loosened. I used a tissue to get a better grip.”We meet in her bungalow near Ottery St Mary in Devon, which she shares with her labrador, Cleo, and her jack russell, Josie. Before our meeting, she told me over the phone that she had kept the yanked teeth. I ask to see them. She&nbsp;disappears and returns with a small box. “They’re a bit grim‑looking now, because they’ve&nbsp;been out for&nbsp;a&nbsp;while.” Continue reading...","Wed, 12 Feb 2025 05:00:17 GMT",0.0,0.7845
The Guardian,A moment that changed me: I arrived in London as a child refugee — and discovered a strange new world,"The city sometimes felt achingly lonely. But after seeing my first escalator, trying salt and vinegar crisps and watching an East 17 video on repeat, I began to find my wayA few days after Christmas 1994, aged 10, I arrived in London as a refugee from Somalia. At Heathrow airport, I stood staring in awe at the escalators. I had heard about these “walking machines” from an elderly Somali woman in Addis Ababa who sat on a corner selling sweets, biscuits and cold Fanta in glass bottles. She had painted a picture of London, a city she had never been to, as a place of wonders.“You won’t need to use your legs to walk there – they have machines that move for you,” she said. My eyes bulged with excitement. I had never seen such machines on the streets of Addis Ababa. In my area, Bole Mikael, there were no pavements, just puddles of dirty water.

The Guardian,What really happened in Calvine? The mystery behind the best UFO picture ever seen,"In August 1990, two hikers sent photos of a strange diamond-shaped aircraft to the press – but the story never appeared. Was it a prank, a hoax, an optical illusion or something else entirely?On a misty evening in August 1990, two men hiking on the moors surrounding Calvine, a pretty hamlet in Perth and Kinross, claimed to have seen a giant diamond-shaped aircraft flying above them. It apparently had no clear means of propulsion and left no smoke plume; it was silent and static, as if frozen in time. Terrified, they hit the ground and scrambled for cover behind a tree. Then a Harrier fighter jet roared into view, circling the diamond as if sizing it up for a scuffle. One of the men snapped a series of photographs just before the bizarre craft shot away vertically and disappeared.Craig Lindsay was a press officer at the RAF base in Pitreavie Castle in Dunfermline, 50 miles away, when the Daily Record got in touch a few days later. The hikers, who worked as chefs at Fisher’s Hotel in Pitlochry, had sent six photos of the diamond to the newspaper and told their story. The Record’s picture editor, Andy Allen, sent Lindsay the&nbsp;best of the bunch. Continue reading...","Tue, 11 Feb 2025 05:00:08 GMT",0.6369,-0.6884

The Guardian,Why giving up the Chagos Islands could cost Britain £9bn – podcast,"Eleni Courea discusses the UK’s historic deal to sign sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, and why some inside the Labour party are now regretting it. Campaigner Olivier Bancoult outlines why he hopes the deal will go aheadIn October last year, the UK and Mauritian governments reached a historic agreement to transfer the sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, a series of atolls in the Indian Ocean that have been described as Britain’s last African colony.It seemed, as political correspondent Eleni Courea describes, a diplomatic triumph for the new Labour government, ending decades of legal dispute over the ownership of the islands. And more than that, it offered Chagossians, after more than 50 years of exile, the prospect of returning home. In the late 1960s, when Britain granted independence to the rest of Mauritius, not only did it insist on carving out the Chagos Islands to keep for itself, but it forcibly displaced more than 1,000 people who lived there.

For Samy Arbid, who had moved into a property just a block from the fire line in November, there was a different kind of challenge: a 525lb (240kg) black bear. It had moved into the crawl space under the house before the fire and was still sheltering there when Arbid and his wife returned. The California wildfire department stepped in to help, luring the bear out with treats after deciding it was too big to tranquillise.
