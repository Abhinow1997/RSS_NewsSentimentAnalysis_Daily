The Guardian,"Ukraine war briefing: North Korean troops yet to make major impact on fighting, says Ukraine military intelligence","Missile strike targets residential building in Kryvyi Rih; Christmas celebrations across Ukraine shrouded in grief. What we know on day 1,036See all our Ukraine war coverageA ballistic missile struck an apartment building in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih on Tuesday, killing one person and injuring 15, four of them seriously, officials said. Ukrainian officials denounced the Christmas Eve attack on the city, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s home town. 
 “While other countries of the world are celebrating Christmas, Ukrainians are continuing to suffer from endless Russian attacks,” Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, wrote on Telegram.Nearly three years into the Russian invasion, Christmas celebrations across Ukraine are shrouded in grief. “Not all of us are home, unfortunately. Sadly, not everyone has a home. And tragically, not everyone is still with us,” Zelenskyy said in an address. This will be the first Christmas that Lyubov spends without her son Taras Onyskiv, who died aged 32 in May while fighting off Russian troops on the eastern front. She brought a Christmas tree to her son’s grave in the Lychakiv cemetery in south-eastern Lviv, covered in a dusting of fresh snow. “We’ll come and spend Christmas here,” she said, after wrapping fairy lights over the tombstone. Mariya Lun lost her son Yuri in 2022. “We will bring Christmas porridge here on Christmas Eve,” Lun said. “We will pray that it will be easy for him in heaven without us.” Zelenskyy signed a law in July 2023 to move the official Christmas Day holiday to 25 December, departing from the Russian Orthodox Church tradition of celebrating on 7 January.The presence of North Korean soldiers alongside Russian troops in the Russian region of Kursk has not yet had a major impact on the course of the fighting, a Ukrainian military intelligence official has said. “The involvement of the North Koreans in the fighting has not had a significant impact on the situation. It is not such a significant number of personnel,” Yevgen Yerin, spokesperson for the Ukrainian military intelligence service (GUR), told AFP. “But they are also learning. And we cannot underestimate the enemy. And we can see that they are already taking some things into account in their activities,” he added.A Russian court has sentenced a man to 22 years in prison for two acts of sabotage on railway lines in Crimea last year. The court said Pavel Levchenko was recruited and trained by Ukraine’s SBU security service and sent to the annexed Crimea to carry out “acts of terrorism”. The court said Levchenko had carried out two explosions on railway lines while cargo trains were passing and had planned more acts of sabotage. Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014.Ukraine said Russia attacked it with 60 drones, of which 36 were downed, 23 were jammed by electronic warfare and one was still in the air. The Ukrainian air force said drones had been shot down in eight regions across the country in a statement posted on the Telegram app on Tuesday.

The Guardian,A Ghost Story for Christmas: Woman of Stone review – this E Nesbit tale definitely ain’t The Railway Children,"Mark Gatiss’s seventh festive horror tale is an adaptation of a short story by the children’s author – with added sisterhood and righteous vengeanceI have never understood the association of ghost stories with Christmas. Is it because it is still a part-pagan festival? Is it because we don’t like to let ourselves be too happy? Or is it because the whole family is likely to be home and you need to remind yourself that there could be more malevolent forces out there than in here, whatever the toxic dynamics? Perhaps it’s just because it gets dark so early.Whatever the reason, here is another half-hour shiver from Mark Gatiss, adapted this time not from the output of his beloved MR James, but from a more unexpected source. A Ghost Story for Christmas: Woman of Stone is based on a short story called Man-size in Marble by E Nesbit. Yes, that E Nesbit! The Railway Children E Nesbit! She was a prolific writer of novels and short stories, for adults as well as children; Man-size in Marble was published as part of her Grim Tales collection (for grownups) in 1893.

The Guardian,"‘This book is my bible!’ The women who read Miranda July’s All Fours, then blew up their lives","The wildly acclaimed novel about a perimenopausal woman going on a journey of erotic awakening has left a wave of women following in the protagonist’s wake‘I don’t read books that literally,” says Abra, 49, from Arizona. “I&nbsp;don’t read literature as self-help.” But we’re talking about All Fours, the second novel by the American artist and author Miranda July, which came out this year, and the way it changed her life. The New York Times called it “the first great perimenopause novel” and “the talk of every group text”, having started “a whisper network of women fantasising about desire and freedom”. This is a novel that made women blow up their lives; every book group had a friend of a friend whose life had been shaken to its foundations.If you’ve not read the book, the plot can be summarised thus: an artist – wife to a Good Guy, mother to an under-10 – sets off on a road trip and gets distracted by a dancer. She moves into a motel room to stay near him, and remodels it in sumptuous fabrics. She can’t sleep, can’t think, definitely can’t go home, maddened with longing. The libidinous intensity of what’s later floated as a perimenopause effect is magical. I’d never seen that on a page before. Continue reading...","Tue, 24 Dec 2024 08:00:39 GMT",0.0,0.9835

I deferred, which was annoying, because I was completely right; everything that’s wrong with that film was visible from space.And yet, give it its due, it caught the spirit of the age. It has nauseating class politics: the central love affair, between Hugh Grant’s prime minister and Martine McCutcheon’s tea lady, is a fairytale precisely because its emotional centre is lottery-winner gratitude, that a prince might fall for a peasant.

Now those pieces are still published, but they seem fewer and farther between, and take a different tone. Instead of focusing on why it’s OK to cut off your Trump-voting family members (although a few do still take that tack), they largely emphasize how to get along, find common values and enjoy the holidays without politics.

Unfortunately, everyone knows the lyricsThe British Broadcasting Corporation’s Somali service theme tune is one of the most popular and recognisable sounds for people in Somalia and the diaspora. With a whistling rhythm and melody, it is authoritative and catchy. The words that follow the music haven’t changed for more than 60 years: “Halkaniwaa BBC – this is the BBC.”Hiding in plain acoustics, however, is the fact that the lyrics originally written – although not used – for the music are deeply anti-colonial, and deliberately designed to be remembered by Somalis every time they listen to the British radio station’s instrumental. In essence, the theme is an anti-colonial free ad on the coloniser’s airwaves, a fervent proclamation and calling to attention for the public.Dadkaan dhawaaqayaa,Dhulkooda doonayaa, Continue reading...","Tue, 24 Dec 2024 15:00:44 GMT",0.0,0.9117

The Guardian,Will Trump’s tariff threats protect the dollar’s dominance?,"Brics nations’ plan to create rival to greenback is bound to fail even without president-elect’s measuresIn 2023, the leaders of Brazil and the other Brics countries at the time – China, India, Russia, and South Africa – discussed collaboration on a new shared currency. The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has been a vocal proponent of an alternative to the US dollar, the dominant global currency for the past 75 years, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, publicly promoted the idea during the Brics summit in October by brandishing a symbolic Brics banknote. The bloc’s new members – Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates – would presumably also be included in the new joint currency.The proposed challenge to the dollar has already drawn the ire of the US president-elect, Donald Trump, who has threatened to impose punitive tariffs of 100% on countries that move away from the greenback. At the end of last month, Trump warned Brics countries against creating or supporting an alternative reserve currency. “We require a commitment from these countries that they will neither create a new Brics currency nor back any other currency to replace the mighty US dollar, or they will face 100% tariffs,” he declared on Truth Social, his social media platform.

The Guardian,I grew up Muslim in a Catholic community – and Mary represented common ground | Zeyneb Sayılgan,"Despite some theological differences, both denominations look to her as an inspiration for cultivating compassion and hopeI had just finished teaching a class on “the Muslim Mary”. Many non-Muslims who attended were puzzled to find out that Muslims had a connection with Mary at all, and had no knowledge of how important she is to our belief and practice. This came as no surprise. Half of Americans report they know “not much” or “nothing at all” about Islam.As a Muslim girl growing up in the overwhelmingly Catholic state of Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany, Mary was a constant presence in my life. Her images and statues, dotted across my city, smiled at me as I walked to school. At Christmas time, I joined with my classmates to sing songs such as Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht.Zeyneb Sayılgan is the Muslim Scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian and Jewish Studies in BaltimoreDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on homelessness: a health crisis as well as a housing one | Editorial,"The numbers trapped in temporary accommodation and sleeping rough have risen again. More homes for social rent are desperately neededShocking homelessness figures, showing that primary‑school children are the worst-affected age group in England, are a reminder of how gravely Conservative housing policies failed – and how desperately change is needed. In London, which has the highest homelessness rate, one in 24 pupils are in temporary accommodation – at least one in every classroom and more in poorer boroughs.Rough sleeping has also risen, bringing increased risks during cold winter nights. The recent increase in funding for councils, to help them fulfil their homelessness prevention duties, was welcomed by campaigners. But with charity budgets squeezed harder than ever, and with a national insurance rise for employers on the way, there is a real danger that housing problems for the most vulnerable members of society could get worse rather than better.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on the tenacity of hope: a necessary virtue in troubled times | Editorial,"At a moment of the year associated with renewal and new birth, reflection on inspiring acts of solidarity and courage can point the way to a better futureIn the introduction to a new, seasonal compilation of his speeches on hope, Pope Francis reflects on the legacy of the great German theologian Johann Baptist Metz. Shaped by the early experience of living through the horrors of the Nazi era, Metz’s political theology was a passionate warning against the danger of a self-absorbed Christian piety. Instead he urged a hopeful “mysticism with open eyes” – one that clear-sightedly bears witness to, and seeks to alleviate, the suffering of others.At a time of the year associated with renewal and new birth, it is not necessary to share Metz’s religious convictions to feel the power of that message. This year&nbsp;has been filled with heart-rending images from the&nbsp;ongoing wars in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and elsewhere. The weekend brought reports of yet more innocent casualties of Israel’s relentless bombing campaign, including children sheltering in a school. Meanwhile, more than 12,000 civilians have been killed&nbsp;since the start of Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine, along with more than 43,000 soldiers, according to Kyiv’s estimates.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Devolution will only work if Westminster can let go of power | Letters,"Roger Read, Tom Wilson, John Harris and Barrie Baldelli on Labour’s plans to reform local governmentMartin Kettle agrees with the government favouring “English counties, not regions, as an essential building block of a modern network” (We now have a plan to make England’s local government work – but I fear party politics will trash it, 19 December). There is a key word and concept that should form the basis of good governance. It is “subsidiarity”, meaning that decisions should be taken at the level to which they apply. It forms the basis for good governance across Europe, which is based on regions.This is because there are key functions and decisions that can only be taken effectively and in an integrated way across regions. They include the strategic planning of major developments, transportation systems, infrastructure networks, housing market areas, higher-end retail catchments, health provision and higher education, as well as environmental entities such as river valleys and water-catchment areas. So please do not advocate sentiment as a basis for second-tier governance.

Dams and dikes are erected around the lake’s edges to protect against flooding. But this year, not for the first time, they were overwhelmed.For three days in early July, more than 800 rescue workers in Hunan province scrambled to block the breaches. One rupture alone took 100,000 cubic metres of rock to seal, according to Zhang Yingchun, a Hunan official. At least 7,000 people had to be evacuated. It was one of a series of disasters to hit China as the country grappled with a summer of extreme weather.

The Guardian,"The best spooky stories for Christmas, from Victorian classics to contemporary creepy tales","People have long believed in the supernatural power of the winter solstice so, as one year ends and another begins, these ghost stories are sure to keep you upThis is a time for ghost stories. There’s a reason Shakespeare tells us: “A sad tale’s best for winter: I have one of sprites and goblins.” And why Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, and its (superior?) muppets version have retained popularity.Since pagan times, people have believed in the supernatural potential of the winter solstice. It’s a liminal moment, when the darkness retreats and the light returns, a hinge point where the door between the living and the dead can swing open. (Other liminal moments are considered supernaturally powerful, too. Midnight, for instance. And its opposite – The Apparition of Mrs Veal, sometimes described as the first modern ghost story, has its spirit appear at noon.) Continue reading...","Tue, 24 Dec 2024 11:00:41 GMT",0.6369,-0.1779

(And anyway, given that we’re talking about inheritance, shouldn’t it be “after grandma dies” not “before”?)Television director Pat Boonnitipat makes his feature film debut and 78-year-old Usha Seamkhum, a former TV commercials model making her film acting debut, gives a lovely performance as Menju, a widow who has accepted her terminal cancer with unsentimental calm.

Here are Guardian readers’ best shows of the year(Netflix) My favourite show of 2024. It seems to be a rarity in TV that a singular vision survives the creation by committee process. But in Ripley, Steven Zaillian gives us stylish black-and-white cinematography that’s usually reserved for the artiest of arthouse cinema. We get a meticulous mise-en-scene that makes every crime scene a puzzle for the viewer to dissect. And, most importantly, we get incredible central performances from Andrew Scott, Dakota Fanning and Johnny Flynn. This truly felt like a labour of love and for me surpasses both the source material and the previous film adaptation. For those eight hours, I was utterly transfixed. It also helps that for the first two episodes I didn’t realise I had subtitles turned off, so thought it was an intentional decision to avoid translating the Italian. It’s a testament to the quality of the show that I didn’t question that, and went with it. Harry Schofield, 30, London  Continue reading...","Tue, 24 Dec 2024 09:00:41 GMT",0.2023,0.9407

It is the second time that director Andrew Haigh has received this accolade – 45 Years, his searing study of a marriage plunged into crisis, was the Guardian’s choice as best film for 2015.On the face of it, the two films are sharply contrasting expressions of Haigh’s craft. 45 Years is resolutely realist in its portrait of a retired couple living in Norfolk, investing its middle-class milieu with an understated arthouse aesthetic. All of Us Strangers, meanwhile, returns to the gay themes that marked Haigh’s breakthrough Weekend, but in a shift from his past work operates in an unstable, dreamlike atmosphere that ultimately calls into question whether anything we are watching is supposed to be real.

First, be practical: “Most people have a single oven, so you don’t want five dishes that need to go in there,” says Phil King, executive chef of Pophams in London. “When I’m thinking of a menu, I want one dish that cooks in the oven, one on the stove and one that can be served at an ambient temperature, such as braised leeks.” Otherwise, favour things that like a rest, whether that’s a joint of meat (“cover with foil and a tea towel and leave for an hour”) or a veggie wellington (“that will sit comfortably for 30 minutes”). And remember, snacks are golden: “That’s anything you don’t have to prepare yourself,” notes King, be it olives, crisps, nuts – anything that will keep hunger at bay.Menu decided, do as much as you can in advance and clean up as you go. “Worktop space is at a premium, so the moment you take a pan off the stove, get it washed,” King says. “That way, you’ll have a much calmer environment.”Got a culinary dilemma?

Christmas was set to be a nice reprieve from the misery, spending a week with my family and eagerly awaiting the promise of a new year. I felt tentatively hopeful.Ten days before the holiday, my throat began to hurt. “Tonsilitis!” the doctor said, giving me a prescription for antibiotics. The pain didn’t abate, even after a week, so I dutifully went back for another dose. The pain got worse. On Christmas Eve, with no GP surgeries open, my mum drove me to the local walk-in clinic. A doctor took one look in my mouth and said I had a quinsy (don’t Google this, for the love of God, but it’s basically a throat abscess) and&nbsp;told me to get to the nearest A&amp;E as soon as possible.
