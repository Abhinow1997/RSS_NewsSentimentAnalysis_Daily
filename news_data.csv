The Guardian,Environment secretary lambasts HS2’s £100m bat shelter,"Steve Reed says plans for 1km curved structure to protect bats from high-speed railway are ‘batshit crazy’A bat shelter costing more than £100m near HS2 has been described by the environment secretary as “batshit crazy”.
 HS2 Ltd is spending the sum on the protection structure in Buckinghamshire, it emerged last year. All bats are legally protected in the UK.
 The curved structure, which has been described by the HS2 Ltd chair, Sir Jon Thompson, as a “shed”, will run for about 1km alongside Sheephouse Wood to create a barrier allowing the creatures to cross above the high-speed railway without being affected by passing trains.
 But Steve Reed has criticised the plans and told the Fabian Society’s new year conference: “I mean, (to spend) that vast amount of money on a tunnel for bats when there were so many other public services crying out for funding – it’s batshit crazy.
 “And it happened because the previous government didn’t have a grip on the public finances, didn’t have a grip on infrastructure projects, and didn’t really have a grip on what was happening to nature either.”
 Asked about the potential for tension between prioritising wildlife and the environment and pushing through planning projects, as the government has promised to do to boost economic growth, Reed said both could be achieved.
 “It’s not either or, it’s not growth or nature or the environment. We can do the two together,” he said.
 Reed also suggested any plans to build a third runway at Heathrow airport would be subject to a “proper consultation” to ensure “mitigations” were in place to make it work.
 Asked about the prospect of expanding the airport, which reports suggest the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will back, the MP for Streatham and Croydon North in London said: “Of course, it’s speculation that you’re talking about … but if there were any proposal like that, then there would be a proper consultation, hopefully not lasting decades as it has done previously, because you don’t have to take that amount of time to get to good decisions.
 “But it would take into account all of those factors, mitigations, what we will need to do to make sure that it could work.
 “Since you mentioned my voting record on that one, I voted against expanding Heathrow last time because I was in favour of expanding Gatwick because it would provide economic growth that would benefit south London, where my constituency is. So I see the link.” Continue reading...","Sat, 25 Jan 2025 21:13:19 GMT",0.0,0.985

Her arms were tied behind her back and blood pooled in the seat of her pajamas. Onlookers cheered at her distress.For months, the women of Levy’s all-female surveillance unit – tatzpitaniyot – had noticed unusual practice raids and drills taking place on the other side of the fence, but their reports and warnings were ignored by commanders.

The Guardian,‘It’s been tough’: Holly Willoughby reflects on rape and murder plot ordeal,"TV presenter says she decided to ‘positively move forward’ after conviction of man who planned to kidnap and kill herHolly Willoughby has spoken for the first time about her ordeal in which a former security guard was sentenced to life for masterminding a plot to kidnap, rape and murder her.
 Gavin Plumb, 37, was found guilty last July of soliciting murder, encouraging or assisting the commission of kidnap, and encouraging or assisting the commission of rape.Talking to the Times newspaper (paywall), the 43-year-old said of the past year: “It’s been a tough one. There’s no way of sugar-coating it.”
 Willoughby stepped down from her role as presenter of ITV’s This Morning programme six days after Plumb was arrested in 2023. She had presented the show for 14 years.
 She said: “Nothing can prepare you for something like that. When something like that happens, you have a decision to make. You either decide, right, I can take this on board and it can absolutely affect all aspects of my life.
 “Or I can make a choice to go, let’s focus on everything that’s positive and good, all those important things.
 “I’m healthy and I’m happy. I’ve got a wonderful husband and children and family, I’ve got great friends.
 “You have to go: I choose to positively move forward and rely on all those people – the police, the court, the judge, the jury – all those people to do their role. And that’s what I had to do.”
 Willoughby is making a return to television with Celebrity Bear Hunt, a Netflix show she has made with the adventurer Bear Grylls.
 When asked if there was a point that the ordeal may have consumed her, she said: “No. It wasn’t an option. For me, it’s just not an option. For all those reasons I’ve said.“That all means too much to me, to let, you know, that be the other road I could have gone down. And look, so many people go through tough things – they just do.”
 She added: “I mean, every single person I speak to, and it seems more and more currently, are going through something, you know? Continue reading...","Sat, 25 Jan 2025 20:09:34 GMT",-0.886,0.9432

The Guardian,Diamonds lose their sparkle as prices come crashing down,"Lab-grown rocks and fewer weddings have put a huge dampener on the market. On the bright side, a big dazzler is now affordable for manyDiamonds are woven through the tapestry of human history. The ancient Greeks were enthralled by their remarkable hardness. The Koh-i-Noor alone has been at the centre of invasions, murder, superstition and larceny. Millions of marriages have been launched using diamonds as the symbol of their everlasting lustre.So the idea that diamonds might somehow lose their value seems unnatural. And yet prices are falling fast and show no signs of stopping. Natural diamonds cost 26% less in shops than two years ago, a drop during a time of high inflation that would be extraordinary were it not dwarfed by the poor fortune of their identical twins, lab-grown diamonds, which are now 74% cheaper than in 2020.

Now those returns are beginning to cool.But as markets have reduced to a simmer, oil executives have warned that profits are also going off the boil.

The Guardian,"‘Our job is to be truthful not neutral’: Christiane Amanpour on Trump, tech and and fighting for the truth","Christiane Amanpour has spent four decades as a celebrated journalist and war reporter. With disinformation rampaging through the media, she talks about the threat of technocracy, Donald Trump’s second term – and why facts are more important than everJust occasionally, in more than 40 years of reporting the world’s troubles, Christiane Amanpour has forced herself to step away and pause for breath. One of those moments for rebooting came over Christmas and new year, when she took a holiday in South Africa. I met her on the day she got back to work at the CNN offices in London, from which she makes her nightly news programme, and Saturday’s The Amanpour Hour. There is a powerful sense of her team buckling up for the tumultuous year ahead. “What I cover is the international reverberations of what America does in the world and what might be coming back at America,” she says. “The good, the bad and the ugly.”Amanpour’s choice of holiday destination was, inevitably, not unrelated to the immediate challenges of that role as kickstarted by the second inauguration of President Trump this week in Washington DC. Before that she wanted to holiday somewhere, she suggests, that represented a robust spirit of hope. She had always regretted missing out on perhaps the greatest good news story of our lives: the release of Nelson Mandela from 27 years in prison and his subsequent rise to power. “I was covering all the really bad stories, the Rwanda genocide, the Bosnia war,” she says. “And I’ve always felt a little sad I missed that, because I do strongly believe that good things happen in this world. I don’t ever want to only focus on the bad. South Africa is obviously still a huge work in progress, but it was just phenomenal to see it, even as a holiday.” Continue reading...","Sun, 26 Jan 2025 00:05:34 GMT",0.4215,0.4075

Here, he talks about radio, tattoos – and the event that changed his lifeI apologise if you hear any buzzing,” says Roman Kemp, the 31-year-old radio and television presenter, leaning back in his chair. I’ve done interviews in some strange scenarios, including a sauna (twice), but this is a new one. Kemp, who is in Northern Ireland filming the BBC One quizshow The Finish Line, is video-calling me on his day off from the tattoo parlour. As he holds the phone to his face, an artist is at work inking a portrait of Thierry Henry on to his shin. “On my right leg I want to try to build as many of my favourite footballers of all time,” Kemp explains. “So I started out with original Ronaldo and we’re currently doing Thierry, and then we’ll add from there. So it’s a work in progress but yes, as I’ll show you… Very much happening.”Kemp spins the camera, just in time to catch the needle tracing his skin. Isn’t that quite painful? “Once you go past a certain amount of tattoos, you earn the right to use numbing cream,” he replies. “When I first started having them, especially some of the bigger ones, a lot of parlours want you to have the full experience. And I just suffered for many hours, and hated it. I’m too much of a wuss to do it any more to myself. I refuse to sit here in pain.” Continue reading...","Sun, 26 Jan 2025 00:05:34 GMT",-0.4767,-0.653

The Guardian,Mr Nobody Against Putin review – a teacher fights back in a powerful documentary,"Sundance film festival: A primary school teacher in Russia pushes back on cruel nationalist propaganda in a fascinating and daring look at everyday encroachmentPavel Talankin is, by his own admission early in the extraordinary documentary Mr Nobody Against Putin, not the person you or he would pick to be the hero of the story or to take on an oppressive regime. To stand up to Vladimir Putin takes a considerable amount of courage and a not inconsiderable amount of resources; Pasha, as he is known to his students, is a teacher at a small primary school in Karabash, a mining town in the Ural mountains remarkable only for its renowned levels of toxic waste, and would have been more or less content to remain the titular nobody far from Moscow. He loves his hometown, its smokestacks and Soviet buildings, but most of all loves the curiosity and enthusiasm of his students, all filmed by Talankin in his capacity as school videographer.But Talankin has always cut a bit of a non-conformist streak – he is the one teacher with a Russian democracy flag in his classroom, a safe haven for the school’s punks and artsy weirdos, or anyone with a desire to speak freely. He is openly alarmed, to the extent one can be, when the school begins enacting Vladimir Putin’s new “patriotic education policy” following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He keeps doing his job, filming the new blatantly nationalist curriculum, the lies about the necessity of invasion told as fact, the forced military drills and oaths of loyalty forced on initially bored and apathetic children.Mr Nobody Against Putin is screening at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution Continue reading...","Sun, 26 Jan 2025 00:59:26 GMT",0.0258,0.9322

The Guardian,Good Ange is now Bad Postecoglou and caught in the Premier League doom spiral | Jonathan Wilson,"Irritable and resentful, the Spurs manager is not unique in being unnerved by a remorseless league where every game is a testLong before he began experimenting with the mind-expanding potential of psychedelic mushrooms, Timothy Leary was a psychologist. In 1957, he came up with the interpersonal behaviour circumplex, which sought to represent personality using two dimensions: power and love. While relationships on the power axis were oppositional – that is, dominance inspires submission and vice versa – on the love axis they are reflexive: hostility inspires hostility and cooperation inspires cooperation.This was subsequently developed by Emily and Laurence Alison at the University of Liverpool. In their 2020 book Rapport, they use animals to express the four basic characteristics: a lion for control, a mouse for capitulation, a T-Rex for assertiveness and a monkey for cooperation. None of these are intrinsically good or bad: the lion could be inspiring and supportive, but he could also be patronising or dictatorial. And nor are many people represented by a single animal.

The Guardian,Constitution Hill survives scare to make it 10 out of 10 in Unibet Hurdle,"1-12 favourite wins at Cheltenham despite stumble at lastNico de Boinville: ‘That gave everyone a heart attack’It is billed as “Trials Day” ahead of the four-day Festival meeting here which opens in just over six weeks, but 20,000 spectators were very much living in the moment here on Saturday as Constitution Hill, perhaps the finest hurdler of all time, went to post for the Unibet Hurdle as a 1-12 favourite, looking to extend his perfect nine-from-nine career record into double figures. And, as it turned out, one moment in particular: the split-second when he got in too close to the last, before paddling through and keeping his partnership with Nico de Boinville intact.Constitution Hill’s starting price – some were brave, or confident, enough to back him from 1-10 to 1-12 at the off – ensured that he had already set one new mark, as the hottest favourite to race at Cheltenham this century. For a heart-stopping instant, though, it seemed that he might also be the shortest-priced loser, before the eight-year-old regained his momentum and set off up the hill, crossing the line three lengths in front of Brentford Hope, the 10-1 second-favourite.

The Guardian,Rachel Reeves has to come up with some novel ideas if growth is going to happen | Observer Editorial,"Engaging with councils, universities and developers will be key to bringing the economy back to lifeIt has been a tough beginning to the year for Rachel Reeves. The chancellor has found herself in the spotlight as debt interest costs spiralled, while consumer and business confidence fell. Manufacturers, hampered by high energy costs and the consequences of Brexit, are struggling, while Donald Trump’s threats against those who dare to trade with the US are unsettling.It’s not a completely new situation. Since the budget, Reeves has been criticised for the mix of tax rises and higher borrowing needed for what is only a modest rise in government spending over the next couple of years. Businesses are angry that much of the tax burden has fallen on them. Consumers, uncertain about the nation’s prospects, hunker down. If they spend big, it’s on a foreign holiday to escape the gloomy atmosphere at home. Continue reading...","Sat, 25 Jan 2025 19:00:30 GMT",0.5994,-0.836

Animals – unless captured by humans or infected with zombie parasites – tend to act staunchly in their own interests.

The Guardian,The Observer view on the Russian aggression: Trump should heed Ukraine’s call for peace through strength,"The conversation is no longer just about the present conflict, there is already an undeclared covert war under wayDonald Trump’s characteristically vociferous attempt last week to pressure Vladimir Putin into ending the war in Ukraine, which Russia’s leader launched three years ago next month, is a welcome shift. Throughout the US election campaign, the Republican candidate complained about the cost of military aid to Kyiv. He claimed the war would never have started had he been in the White House, and boasted he could end it “in 24 hours”. Trump also avoided personal criticism of Putin. The nature and history of their relationship has long been clouded in mystery. It still is.Yet Trump’s tone and emphasis have changed markedly since he began his second term as US president on Monday. Putin’s refusal to enter into unconditional negotiations endangered Russia as much as Ukraine, he said. “I think he should make a deal. I think he’s destroying Russia.” Overt threats quickly followed. Russia’s economy was imploding, Trump said. Putin should “settle now and stop this ridiculous war” or face US tariffs, taxes and additional sanctions. “We can do it the easy way, or the hard way – and the easy way is always better.” Continue reading...","Sat, 25 Jan 2025 18:00:27 GMT",0.6705,-0.9794

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Trump’s first days: the overload is intentional | Editorial,"The US president has issued a blizzard of edicts and announcements. Determining where to focus the fightback will be difficult but essential Waiting for Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday was like watching a tsunami gather force. Everyone could see the threat approaching. But its scale was still shocking as it hit land, and what damage it wreaks will ultimately take months and years to determine.The deluge is intentional. For supporters, there is a sense of unleashed macho, almost messianic energy – setting the US on a path to national destiny which might take in Greenland, Panama and ultimately Mars. This time Mr Trump has an electoral mandate, a compliant team with a ready agenda, the obsequiousness of billionaires who command the attention economy, and a compliant supreme court which has already granted the president extraordinary power. He aspires to the rule of a monarch. The flood of executive orders, pardons and pronouncements is intended to overwhelm and intimidate, but also to disorientate&nbsp;opponents.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on The Traitors: television for dark times | Editorial,"The hit show has been compared to cosy crime drama. But it also has parallels with Hilary Mantel’s historical masterpieceDoomy towers, candlelit assignations, whispers in corridors, banishments in the dead of night and a cruel and capricious master – The Traitors has more in common with the prestige historical drama Wolf Hall than you might expect. Based on Hilary Mantel’s Booker prize-winning trilogy following the life of Thomas Cromwell, The Mirror and the Light, its final instalment came to its&nbsp;bloody end in December. In January, the treacherous skies over 16th-century Hampton Court shifted to storm clouds swirling over Ardross Castle in&nbsp;Scotland for the return of the hit reality TV show. Dark times call for dark television.The Traitors might be a spin on the cosy crime formula (strangers in a country house, murder and amateur sleuthing), but the parallels with Mantel’s trilogy are also striking. The English Reformation divided the faithful, after all. In the politics of the Tudor court and The Traitors castle, it’s all about manipulation, power and self-preservation. Everyone is jockeying for&nbsp;favour, watching their backs, backstabbing and trying to fill the coffers for themselves and their cronies. By the final episode, most of the main characters end up with their heads on the block. All of&nbsp;which makes Claudia Winkleman Henry VIII, but&nbsp;with better hair and knitwear.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,We show we’re human when we put pen to paper | Letters,"Students of literature in future will have far less to go on if handwriting becomes obsolete, writes Dr Claire Nicholson. Plus letters from Michael Daley, Alan Sekers, Alan Gough, Dr Emile de Sousa and Marie PatersonThe loss of handwriting skills has far-reaching implications beyond the ability to guide a pen across paper (Signature moves: are we losing the ability to write by hand?, 21 January). I have been privileged to introduce students to the manuscript of Virginia Woolf’s essay Women and Fiction, which was later revised and expanded to become the celebrated text A Room of One’s Own. The impact of seeing her hastily scrawled words in purple ink with crossings-out as she sought the perfect word is a joy to witness and something that will never be matched by the typewritten word. What will a literary archive look like to the students of the future, if it only exists as typed words on a screen? I doubt it could ever reach the same level of excitement.Dr Claire NicholsonChair, Virginia Woolf Society of Great Britain• The disappearance of handwriting is alarming for all the reasons given by Christine Rosen – but while hand-forming letters certainly increases cognitive skills, so too can tracing them. An elderly art school colleague once explained how he’d been trained to draw capital Roman letters as a student at the then South Kensington art school (later the Royal College of Art). Students had been required to trace a large sample Roman capital letter on arrival every morning – until they no longer needed to do so, having internalised all its properties, at which point daily tracings of the next letter began. Every student left the school able to draw Roman letters freehand. It would seem that even a thing drawn, even “mechanically”, is a thing better remembered and understood.

The Guardian,Floating Points review – an unclassifiable triumph,"Here at Outernet, LondonOn the first of a three-night London residency, British dance producer Sam Shepherd conjures up a transcendent set that’s equal parts body-jacking rave and harp-laced, retina-melting art showMost people would not bring a harp to a rave. But UK producer Floating Points – Sam Shepherd – is emphatically not most people: an uncommon artist as au fait with acoustic instruments and spiritual jazz as he is DJing to a delirious club.There are a great many people who can push faders while bobbing about, headphones half on, half off. But few have Shepherd’s range. On his spatial, guitar band-adjacent album Reflections: Mojave Desert (2017), he used mountains as reverb, blasting his music into the California hills and then recording what came back. His celebrated 2021 record Promises looped the London Symphony Orchestra in with jazz saxophonist Pharoah Sanders. It was Sanders’s last recording before he died in 2022.

The Guardian,Sky Force review – Akshay Kumar stands tall in threadbare air-war flagwaver,"Kumar does his best to inject some humanist gravitas into a film set during the 1965 India-Pakistan war, that is otherwise obsessed with duty and sacrificeThe hope is that the Hindi mainstream is learning from its current spell of commercial turbulence. The evidence, alas, suggests otherwise. For Republic day in 2024, we got Fighter, a glossy all-star flypast that aped Top Gun: Maverick with added flagwaving; despite a considerable promotional push, it divebombed at the box office. This year, we get Sky Force, a period variation on much the same theme, unpicking the fallout from an Indian strike on a Pakistani airbase during the conflict of 1965. While avoiding complete crash-and-burn, directors Abhishek Anil Kapur and Sandeep Kewlani are but tinkering within an increasingly resistible framework.For starters, this sortie is sober rather than flashy. Scenes are timestamped to underline the factual basis; the xenophobia gets dialled down as far as the genre allows. Yet the arms budget has also been slashed in Fighter’s wake. It’s not so noticeable on the ground, where Akshay Kumar’s upright Group Captain Ahuja briefs his squadron of young Tigers: flyboys with try-hard call names like Cockroach, Panther and Bull. (Imperfectly-chiselled, almost-hunky newcomer Veer Pahariya draws the short straw as Tabby, Sky Force’s own Private Ryan.) You can’t, however, miss the cheapness up in the air, where every dogfight has the look of cutscenes from a mid-90s PlayStation game. Continue reading...","Sat, 25 Jan 2025 15:36:19 GMT",0.0,-0.2617

While employed as a city planner and academic at the University of Chicago Gates had, he explained to me as he drove, become haunted by a fundamental question: why is it so often that the people with the least amount of imagination and the most concern for the bottom line – real estate developers – get to choose how to transform derelict urban areas? Why not the people who might care about those areas most: the citizens who grew up there and live there? Continue reading...","Sat, 25 Jan 2025 15:00:23 GMT",0.0,-0.6848

I had a great time with my 13-year-old and her Ethiopian pal, who assured me of her skill in this department thanks to the traditionally spicy food her family eats at home.We tasted the sauces on their own and with food. Both are essential: with the first drop, you’re looking for the flavour profile and overall taste; with the second mouthful on food – in our case a margherita pizza – you’re looking for how the heat and flavour of the sauce cut through. The moment the heat from the chillies comes into contact with food, especially carbohydrates and fats, the potency is reduced and the heat is sucked up. If you want a sauce to season food and enhance its flavours, then you need more heat than is obvious, and definitely more heat than when tasting the sauces on their own.

The Guardian,‘Everyone can benefit from handwashing’: how a new device is improving access to hygiene,"Inspired by watching his son playing in the bath, engineer Daigo Ishiyama created a tap that works without the need of running waterWhen Daigo Ishiyama contracted Covid in the spring of 2020, he felt grateful knowing he had the basics in place to keep his family safe. “In the developed world, we tend to take access to water, sanitation, and hygiene for granted,” he says. “But a steep inequity in access means many go without these basic human necessities – I knew I was among the lucky ones.”The global pandemic was a stark reminder that one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of a virus is also one of the most direct: handwashing. But according to Unicef, 25% of the world’s population – about 2 billion people – still do not have access to basic handwashing facilities at home; in some of the least developed countries, it is as high as 75%.

I can be a little dramatic sometimes. But honestly? Not about this. I have never known agony like it. An older pain, the kind caused by far more shocking blows dealt to me in the past, seemed to lie dormant in my bones until the anguish of heartbreak reanimated it. I felt all of it – the old pain and the new – erupt at once. My body was burnt up by it.In part, the devastation was caused by the rupture catching me unaware, like a natural disaster no one sees coming. It had been my private little earthquake, and it razed me to the ground. Many of us have experienced this kind of breakup. The kind that nothing prepares you for. The kind that leaves you existentially unstable.

That was a side-effect of Aussie producers lowering prices to fill a gap caused by swingeing tariffs in their main export market, China. Or the rise, over the past couple of years, in wines with alcohol contents below 11.5% abv – a UK development which was at least as much about beating the threshold for new higher duty rates as it was about satisfying demand for lighter styles.

The Guardian,How writing about female cannibals changed my relationship with food,"Describing issues of autonomy, femgore, worth and hunger all had ain impact on what I wrote and how I felt about myself, says Lucy RoseMy conflict with food began before I was born. According to family lore, I couldn’t be sated, even in utero. I consumed everything, apparently putting my twin at such risk that we were delivered prematurely. There are even stories of me climbing into my twin’s crib late at night and stealing their milk bottle, swapping it out with my empty one. I’ve always felt hunger, but I soon learned to associate “want” with shame.In 2020, I started working on a novel about mother and daughter cannibals, who lure lost souls to their rural forest homestead and bake them into pies and stews. It wasn’t a conscious choice to write about women with a carnal desire to feast, but slowly, deep into drafting – which is a very physical act for me because I write by longhand – I realised that my relationship with food and consumption was changing. Exposure to these women, who binged without guilt or inhibition, forced me to confront my fraught relationship with food, and in turn, eventually, heal it.

The Guardian,Southport attacks: the failures that allowed Axel Rudakubana to kill – podcast,"The murders of three little girls in the seaside town led to horror – and then racist riots. Now the teenaged killer has been sentenced to 52 years. Josh Halliday reportsIt was hard to imagine a more unlikely place for horror to unfold than a community centre holding a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in the sleepy seaside town of Southport.
