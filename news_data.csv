He ended by claiming that the US had given more than three times as much aid to Ukraine than the rest of Europe combined. You could almost hear Vladimir Putin cheering from the sidelines.

The Guardian,Kontinental ’25 review – scattergun satire on a tour of Romania’s social ills,"A bailiff has an identity crisis after a tragedy in Radu Jude’s new film, a scornful polemic on 21st-century Europe set between hope and despairOnce again, Romanian film-maker Radu Jude has given us a garrulous, querulous movie of ideas – a scattershot fusillade of scorn. It is satirical, polemical, infuriated at the greedy and reactionary mediocrities in charge in his native land and wobbling on an unstable cusp between hope and despair. Like his previous film Do Not Expect Too Much From the End of the World (whose lead actor Ilinca Manolache appears briefly in cameo here), Jude takes aim at bad faith and bad taste and takes us on what is almost a kind of architectural tour of Romanian malaise – this time in Cluj – in which he shows us the racism, nationalism, and a pointless obsession in the country’s governing classes with real estate and property development as a kind of universal aspiration. The movie closes with an acid montage of seedy public housing juxtaposed with gated private estates. And like the previous film, there is a repeated visual trope of a woman driving in a car, shown in profile, driving, driving, driving, looking for something – anything.Kontinental ’25 is loosely inspired by Roberto Rossellini’s Europa ’51, in which Ingrid Bergman’s character is radicalised by a tragedy in her own life – a poster for this is shown in one scene in which our heroine is getting drunk in a cinema bar. Eszter Tompa plays Orsolya, a former law professor who has apparently lost her job and now humiliatingly works as a bailiff. She is now tasked with evicting a homeless, depressed man holed up in the squalid basement of an apartment building bought by a German property firm who intend to raze it to the ground and replace it with a luxury boutique hotel called the Kontinental (a building much bigger than the original and clearly conceived with minimal interest in the existing architectural forms).

The Guardian,‘That episode is in the bin!’ Dave Gorman on his return to TV – and dropping Gregg Wallace,"The check-shirted Googlewhacker is back with another series of Modern Life Is Goodish. The comic talks about finding life’s joyful side, setting fiendish crosswords – and his low-key calamity with the MasterChef hostDave Gorman’s comic dissection of 21st-century coincidence and absurdity is back after a seven-year hiatus, for a sixth season that was meant to run for four episodes. But check the schedules and you’ll notice there are only three episodes of Modern Life Is Goodish. What happened? The answer lies in the sort of low-key calamity that feels very Dave Gorman.“We made four,” the comedian explains. “But one of them is 75% about Gregg Wallace. It’s in the bin.” This lost, cursed Goodish episode was filmed and finished just as news broke that Wallace, a presenter on BBC1’s hit cookery show MasterChef, was the subject of multiple accusations of inappropriate behaviour – which he has denied – instantly cancelling the cult hero status Goodish was drawing on. “It’s sort of taking the piss out of him but in a very loving way, tongue in cheek,” says Gorman. “There’s a routine that sets up the idea that I’ve invented a product. I need to get a celebrity endorsement for it. The punchline tying all the routines together is that he’s filmed an advert for it.” Continue reading...","Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:56:29 GMT",0.0,0.0134
The Guardian,The Monkey review – slapdash splatter comedy is a grating misfire,"Writer-director Osgood Perkins follows up horror hit Longlegs with a tiresome, juvenile adaptation of a Stephen King short story about an evil toy monkey“Everybody dies and that’s fucked up” is the tagline and emo ethos of snarky Stephen King adaptation The Monkey, a film about the inescapable inevitability yet goofy silliness of death. The writer-director Osgood Perkins, who scored a hit with last year’s Longlegs, knows more about it than most. His father, the actor Anthony Perkins, died of Aids when Osgood was 18 and then his mother, the actor and model Berry Berenson, died in the September 11 attacks as a passenger on Flight 11. Perkins has found a way to work through something so unimaginably awful with a career as a horror film-maker, and his latest, focused on twins cursed by generational trauma is his most obviously personal film yet.To his credit, Perkins has chosen not to wallow in the grim dirge associated with trauma and the horror genre. The original script for The Monkey had apparently delivered its central conceit – a toy monkey that brings death to those around it – with a straight face, something he found to be discordant, insisting a lighter, comedy-over-horror makeover. But the humour here is far too smug and nihilistic, similar to the grating can-you-believe-we’re-doing-this swagger of the Deadpool series, so happy with itself that it doesn’t really care if anyone else is smiling too. The film has a juvenile middle-finger-up attitude that confuses broad fuck-the-world misanthropy for actual edginess, annoying enough for a scene but close to insufferable for an entire movie. It’s also a tone that doesn’t really work for a King adaptation and when a flash of his earnestness does shine through, it’s uncomfortably out of place, providing more of a jolt than any of the ineffective death scenes which rely on brash and empty Looney Tunes violence. If the aim is numbing us to the shock of a violent death then perhaps the film succeeds but surely we shouldn’t be quite so bored by it too.

I stared at it for a long time, possibly without drawing breath. Martin and I grew up living next door to each other. He now lives in Australia. It was from there that he sent me a screenshot of Google Maps’ Street View, showing what had been our homes. Side by side, just bricks and mortar obviously, but teeming with meaning for both of us. That wasn’t the thing though. The thing was that in a corner of the photo stood a familiar figure in a red jumper. My dad.He died this time last year.

Do not fear: the Duchess of Sussex is on hand to explain all In these days of darkness we must take delight where we can find it, and one reliable source is the Duchess of Sussex. In her latest venture, Meghan, who occupies the tricky position of having a large platform and not enough to fill it (see also: Brooklyn Beckham), launched a new lifestyle brand that, she promised in a short video, would be “beautifully weaving together everything I cherish – food, gardening, entertaining, thoughtful living and finding joy in the everyday”. The brand American Riviera Orchard is dead. Long live the new brand, As Ever.The duchess and her husband, Prince Harry, have to do something and good luck to them, but it’s hard not to study the rollout of As Ever for signs of the widening gap between Meghan’s self-image and how the rest of the world sees her. “‘As ever’,” writes the duchess on Instagram, “means ‘as it’s always been’ or some even say ‘in the same way as always’,” the “some” in this sentence apparently referring to the dictionary definition of a two-word phrase that no one has ever had trouble understanding.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Europe is looking to Germany for leadership – but these elections will dash its hopes again | Cas Mudde,"The CDU is a big player in the European parliament, but its predicted win this Sunday won’t change Germany’s inward focusWhat a difference four years makes. In 2021, the world watched the German elections to see who would succeed the EU’s uncrowned “queen”. Angela Merkel had become a symbol of liberal democracy in the era marked by the first Trump administration. In Germany, two colourless figures explicitly vied to replace her. Deep down everyone knew that German leadership in Europe was coming to an end. But no one could have foreseen how steep the fall would be.Today, Germany is a country struggling with itself, increasingly sidelined in Europe and the world. The second Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 largely destroyed Merkel’s rosy legacy, exposing her opportunistically soft approach to authoritarian leaders such as Vladimir Putin and the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán. Under Merkel’s Social Democratic party (SPD) successor, Olaf Scholz, the country has become as pale and uninspiring as the chancellor himself.Cas Mudde is the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, and author of The Far Right Today Continue reading...","Wed, 19 Feb 2025 14:02:36 GMT",0.5719,0.6486
The Guardian,"James Murdoch has spilled the beans, and the reality is more miserable than we – or Succession – ever imagined | Zoe Williams","From the psychological torture to the inexorable rightward drift of the family business, it’s not much fun being a MurdochIt is a life-defining moment, for James Murdoch, to describe his father and wider family in an interview with the Atlantic. Much of the rough and tumble and backstabbing – Rupert essentially pitting James against the older Lachlan, in a fight that continually vexed him because his favourite (Lachlan) never won – has existed in the public domain for years as rumour. Much of it has been proved or demonstrated within reason, either by biographers – Michael Wolff in particular – or by events, culminating in Rupert and Lachlan’s legal case to secure Lachlan’s hold on the Murdoch family trust, against the other siblings, James, Liz and Prue, at the end of last year, which Rupert lost.Yet none of those machinations, spanning decades, could really encompass the sheer unbridled nastiness of this family. James describes a meeting with Rupert’s lawyer, Rupert himself sitting at the table, feigning a lack of interest. A series of questions directed to James – “Have you ever done anything successful on your own?”; “Why were you too busy to say ‘Happy Birthday’ to your father when he turned 90?” – are so loaded and needling it’s hard to imagine them emitting from any kind of professional. James recounts thinking his father was distracted, playing on his phone, only to realise that he was actually texting these questions to the lawyer.

The Guardian,New Zealand’s tourism campaign is not the world’s worst – and I should know | Arwa Mahdawi,"The slogan ‘Everyone must go!’ is being rubbished, but is it really that bad? Hong Kong and Vilnius have much stronger claims to this shameful title ...Having worked in the advertising industry for a while, I can tell you that creating a great ad is a lot more difficult than skewering a bad ad. That’s partly why I left a full-time gig in adland to focus on writing. Although the bigger reason, if I’m honest, is that I wrote a column saying I was going to quit my stupid advertising job before actually quitting, and my boss saw it and reacted as you might expect.But my poor life choices are not the point; the point here is other people’s poor choices, namely those of some marketers in New Zealand. You see, the people at Tourism New Zealand are facing international ridicule for a new advertising campaign – with the tagline “Everyone must go!” – designed to entice Australians to visit.

The Guardian,Why is Spain’s economy booming? Thanks to migration – which proves xenophobia doesn’t pay | María Ramírez,"With Spanish GDP growth leading Europe last year, diversity is making us richer – not only financially but culturally, tooThe world’s fastest growing major advanced economy last year was most likely Spain. According to preliminary official data for 2024, Spain’s GDP grew by 3.2%, almost five times the eurozone average and more than the US, which did pretty well too. In December, the Economist ranked Spain first among 37 mostly wealthy countries based on five indicators: GDP, stock market performance, core inflation, unemployment and government deficits. Forecasts for 2025 look good.Why is Spain doing so well? One key reason is immigration. Recent population flows, particularly but not only from Colombia, Venezuela and other Latin American countries, as well as Morocco, have boosted domestic demand and rejuvenated the workforce. According to the main labour national survey, nearly 90% of new jobs were filled by workers of foreign origin or dual nationality. Unemployment is at its lowest level since 2007.María Ramírez is a journalist and deputy managing editor of elDiario.es, a news outlet in Spain Continue reading...","Wed, 19 Feb 2025 07:00:30 GMT",0.3612,0.9535
The Guardian,The Guardian view on defence spending: bold ideas needed to have guns as well as butter | Editorial,"As Europe innovates to boost defence without public service cuts, Britain clings to fiscal restraint – an unaffordable risk in an unstable worldWhen settling wars rewards lawlessness, displaces populations and fuels lasting grievances, the result is more war. That was the former foreign secretary William&nbsp;Hague’s verdict on Donald Trump’s approach to peacemaking, drawing lessons from the Balkans, the second world war and the Middle East. A more insecure world will require Britain to increase defence spending. The UK currently could not sustain major troop deployments in Ukraine, undermining the idea it&nbsp;could provide Kyiv with “security guarantees”.This is a dilemma faced across Europe, leading the EU to see deficit-financed defence spending as the answer. In contrast, Britain remains seemingly bound by economic orthodoxy, prioritising fiscal discipline over borrowing. The UK Treasury has apparently asked unprotected public services – excluding health, education and defence – to prepare for real-terms cuts of up to 11% ahead of June’s spending review, as funds are diverted to the military.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Labour and the constitution: respect judicial independence | Editorial,"The rule of law is under threat around the world, making it all the more vital to defend it at homeSeparation of the judiciary from other branches of power is a recent innovation in Britain’s constitution. The supreme court was established in 2009 and a culture of respect for the independence of the courts is&nbsp;not deeply entrenched.Earlier this week, Lady Carr reminded Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch of that duty. The lady chief justice rebuked the prime minister and the Conservative leader for exchanges in the Commons last week regarding a court decision in the case of a family of refugees from Gaza. Earlier this year an immigration tribunal recognised the validity of their entitlement to settle in the UK under the European convention on human rights, overturning a previous refusal. Mrs Badenoch said this was the wrong decision&nbsp;and challenged Sir Keir to agree. He did, adding that the decision should not stand and that the relevant “legal&nbsp;loophole” would be closed.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"Right to buy is wrong, and Labour must take action | Letters","Readers respond to Aditya Chakrabortty’s article on the council housing selloff initiated by Margaret ThatcherIt shows a contemptible want of courage that Keir Starmer’s government fails to follow the examples of Scotland and Wales by simply ending the right-to-buy scam (Call it Thatcher’s timebomb: the great council housing selloff, a crisis hidden in plain sight, 13 February).There are 700,000 long-term empty homes in England, which is almost double the number of homeless people. The temporary accommodation of these families is a needless drain on local governments’ stretched budgets. Some of these homes are in areas of high demand, such as London, and some are owned by councils, which are either are too cash-strapped or so depleted of in-house skills that they cannot get around to putting them into habitable condition.

The Guardian,New towns must be built on old values | Letters,"Readers respond to our editorial about the potential pitfalls in Labour’s plans for new homes and new townsYour editorial (16 February) correctly identifies the business model of private housing developers as the large hole at the centre of Labour’s ambitious plan to build 1.5m new homes by the end of this parliament. In recent years, most large developers have been doing very well in terms of profit margins and shareholder returns without having to increase their output at all. Why should they bother to do more?The only way the government will get close to its target is by stumping up the money for investment in new social homes, exerting stronger control over increasing land values along the way. It was a lesson learned nearly 80 years ago by Aneurin Bevan. In his stint as housing minister, the postwar Labour government built more than 160,000 council homes a year – in the teeth of acute austerity.

The Guardian,Trent Alexander-Arnold rescues point for Liverpool in thriller at Aston Villa,"Arne Slot may find it difficult to decipher and digest a draw that ultimately tightens their grip at the top. Given how close Donyell Malen came to snatching a 95th‑minute winner, though, perhaps it will be easy enough. Trent Alexander‑Arnold rattled in a second-half equaliser to maintain Liverpool’s unbeaten away record in the league but a point was a frustrating takeaway given Darwin Núñez missed a glaring chance to put his side 3-2 up.How much encouragement will this result give Arsenal, eight points behind the leaders with a game in hand? Diogo Jota also missed a brilliant chance for Liverpool, who seized the lead through Mohamed Salah, before goals by Youri Tielemans and Ollie Watkins put Villa – for whom Marcus Rashford made his first start since joining on loan from Manchester United – in front at the interval.

Most of the time, they would call me over and say, “You’ve got to photograph this!”’I hadn’t met Aquilla Flemming before I photographed her giving birth. I was sitting on my couch at home when her midwife Chemin texted to say there was a woman in labour and she had given permission for me to take pictures. It was my day off, so I hesitated at first. But as soon as I got to the birthing centre I was glad I had come.When I arrived, Aquilla and her partner were outside, under a pepper tree. She was sitting on a birthing ball and they were holding hands. It was such a beautiful moment – the birth was special from the outset. Chemin had worked with Aquilla’s mother too, so there was this generational thing. The woman holding Storie, as the baby was called, is a student midwife. It was taken right after Storie was born. She’s still connected to the placenta – you can see the cord in the bottom of the frame. Continue reading...","Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:06:47 GMT",0.743,0.9325
The Guardian,Pay to get playlisted? The accusations against Spotify’s Discovery Mode,"Discovery Mode gets artists noticed in exchange for a 30% royalty reduction. A new book suggests that the platform is squeezing musicians and misleading listenersIn November 2020, Spotify published an opaque headline on its company blog: “Amplifying Artist Input in Your Personalised Recommendations.” The post introduced a new program called Discovery Mode, which would ask artists to accept lower royalty rates in exchange for algorithmic promotion. It was pay-to-play, but Spotify introduced the scheme using neutral language: artists would be able to “identify music that’s a priority for them”, which would become one of “thousands” of data inputs influencing how Spotify delivers “the perfect song for the moment, just for you”. Rather than charge an upfront fee, “labels or rights-holders agree to be paid a promotional recording royalty rate for streams in personalised listening sessions where Spotify provided this service”.Participating artists and labels take a 30% royalty reduction on tracks enrolled in the program, when they are discovered through its channels. Only tracks more than 30 days old are eligible. Notably, there have been no signs that Spotify plans to publicly label which songs are enrolled: a lack of disclosure that has caused many music advocacy groups to liken Discovery Mode to the radio payola of the 1950s, which was eventually outlawed by the US Federal Trade Commission. (Though the company points out that it has published a broad guide to understanding recommendations on Spotify, including a paragraph on “commercial considerations”.)

The Guardian,"15 of the best men’s jumpers, from cashmere and cable knit to merino wool","Whether you’re searching for a lamb’s wool layer or a stylish sweater vest, upgrade your knitwear with these instant classics• The best boots for men: 14 favourites, from Chelsea to brogues to westernKnitwear, like most menswear, is best done classic. As with other staples – denim, T-shirts, tailoring et al – it’s an investment that will go beyond any trend or season. So, if you buy the right pieces, you’ll likely wear them for years to come.With that in mind, there are a few things to consider when hitting the shops. Above all, it’s best to choose jumpers you know are made well, using good fabrics. That means you should go for brands you can trust in terms of craftsmanship and stick to natural fibres, such as cotton, wool and cashmere. Unlike human-made textiles, these are naturally breathable and temperature-regulating so they’re more comfortable and better for your skin. This sometimes means the price is a little higher than a fast-fashion buy, but they tend to last longer – just be sure to keep them protected when moth season hits.

The Guardian,I muffle my cries of passion – but the noise is upsetting my partner’s teenager,"Slammed doors and avoidant behaviour have alerted me to the 18-year-old’s discomfort. How can I persuade my lover that this is a problem?I’ve been dating a man whose 18-year-old kid lives with him full-time. My partner and I are very intimate and I always thought that I kept my cries of passion down by screaming into a pillow. Recently, his kid began slamming doors and cupboards very loudly to let us know that they had heard us. I told my partner that I felt bad, but he said he didn’t think I was being loud and that he had already explained to his kid when they chose to live with him full-time that this would happen. I don’t have the best relationship with his kid because I very rarely spend any time with them, and they are quite introverted. What’s more, recently they were avoiding eye contact with me and seemed uncomfortable. Now, I’m afraid that I’ve made them unhappy by simply being there. I don’t spend very much time with the man I’m dating, which I think sends a signal to his kid that I’m mostly a sexual partner (I would like more but am afraid of asking for it for fear of being turned down). I want to respect his kid, but I also sense that they don’t respect me because my relationship with their father is not one of a bona fide girlfriend.

It’ll require a little forward planning, since you’ll need to have the goods on hand for whenever a puttanesca hankering strikes – but truly, capers and olives should always be in there anyway, because they’re shortcuts to flavourtown.

When choosing the best fish in tins from a sustainability perspective, look for labels and logos such as a Marine Stewardship Council “blue tick”. As far as fishing methods go, “dolphin-friendly” is just the beginning, so scan for words such as “pole-and-line caught” or “FAD-free purse seine”.

The next moment, the mundane scene descends into the stuff of nightmares. In a video released by South Yorkshire police, which looks as if it has been caught by a doorbell camera, a 47-year-old man has a large black dog, tail wagging, on a lead. Seconds later, the man is being rolled across the road like a carrier bag tumbling in the wind. The muscular dog, perhaps disturbed when the man attempts to untangle the lead from his paws, leaps at him, and then, joined by a second large, loose dog, knocks him to the ground. A 14-year-old girl attempts to intervene, to a soundtrack of piercing screams.The attack, which unfolded in Sheffield last autumn, left the man with deep cuts and puncture wounds, while the teenager suffered minor injuries. A man and a woman were arrested on suspicion of possession of a dangerously out-of-control dog. And the breed of the dogs?

Instead, it became a dumping ground for Europe’s rubbish","When China stopped receiving the world’s waste, Turkey became Europe’s recycling hotspot. The problem is, most plastics can’t be recycled. And what remains are toxic heaps of trashOn a chilly evening in late 2016, a few miles from the Turkish city of Adana, a Kurdish farmer named İzzettin Akman was sitting on the second-floor balcony of his concrete ranch house when a construction truck backed up to the edge of his citrus groves, paused, then dumped a great load of rubbish along the roadside. Before he pulled away, the truck’s driver set a paper bag on fire and tossed it on top of the garbage, triggering an outpouring of flames blacker than the night sky into which they ascended. Akman leapt up, put on his sandals and sprinted out along his dirt driveway toward the crackling trash pile.The trash, by the time Akman got to it, was a hissing mass of fire. Plastic is less flammable than wood or paper, though it emits more heat as it burns. It is at least as capable as either of getting swept up in a gust of wind and, in Akman’s case, setting alight about 50 acres of orange and lemon trees. “Son of a bitch!” Akman wheeled around, ran back home, located a bucket, then rushed back to the conflagration, which he began dousing with water lifted out of a stream by the edge of the road.
