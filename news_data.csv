The Guardian,Automatic voter registration may be an answer to UK’s troubling turnout gap,"Experts say evidence from abroad shows AVR is effective – and it’s one of several proposals to try to boost votingA healthy democracy depends on people participating in it. In the UK, the proportion of people doing so is falling. Voter turnout in general elections stayed above 70% from 1945 through to 1997, hitting more than 80% in 1950 and 1951. But it collapsed to 59.4% when Tony Blair won his second term in 2001, and though it rose again between 2010 and 2019, it has not reached the 70% mark since 1997. In the 2024 election, turnout fell to 59.7%.The decline has been acute enough to trigger concern among Labour officials. Before July, the Guardian revealed they were drawing up plans to introduce automatic voter registration (AVR). In the election, when it came around, just 52% of adults living in the UK exercised their right to vote – the lowest proportion since universal suffrage was introduced. Crucially, this statistic counts all adults eligible to vote in the UK, not just those registered on the electoral roll. Continue reading...","Wed, 01 Jan 2025 17:26:08 GMT",-0.5423,0.4342
The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: New Year’s Day drone strike kills two in Kyiv,"Explosions boomed across the morning sky as Ukraine’s air force warned of incoming drones. What we know on day 1,044See all our Ukraine war coverage Russia launched a New Year’s Day drone strike on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv early on Wednesday, killing two people, wounding at least six others and damaging buildings in two districts, authorities said. Explosions boomed across the morning sky as Ukraine’s air force warned of incoming drones and mayor Vitali Klitschko said air defences were repelling an enemy attack. Two floors of a residential building in central Kyiv were partially destroyed in the strike, according to the State Emergency Service. Photos posted by the agency showed firefighters dousing a gutted corner of a building and rescuers helping elderly victims. “Even on New Year’s Eve, Russia was only concerned about how to hurt Ukraine,” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on social media in response to the strike.The breakaway Moldovan region of Transdniestria cut heating and hot water supplies to households on Wednesday after Russia stopped supplying gas to central and eastern Europe via Ukraine. The severing of the gas flow was felt immediately in the mainly Russian-speaking territory of about 450,000 people, which split from Moldova in the early 1990s as the Soviet Union collapsed. “There is no heating or hot water,” an employee of local energy company Tirasteploenergo told Reuters by phone. The gas supply was cut in the early hours of Wednesday after the expiry of a gas transit agreement between warring neighbours Russia and Ukraine. Transdniestria’s leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky, said the situation was “not an easy one, but on the whole, we were prepared”.The flow of Russian gas through Ukraine stopped when Kyiv refused to extend a transit agreement amid the 34-month-old war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday described the end of gas transit as “one of Moscow’s biggest defeats”. He said it was now Europe’s “joint task” to support Moldova “in this period of energy transformation”. Russia had been pumping about 2bn cubic metres of gas a year to Transdniestria, including a power plant that provided energy for the whole of Moldova, a country of 2.5 million people that wants to join the European Union.Moldova says it is taking measures to cut its energy consumption by at least a third. It plans to meet 38% of its needs by domestic production, including 10% from renewable energy, and import the remaining 62% from neighbouring Romania. Ukraine has attacked countries that still buy Russian energy as helping fuel Moscow’s war machine, but the decision has caused mixed reactions in Europe. Slovakia, reliant on Russian gas, slammed the move. “Halting gas transit via Ukraine will have a drastic impact on us all in the EU but not on the Russian Federation,” said Slovak prime minister, Robert Fico, who has pushed Bratislava closer to Moscow since returning to power in 2023.President Vladimir Putin has ordered Russia’s government and the country’s biggest bank, Sberbank, to build cooperation with China in artificial intelligence. Putin’s instructions were published on the Kremlin’s website on Wednesday, three weeks after he announced that Russia would team up with BRICS partners and other countries to develop AI. Western sanctions intended to restrict Moscow’s access to the technologies it needs to sustain its war against Ukraine have resulted in the world’s major producers of microchips halting exports to Russia, severely limiting its AI ambitions.

The Guardian,SAS: Rogue Heroes season two review – air-punchingly good,"Steven Knight’s cool-as-hell second world war drama is back – and it’s still an utterly thrilling romp of a watch. Charge on!Man down! Steven Knight’s crackerjack dramatisation of the formation and second world war exploits of the Special Air Service returns with a snag to fix. In season one, this new elite British army regiment, and the show commemorating it, were led by Connor Swindells as David Stirling, an officer with an intoxicating blend of debonair dash and suppressed rage. But SAS: Rogue Heroes is based on fact, albeit in a scatter-gun, tie askew, stolen-your-wife sort of way, and the fact is that in January 1943, Stirling became a prisoner of war in Italy. Season two begins in the spring and summer of that year, so Stirling is duly confined and Swindells, the star, is hardly in it.Taking command now is Jack O’Connell as Paddy Mayne, previously the screaming id to Stirling’s smart ego. Can he hack it on his own? The success of the operation depends on him … Paddy Mayne is still a borderline-certifiable risk-taker and dead-eyed slayer of the faceless enemy, but his new position as a leader requires a new level of reckless bravery from the actor playing him. O’Connell is equal to the task. Continue reading...","Wed, 01 Jan 2025 22:00:25 GMT",0.7351,-0.8067
The Guardian,The Traitors series three review – this spectacular show is shaking things up,"The ludicrously camp Claudia Winkleman hit returns with a gutting twist in the opening moments – and some wild new rules. Prepare for emotional disembowelment all the way! Series three of The Traitors begins with an utterly gutting twist. Well, technically it begins with Claudia Winkleman opening a drawer of identical pairs of red fingerless leather gloves while conversing with an owl (yes, the show’s ludicrously camp Highland gothic vibe is still in full swing), but after that it’s emotional disembowelment all the way.As per tradition, a new cohort of players meet on a steam train, where they merrily bond. Unlike previous series, however, this journey is a test: there are 25 passengers on board, announces Winkleman over the public address system as the train slows to a standstill, but only room for 22 contestants on the show itself: each of the three carriages must eject one person or lose up to £10,000 from the prize fund. Everyone sits in awkward silence until three noble souls take one for the team and clamber on to the tracks. Surely this can’t really be the end of the game for our self-sacrificial trio? Is there no reward for such altruism? Is the world really so morally senseless?! Yes, as it turns out. As hope for some kind of amnesty dwindles, the message becomes crystal clear: in The Traitors, goodness gets you nowhere. Continue reading...","Wed, 01 Jan 2025 21:00:23 GMT",-0.1779,0.9839

Stripe also told the company it didn’t want to do any more international humanitarian work – a prerequisite for a crowdfunding platform that caters to the Muslim community.

The Guardian,"Gladiators Celebrity Special review – shiny, happy, deeply predictable fun","Rob Beckett, Ellie Taylor, Joel Dommett and Louise Minchin are the latest victims of the mega-tough exercise in 90s nostalgia – and it’s just as entertaining as you know it will beCelebrity … ready! Gladiator … ready! Anyone up for starting another year hankering after the 1990s … ready! Because the reboot of Gladiators is back. Again. This time, in a one-off special to get us in the mood for the second series (which, fear not, will be more of the same), four celebs whip the Sheffield stadium into a foam-fingered frenzy and induce 16 ultra ripped and unitarded folk to flex their biceps and say mildly threatening things. Or, in Viper’s case, keep stumm and look really cross. Look, I can only apologise if this intro feels formulaic. I’m afraid this is what a close watch of Gladiators, which remains the ur-formulaic TV format, does to a critic. Especially one who came of age in the 90s. We can’t help it any more than the nation can help loving the sight of two fully grown humans going at each other on plinths with giant cotton buds.First up is Rob Beckett (comedian, 38, from Bromley). He’s doing it for the slightly overweight dads watching at home and if he had a Gladiator name it would be Beaver. Because of his teeth. Which leads host Bradley Walsh, on typically smooth form, to corpse. Then there’s Joel Dommett (comedian and presenter, 39, from Bristol) who’s been training for this since he was nine and smacking his brother in the face with a broomstick. (His Gladiator name, on account of his asthma, would be Inhaler.) The female contenders are ex-BBC Breakfast presenter and triathlete Louise Minchin (55, from Chester), who gave up sport at 15, took it up again 35 years later, and is genuinely awe-inspiring; and comedian Ellie Taylor (40, from Brentwood), who deserves to win purely on the grounds that she gave birth eight months ago.

The Guardian,Phish review – spiraling jams and communal bliss at Madison Square Garden,"Madison Square Garden, New YorkUnsinkable Vermont four-piece ring in the new year with a dazzling mix of improvisation, spectacle and fan devotionPhish have long been something of a unicorn in the fabric of popular music. Operating largely outside the traditional framework of the industry, the Vermont four-piece has become one of the world’s highest-grossing touring acts without a single mainstream hit or a platinum-selling album, consistently selling out stadiums and amphitheaters across the United States for decades. Their extraordinary commercial success, built almost entirely on the strength of their live performances and anything-can-happen ethos, stands as a testament to the loyalty and dedication of their fanbase.While they have played outside the US sparingly over the years – a couple of tours of Europe and Japan, even warming up the Pyramid Stage for that Prodigy set at Glastonbury – Phish remain a uniquely American phenomenon. Nowhere is that more palpable than at Madison Square Garden, which has become hallowed ground for the band and their itinerant fans. Since their apotheotic first New Year’s Eve outing there in 1995, through the Baker’s Dozen series in 2017 – a 13-night elaborately themed residency featuring 237 songs with no repeats – their multi-night runs at the midtown Manhattan landmark have become a cherished ritual for their dedicated community. On Tuesday night, the band returned to their spiritual home ground for the fourth show of a four-night New Year’s Eve run (and 87th performance at MSG overall), delivering a marathon performance over three sprawling sets that underscored why they remain the standard-bearers of improvisational rock more than 40 years into their career.

The Guardian,"At best, 2025 will be a year of slow economic recovery. As for the worst? Brace yourselves | Larry Elliott","With threats of recession, global fracturing and increasingly angry voters, Labour’s sticky start is unlikely to get any easierThe 2020s have been a dismal decade. Five years ago, when the first reports emerged of a new virus that had its origins in the Chinese city of Wuhan, it was hard to imagine that Covid-19 would have such a devastating impact. Yet within months, the UK was in lockdown, the global economy was in a chokehold, trade flows had dried up and governments were spending freely to prevent deep recessions turning into something even more catastrophic.A second Great Depression was avoided, but half a decade on, the long-term effects of the pandemic are still being felt. Predictions that the development of new vaccines to combat the virus would prove the catalyst for a new “roaring 20s” have proved wide of the mark. The second half of the decade should be an improvement on the first half – but that’s not saying much. The good news is that a few green shoots have started to emerge.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That won't happen – so here’s what to do instead | Rupert Read","With the climate crisis hitting Britain, we must build resilience at a local level by rewilding, saving water and fighting floodsImagine, for a moment, if 2025 was the year that the UK achieved its legally binding targets of reducing dangerous carbon emissions to zero. Imagine if the Extinction Rebellions of 2019 had achieved their goal, and the government had bowed to the pressure of climate activism to meet this target. In this counterfactual reality, the world would be much saner than our own. But as the new year arrives, we’re forced to confront a stark reality. Britain is nowhere near achieving zero carbon in the next 12 months.When Extinction Rebellion (XR) was founded in 2018, the 2025 target was conceived as a clarion call to action. It was based on the need to decarbonise quickly, to mitigate the worst impacts of climate decline, and to fulfil our historical responsibility as one of the world’s largest polluters. With the new year upon us, it’s clear that decarbonisation at the scale and speed we imagined isn’t a feasible goal within our existing political and economic frameworks. And this failure brings with it some uncomfortable truths that everyone concerned about the climate crisis must face head-on. And that means, in effect, everyone: for even if you don’t feel affected by this crisis, it still affects you. Continue reading...","Wed, 01 Jan 2025 14:00:17 GMT",-0.128,-0.9905
The Guardian,Many great prime ministers overcome a shaky start – but Keir Starmer’s window is closing fast | Anthony Seldon,"Successful PMs learn on the job, and Labour’s leader needs to start 2025 by showing his party and the country he has done soThe dismissive verdicts and dire polls after Keir Starmer’s first few months in power should not unduly perturb him. Britain’s best prime ministers all faced considerable challenges, especially early on. Clement Attlee may rank as Labour’s most outstanding leader, but his position was far from secure at the time and he would have been ousted early but for the loyal support of the foreign secretary, Ernest Bevin. Margaret Thatcher endured many dark weeks and months, only feeling confident of her position after victory in the Falklands war, three years into her premiership. The end of year verdicts on Starmer’s premiership have highlighted his errors and the bad economic news, but they have precious little positive to offer beyond “he must find a narrative”.Steady on, though. Starmer believes he has a narrative, a very clear one that he has internalised in his head – which is that as Labour leader from 2020, he took a series of unpopular decisions and faced endless criticism, but he prevailed and won one of the biggest majorities in history. On the same basis, he thinks that tough medicine from him now will see the party rewarded with another handsome majority in 2028 or 2029. It’s neat. It’s compelling. But it’s a fantasy – and a dangerous misunderstanding of the kind of narrative a PM needs. If Starmer continues to hold to it he will fall, and Britain will notch up another failed premiership when what it needs most is competent government.Anthony Seldon’s Starmer at 10 will be published after he leaves No 10; he is the author of The Impossible Office?

Here’s what I thinkBlink and another year goes by: but 2025 brings a chance for a fresh start, and some reflection on where we have got to and what is to come. I don’t have a crystal ball and I can’t fully predict what the year will bring (astrology is still not a recognised science at the University of Edinburgh, where I work), but what I can do is draw on my expertise and data signals from around the world to suggest seven topics in public health – from potential pandemics to widespread weight-loss drugs – that I believe are likely to be important in the coming months.So first with the not so cheery news: bird flu will continue its worrying prominence. Since my last column, the US has confirmed the first severe case of H5N1 in Louisiana from a patient infected with the strain circulating in birds (in contrast to the mild infections in humans linked to the strain in cattle). California has also issued a state of emergency over the growing number of humans infected with the disease and concerns it could mutate further. Given how widespread H5N1 is in birds, wild and domestic, across the world, and in dairy cows in the US, human infections will continue to be detected. The question is whether these remain isolated cases, each tied to contact with an infected animal, or whether we start to see clusters of human cases in the coming months – the latter would suggest the virus could be transmitting between humans, which would be the next major step in a pandemic scenario. Let’s hope this remains a scenario and not a future reality.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh Continue reading...","Wed, 01 Jan 2025 10:00:12 GMT",-0.3818,-0.9608
The Guardian,"As a child, I couldn’t wait to change my Iranian nose. Now I’ve learned to see its beauty | Bea Dero","I photograph people with non-western features, and pay homage to our profiles and the history in our faces“So when are you getting your nose job?” was a question 11-year-old me would often hear at my Iranian family gatherings in London. I had started saving my pocket money for the procedure when I was about seven. I would spend my evenings after school pressing down hard on the hump on my nose until the skin went red. I would push the tip up and flare my nostrils the way the YouTube video on how to make your nose smaller taught me. I would sleep with tape holding the tip of my nose up, praying for changes in the morning.It is common for people with Iranian heritage to have noses that are slightly bigger relative to the rest of their features, with a pronounced bridge and a downward droop. Different to the more commonly idealised smaller, straight or sloped and upturned western nose. With continuous exposure to western beauty standards through the media and celebrities, surgical alterations to the nose became a widespread and longstanding trend in Iranian society. Post-revolution, it became a sign of status and a way for women to align themselves with their admiration for western society and its apparent progressiveness. With time, men got in on the trend too. It has become a rite of passage, where parents will typically even “gift” the procedure to their children. Continue reading...","Wed, 01 Jan 2025 12:00:13 GMT",0.5859,0.9228
The Guardian,I love to travel Europe by train. But here's what a joined-up 21st-century network needs | María Ramírez,"Passenger numbers are rising, but competing with budget airlines will take work on ticket prices, infrastructure and integrationLast August, I took the train from Trieste to Ljubljana, following a route once used by the Orient Express. Along the way, I admired the Adriatic coast, discovered that Prosecco is a now abandoned railway station dating from 1857, and felt the shift in geography as the train climbed towards Villa Opicina on the Italian-Slovenian border. Crossing into Slovenia now means little more than a change of crew.I had with me Alma, a novel by Federica Manzon set in Trieste and the former Yugoslavia that explores the region’s strong and complicated connections, frozen by the cold war and rattled by the Balkan wars. As the train crossed into Slovenia, I thought about the shared history and geography of two places that were kept apart for decades.María Ramírez is a journalist and deputy managing editor of elDiario.es, a news outlet in Spain Continue reading...","Wed, 01 Jan 2025 07:00:08 GMT",0.3818,-0.5023
The Guardian,The Guardian view on Russia and China: an old friendship poses new threats | Editorial,"Over the holidays, this column is looking ahead at the urgent issues of 2025. Today, the expansion of the partnership between Beijing and MoscowIt is almost three years since Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin declared a friendship with “no limits” – weeks before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Since then, they have retreated from such rhetorical enthusiasm. The “no limits” language was quickly dumped, probably at Beijing’s behest. When Mr Putin visited in May last year, he claimed that he and his counterpart were “as close as brothers”. Mr Xi more coolly called the Russian president “a good friend and a good neighbour”. China has conspicuously not reciprocated Mr Putin’s description of it as an ally.Yet the partnership continues to broaden and deepen, to western alarm, across economic, political and military fronts. The US Council on Foreign Relations recently assessed it “the greatest threat to vital US national interests in sixty years”. The last 12 months saw unprecedented joint military activity by Chinese and Russian forces – though the aim was probably to signal their combined might rather than pursue the interoperability that is foundational to the US-European alliance. In September, the US suggested for the first time that Beijing might be supplying direct support for the Russian war machine in Ukraine, beyond the kind of dual-use equipment it has been shipping and the essential role it plays as an export market for Russian oil. A flurry of books on the “new cold war” appeared in 2024.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Labour’s NHS reform: structural change while slashing waiting lists is a big ask | Editorial,"Over the holidays, this column will explore next year’s urgent issues. Today, the battle over the government’s contradictory plans for the health serviceThe British government’s 10-year health plan is still some months off. So is the multi-year spending review that will set the parameters around funding. But the three themes around which Labour plans to build its NHS reforms are set. Each involves a change in emphasis: from treatment to prevention, hospital to community and analogue to digital.As health policy is devolved, these plans apply directly only in England. Their impact, though, will be UK-wide, since the largest health system is bound to influence the others, and what happens to the NHS is so crucial to the UK government. In 2025 – Labour’s first full calendar year in office since 2009 – there is arguably no area in which the party is more urgently in need of results.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There were tears too as, after eight years at the club, Oscar said goodbye to fans who begged him to stay. The midfielder, still youthful-looking at 33, had closed ears as well as wet eyes and as 2024 ended, confirmed that he was headed home to São Paulo.Fans and their captain had been through a lot together: success, near misses, the exodus of other stars, the world’s longest and strictest lockdown and the financial issues that crippled some of Shanghai’s rivals. His departure not only marks the end of an era for the player and the club but also the country’s football scene. The last of the big signings made by CSL clubs in the previous decade has now departed. Much has changed since December 2016. When Oscar left Chelsea in a £60m deal he was the most recent – and ultimately one of the last – famous names to head east. Few knew at the time that the spending was slowing down.

She did not anticipate that she would spend more than six and a half years in prison. Continue reading...","Wed, 01 Jan 2025 14:00:16 GMT",-0.3612,-0.979

I approach each new adaptation of a Harlan Coben thriller under his 14-book deal with Netflix as a weary traveller on a very long journey – committed to reaching the final destination and grateful every time that we are closer to the end.It has been a funny old business, this deal. The adaptations have been churned out in a manner reminiscent of the old studio system – fast, efficiently and apparently with any actors free at the moment of casting and with little time to spare for making them stand up to great scrutiny. Or perhaps they are more like the Catherine Cookson dramas that flooded the 90s television schedules and whose formulaic pleasures can still be found when you are off sick, or otherwise in need of comfort (along with the chance to spot now-star actors in embryonic form). Coben’s are darker and more bloody, but the promise is the same: viewers will get exactly what they came for and go away content. Continue reading...","Wed, 01 Jan 2025 13:00:15 GMT",-0.296,0.9217

He bungee-jumped, tried surfing, spent a day at a theme park, splashed around to Taylor Swift songs at aqua-aerobics and had a makeover on the TV show This Morning. Hooting with joy, usually with centrist dad bod wrestled into tight wetsuit, Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, became the politician wringing the most fun out of last summer’s general election.

But how to get the texture and flavour spot on?I well remember the first time I encountered the Tex-Mex phenomenon known as queso, which is not to be confused with Mexican queso, which just means “cheese”, as opposed to queso fundido, or melted cheese of an altogether different sort. It arrived in a bowl made out of fried tortillas that was filled with orange cheese that was melted, yet not quite liquid: “Kinda like a cheese soup,” the helpful waitress said on seeing my puzzlement.Apparently I’m not alone. Austin native Melanie Haupt reports finding “people from northern California to West Virginia … pleasantly flummoxed by the magical concoction now considered ‘classic’ queso among those who went straight from baby food to Tex-Mex”. Fellow Texan Rhoda Boone tells Bon Appetit magazine that in the Lone Star state, “We try to have as many occasions as possible to eat queso … sometimes it’s just, like, Sunday lunch”. It might not be replacing the roast over here in the UK any time soon but, like its Alpine cousin fondue, it’s great fiesta food for all occasions.

We’re trying to be unobtrusive – a word often used to describe the bird that’s making the dead grasses shake. Eventually, the dunnock hops into view, climbing a swaying stem, intent on reaching dangling clusters of stinging nettle seeds. It’s so close that we could almost reach out and touch it.How often have we walked past dunnocks, which so often forage mouse-like under a hedge, without pausing to appreciate their exquisite plumage? This one has a collar of blue-grey feathers and chestnut wings streaked with black, blending perfectly with dead leaves in the depths of winter. It’s using its pointed beak with precision, like fine forceps, but for every seed it grips, several more cascade to the ground. When it turns its head into the sunlight, its eye becomes a glowing amber circlet around a pupil of polished jet. Continue reading...","Wed, 01 Jan 2025 05:30:05 GMT",0.3612,0.0707

The Guardian,"The big picture: Colleen Kenyon’s new year portrait of her twin sister, 1977","The late feminist artists explored ideas of doubling and twinship, as well as helping to redefine notions of craft skillsThe photographer Colleen Kenyon made this new year portrait of her identical twin sister Kathleen in 1977. At the time the two of them were embarking on a shared artistic journey that put them at the forefront of feminist artists interested in reclaiming and redefining “craft” skills, using photomontage and hand-colouring techniques to celebrate and ironise traditionally “domestic” artistic expression, such as scrapbooking. Over the subsequent 25 years the twins, born in 1951, pursued this practice at the Center for Photography at Woodstock in upstate New York, where Colleen became executive director in 1981 and her sister joined her as associate director. Together they developed the exhibition space and a programme of workshops to make the institution a prime mover in the advancement of women in the arts, and for artists of colour.Their own distinctive photographic ideas developed both individually and in tandem in those years. Colleen focused on intricate print-making techniques and delicate hand-colouring of female portraits, while Kathleen pursued her interest in collage, often manipulating mass-produced images of women to give them a pointed comic or political edge. Frequently, the sisters explored ideas of doubling and twinship – their academic parents had dressed them identically until they were 10, before they each insisted on making their own fashion choices – and their art examines their shared genetics and discrete characters in multiple ways.
