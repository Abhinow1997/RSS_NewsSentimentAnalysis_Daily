The Guardian,Attissogbé gives France lift-off in Six Nations with rout of scoreless Wales,"France 43-0 WalesWelsh losing run continues as Les Bleus prove too strongWorrying times for the Welsh, worrying times, indeed, for all the four teams who have a game coming up against this France team in the next few weeks. They started the 2025 Six Nations by beating Wales 43-0, a record score against them in a home game, and they did it at a canter. It’s hard to say which side of the score they’ll be more pleased with, the seven tries or the shutout. The only blemish for the French was a red card for Romain Ntamack, who was sent off for a high tackle on Dan Edwards when there were 10 minutes left to play. It did not make much difference this weekend but, who knows, maybe it will in the next one, when they play England at Twickenham.Wales have lost 13 in a row now. They looked awfully small out there waiting for the start, surrounded by flames, fireworks, and the blindingly bright blue, red and white lights, while their handful of travelling fans were drowned out by the tens of thousands of French. Their captain, Jac Morgan, gathered his men into a huddle and did his best to steel them for what was coming. Being ready for the blow, though, did not make it any easier to wear when it came. Within minutes, Morgan’s team were reeling backwards when Thomas Ramos kicked a 50-22, and Antoine Dupont barrelled his way over underneath the posts.

The Guardian,Lurker review – deviously entertaining Hollywood hanger-on thriller,"Sundance film festival: A desperate wannabe attaches himself to a singer on the rise in a darkly compelling breakout from Alex Russell, writer for Beef and The BearThere’s something remarkably assured about Alex Russell’s attention-demanding thriller Lurker, a buzzy Sundance debut that’s made with an unusual amount of self-awareness. The majority of this year’s first-time narrative films have been cursed with an overabundance of either in-your-face style or precariously stacked ideas (or, even worse, both) and a frantic need to show how much one can do, often showcasing how little can be done well.But Russell, a TV writer whose credits include Beef and The Bear, is the rare freshman who knows exactly the right balance, often choosing less when others choose too much, his film a relatively simple yet extremely confident introduction. It’s a contemporary pop-culture riff on an obsessive psycho-thriller, the kind we were flooded with in the 90s in which an outlier enters the life of someone who has something they want, recalling Single White Female and The Talented Mr Ripley as well as something more recent and comedic like Ingrid Goes West. Russell takes this formula and extracts most, if not all, of the heightened genre elements to give us something a little more grounded, dialogue more rooted in reality and a canny realisation that murder isn’t always needed to create menace.Lurker is screening at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution Continue reading...","Fri, 31 Jan 2025 19:43:51 GMT",0.5106,0.9331

I couldn’t help thinking of him this week while watching OpenAI’s Sam Altman wet his pants about the fact that a Chinese hedge fund might have made unauthorised use of his own chatbot models, including ChatGPT, to train its new little side project. This is the cheaper, more open, extremely share-price-slashing DeepSeek.As news of DeepSeek played havoc with the tech stock market, OpenAI pressed its hanky to its nose and released a statement: “We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models, and will share information as we know more,” this ran. “We take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology.” Oooooooooh! I want to say “welcome to America’s Dumbest Tech Barons”, except I can’t, because I think we all know that no law enforcement is coming to get Sam for the stuff he’s alleged to have made unauthorised use of first.

This will only escalate unless western governments actAs if this world needs more bloodshed, here comes another major war knocking on the door of the crumbling international order. This week’s ferocious assault and capture of the largest city in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) by rebels backed by troops from its tiny neighbour, Rwanda, marks an escalation with far reaching consequences beyond Africa. It also exposes the complacency of western governments, who many Congolese accuse of paving the way for this crisis.The rebellion, known as the M23, has been snowballing since 2021. In recent months, M23 seized swathes of territory as it encircled Goma, a city nestled below a group of volcanoes facing the Rwandan border. This week, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for Rwanda to stop supporting M23 and to remove its troops from Congolese territory, adding that the conflict had inflicted a “devastating toll” on civilians, millions of whom need aid. In DRC’s capital, Kinshasa, angry protesters lit fires and attacked the Rwandan, French and US embassies.Dino Mahtani is an independent researcher and writer Continue reading...","Fri, 31 Jan 2025 15:26:56 GMT",-0.5034,-0.9441
The Guardian,Give Rachel Reeves's plan for UK growth a chance | Mohamed El-Erian,"The chancellor’s growth speech was not perfect – but it is a start after decades of underinvestment in BritainPity Rachel Reeves, the chancellor of the exchequer. Before she had even got through her highly anticipated “growth speech” on 29 January, criticism flooded social media and the airwaves. Her approach is too scattered, some said, and too reliant on measures whose impact will be felt only over the long term. Some programmes run counter to the government’s environmental commitments, others said, and they are not evenly distributed across the UK. It is all too expensive. The Ryanair chief executive, Michael O’Leary, even went so far as to declare publicly that Reeves “hasn’t a clue”.Don’t get me wrong: the speech was not perfect. But perfection is not possible under the UK’s current economic and financial conditions, and to pursue an elusive optimum would be to make the perfect the enemy of the good. Moreover, Reeves’s speech did succeed in five areas. Continue reading...","Fri, 31 Jan 2025 15:39:28 GMT",0.5574,-0.7386
The Guardian,"Trump’s pick for health secretary has many dangerous views – but some good ideas, too | Devi Sridhar","RFK Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from tap water is a matter for debate. But his plans to improve school lunches and crack down on additives are laudableThe United States and Britain: two countries divided by a common language and by very different approaches to health, whether it’s how healthcare is accessed, what kind of food products are sold in supermarkets, what is advertised on TV or even what is in the water that we drink from our taps. Having lived in both countries for an extensive period, the UK, in my opinion, takes a more sensible approach to implementing pro-health and wellbeing policies, closely linked to EU regulations. But the US could soon be following suit, under a range of proposals from a surprising source: Donald Trump’s nominee for health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr. As I laid out last month, many of his ideas are potentially dangerous for public health – from bizarre conspiracy theories to anti-vaccineviews and campaigning – and completely divorced from data and reality. But a couple of them could turn out to be beneficial.For example, the US still allows certain additives banned by the UK and EUto be added to ultra-processed foods such as cereals, sweets and biscuits, despite the fact that they have been linked to hyperactivity in children. Kennedy has suggested this week that he will ban some of these in food products. Depending on what exactly he does, this isn’t a radical suggestion: it may just put the US in line with what is done in other countries. It’s the same with his suggestions to regulate the advertising of pharmaceutical products and improve the nutritional quality of school meals.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They know it’s true but refuse to acknowledge it and, more importantly, to do anything about it.There is, however, nothing comical about this situation. The hard Brexit negotiated by Johnson took the UK out of the EU, the single market and the customs union and brought an end to freedom of movement. As a result, people are paying the price through higher food bills, lower growth and therefore lower tax revenue that could and should be spent on the NHS.John Swinney is the first minister of Scotland Continue reading...","Fri, 31 Jan 2025 12:00:25 GMT",-0.1511,0.948
The Guardian,I’m a Labour MP – but the government’s ‘growth’ mission reeks of panic | Clive Lewis,"The decision to expand Heathrow is just the latest evidence that my party is chasing policies that serve profit, not peopleChancellor Rachel Reeves’s recent “big growth agenda” speech wasn’t just the expression of a vision for the economy. It was also a warning shot to wavering Labour MPs. The message was blunt: get on board with the government’s economic strategy or step aside. Growth, we were told, is the non-negotiable mission.This was not a sudden shift but a reaffirmation of her stance at Davos, where she made clear that “the answer can’t always be no”. That answer, now firmly codified, prioritises GDP growth above all else. Heathrow airport expansion is in; net zero, bats and newts are out. The promise? A revitalised economy, busy high streets and more bobbies on the beat – a Labour-friendly vision of progress designed to bolster morale and stuff leaflets with “good news” ahead of the next election.Clive Lewis is the Labour MP for Norwich South Continue reading...","Fri, 31 Jan 2025 08:00:51 GMT",-0.6652,0.9661

The Astute-class attack vessel is still being built, but on Sunday night, the Royal Navy announced that what was to become HMS Agincourt would, instead, be given the more Franco-friendly name of HMS Achilles. Up pops Grant Shapps, the former Conservative defence secretary, to dust off his opportunism and accuse the navy of bending to Labourite “woke nonsense”. It’s just like riding a bike!

When the meeting was set last year, few expected US aggression toward a European nation to be on the agenda. But initial incredulity at Donald Trump’s bellicose claims on Greenland, a Danish territory, has been followed by shocked expressions of solidarity with Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen. A bullying 45-minute phone call between Mr Trump and Ms Frederiksen was described as “horrendous”.So it begins. As Europe reacquaints itself with Mr&nbsp;Trump’s aggressive “America First” brand of diplomacy, further such provocations can be guaranteed. Fighting talk emanating from the White House will sometimes be a prelude to eventual compromise. But there can be&nbsp;no doubt that the challenges raised by the president’s second coming are&nbsp;substantial and wide-ranging.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Marcus Smith needs more to work with from England than his own magic moments | Ugo Monye,"If England can tighten up and not rely on individual brilliance, they’ll have a chance in their Six Nations clash with IrelandNot long ago you wouldn’t have thought of England as a team who produce many magic moments. Their approach at the 2023 World Cup was certainly different but, as we saw in the autumn, England can produce something from nothing. My worry is that they can be too reliant on those moments. Marcus Smith is a magician, capable of some spellbinding stuff, but there are only so many rabbits he can pull out of a hat.Put simply, England have some room for improvement in terms of precision from their launch plays. To win in Dublin for the first time since 2019 they need to show better shape and patterns, which in turn give Marcus more opportunities to do his stuff. In the autumn most of what Marcus showcased wasn’t as a result of shape or patterns, it was instinct – darting down the blindside, leading counterattacks or picking off an intercept against New Zealand.

The Guardian,England’s eight dropped Ashes catches enough to make anyone feel sick | Geoff Lemon,"Litany of errors in the field help Australia build a huge lead, with the visitors appearing mentally to be halfway homeWe may as well start with a positive. Annabel Sutherland has for some time appeared to be a next-generation Ellyse Perry, similar not only in stature but in output and style. The resemblance comes most notably when batting in Tests, with the concentration and appetite to put away short-form games and take up the tempo of the longest format, hour after hour of focus in the middle.Perry was unavailable through injury on the second day of the Women’s Ashes Test at the MCG, and Sutherland made sure that she wasn’t missed. Batting into the third session for 163, she was the biggest factor in pushing Australia to 422 for five, a lead of 252 by stumps. This made three centuries in her past four Tests, after 137 not out at Trent Bridge and 210 against South Africa at the Waca. Unflustered, for a long while Sutherland looked on track to become the first women’s player to make two double centuries. In the more expansive history of men’s Tests, doubles in consecutive innings is something only six players have achieved. Continue reading...","Fri, 31 Jan 2025 12:30:50 GMT",-0.5106,-0.296

The Guardian,‘Do you want a little experience of stalking?’: what happened when Bear Grylls offered to ‘hunt’ me in a jungle,"Celebrity Bear Hunt sees Grylls track the likes of Mel B and Boris Becker through the jungle to teach them about survival. Sam Wollaston travels to Costa Rica to see what it’s like – but things do not go to planI am slithering across the forest floor, stealthily, silently, like a pit viper perhaps? But that would make me the predator and I think I’m the prey here. Actually – to be honest – slithering and stealthily are wishful thinking; it’s more like trying to creep, a little stooped, in an attempt to be less visible to Bear Grylls, who is hunting me. Although – further honesty alert! – he’s not really hunting me. We’ll come to that.I’m trying to remember what Grylls said in his brief about how to avoid detection. A lot of things beginning with S: sound obviously, though it’s hard to be quiet here because the forest floor is covered in dry leaves and twigs. Smell is another; wish I’d gone easier on the Lynx Jungle Fresh – hopefully Bear is upwind. Shadow, silhouette and shine are also no-nos, some of which Grylls himself helped with by rubbing dirt on my face. Continue reading...","Fri, 31 Jan 2025 13:00:12 GMT",0.0772,0.9782

Referred to as “freak offs”, these events allegedly involved group sex, kink, BDSM, public masturbation and plenty of baby oil – more than 1,000 bottles of the slippery stuff was found when officers raided Combs’s Los Angeles mansion.

The Guardian,The Weeknd: Hurry Up Tomorrow review – a record that will floor you … and drive you up the wall,"(XO Music/Republic)On a somewhat exhausting sixth album, Abel Tesfaye uses Brazilian funk, punishing house and lush 70s soul to press great songs into the service of rotten lyricsIt takes precisely 20 seconds for the Weeknd’s sixth album to imply that it might also be his last. “All I have is my legacy … I’m all alone when it fades to black,” Abel Tesfaye sings over a lush bed of synthesisers that quickly takes on the influence of 80s boogie. It’s a line that feels very on brand. Hurry Up Tomorrow’s release has been promoted with billboards declaring “THE END IS NEAR”, social media posts in which Tesfaye has inferred the album is the final “beautiful chapter” in his story and interviews during which he’s suggested that a 2022 incident in which he lost his voice on stage was some kind of cosmic message: “You can end it now … when is the right time to leave if not at your peak?”It is perhaps worth noting that the same was true of his last album more-or-less: 2022’s Dawn FM was rich with end-times imagery, mentions of the afterlife and arrived accompanied by interviews in which Tesfaye announced his desire to “remove the Weeknd from the world”. A cynic might suggest that implying he’s about to retire – or at least retire the Weeknd persona that he has inhabited for the last 13 years – now seems part of his release strategy. In fairness, it feels a lot more explicit this time around. One theory is that Tesfaye is more interested in pursuing a career in film, something viewers of The Idol, the abysmal drama series he co-wrote and starred in in 2023, might consider less of a career move than a terrible threat.

Plus: is Thunderbolts* Marvel’s answer to The Suicide Squad and will Tron: Ares be as good as it looks?There are moments in life when you expect to be confronted by greatness: hearing a live orchestra swell into the opening notes of John Williams’ Star Wars theme; standing at the edge of the Scottish Highlands; watching a dog somehow open a fridge and retrieve a beer for its owner. And then there are moments when greatness sneaks up on you in the form of an 82-year-old Hollywood legend, materialising like a grumpy mirage, one metre from your face, during what you thought was a routine Disney presentation of new movies and TV shows.Harrison Ford is not a man one simply stumbles upon. He is a force of nature, a living relic of an era when leading men didn’t have to spend six months on a chicken-and-rice diet before taking their shirts off. And yet, here he is, looking suitably nonplussed with the entire concept of being on a stage, fielding questions alongside his Captain America: Brave New World co-stars in an impromptu Q&amp;A with all the enthusiasm of a guy who somehow finds himself trapped in the world’s most boring hostage video.

A writer slightly more famous than the author of the book you’re buying might have called it “whip-smart”, “illuminating” or “a tour de force”, for example – presumably so that fans of the more famous writer will take a punt on the less famous one.But soon we may not see so many of these author blurbs – Sean Manning, publisher of Simon &amp; Schuster’s flagship imprint in the US, has written an essay for Publishers Weekly explaining that as of this year he will “no longer require authors to obtain blurbs for their books”.

Yet step inside, away from the concrete and drizzle outside, and the place is airy, opulent and verging on the semi-Californian. This is movie-set Greece hewn in tones of dappled, early evening Athenian sunshine, all bronze, peach, tan and gold, and enhanced with tasteful lighting, velvety soft furnishings and comfortable leather banquettes. Before I walked in, I was just a woman in thermals with a flaky nose, but then – bang! – I’m suddenly Christina Onassis sipping a mulberry mournoraki in a rustic yet dashingly chic taverna.All this and a kitchen headed by Angelos Togias, ex of the Connaught, and with a clear vision to honour the many wonderful things about modern Greek cooking and ingredients.

At that point, British rock and pop resolutely inhabited a world shaped by punk: it was the year of 2-Tone and Tubeway Army’s Are ‘Friends’ Electric?, of Ian Dury at No 1 and Blondie releasing the bestselling album of the year. And it was a central tenet of punk that the 1960s and their attendant “culture freaks” were, as Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren put it: “fucking disgusting … vampiric … the most narcissistic generation there has ever been,” and that the decade’s famous names should no longer be afforded the kind of awed reverence they had enjoyed for most of the 70s. “No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones,” as the Clash had sung.And yet Marianne Faithfull, who has died aged 78, turned out to be the kind of famous face from the 60s that a world shaped by punk could get behind. She was living proof that the rock aristocracy were remote and decadent and ripe for the culling. Never given the credit due to her by her most famous associates, the Rolling Stones, she had to go to court to get her name appended to the credits of Sister Morphine, a song she had co-written. She subsequently spiralled downwards, at startling speed, from having a seat at swinging London’s top table to life as a homeless junkie. Her years of addiction on the streets had so ravaged her voice that, by the late 70s, it was completely unrecognisable as coming from the woman who had sung As Tears Go By and Come and Stay With Me.
