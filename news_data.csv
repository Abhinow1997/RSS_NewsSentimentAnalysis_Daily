The Guardian,Richard II review – Jonathan Bailey exudes charisma as a cocaine-snorting king of misrule,"Bridge Theatre, LondonNicholas Hytner’s production plays like a thriller, while Brigerton star Bailey glitters with feeling in a potently physical modern-dress productionLong before Bridgerton, there was theatre for Jonathan Bailey, from roles at the RSC as a child actor onwards. His ease and aptitude on stage is evident here yet he is still a revelation, lighting up this play about a king’s misrule and downfall. As the less performed opening of Shakespeare’s history quartet of “Henriads”, it is an exploration of power, reflecting on the superannuated concept of a king’s divine rule and its unseating after a rebellion by exiled cousin, Henry Bullingbrook.Nicholas Hytner, as director, smooths away most of the play’s creakiness with a pared-down production that has the pace and intrigue of a thriller. It is muscular in its look and Bailey singularly shines, his luminosity putting the others slightly in the shade. Continue reading...","Tue, 18 Feb 2025 23:30:18 GMT",0.0,0.9331

The Guardian,Gaucho Gaucho: Argentina’s Last Ranchers review – an astonishing tribute to a dying way of life,"This mesmerising Storyville documentary follows the cowboys and cowgirls who herd cattle on the Argentinian plains. You don’t watch it so much as immerse yourself in itIn 2020, Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw released The Truffle Hunters, a surprisingly affecting documentary about old men, their dogs and the search for truffles in the forests of Piedmont. Their new film, Gaucho Gaucho: Argentina’s Last Ranchers, is also about a traditional way of life that is in decline. Here, the subject is Argentinian gauchos – cowboys and cowgirls – who ride and tame horses, herd cattle and wear handmade traditional clothing. They have a relationship to the land that was forged in a different age and now exists in friction with much of the modern&nbsp;world. The film took two years to make – and&nbsp;it&nbsp;is mesmerising.A handful of characters run through the documentary, which is part of the BBC’s Storyville strand. Guada is a teenage girl in training to become a gaucho, like her father. We first meet her at school, where she is being punished for not sticking to the regulation clothing. The teacher tells her she must respect the school uniform; rules are rules. “I only feel comfortable in gaucho clothes,” she replies. It is a nice way to frame the tension between the old and new worlds. She is an outsider in both. Female gauchos&nbsp;are rare and the support from her father and her community is contagious. By the end, you are willing her to achieve her dreams. Continue reading...","Tue, 18 Feb 2025 23:15:18 GMT",0.0,0.836

The Guardian,There are many ways Trump could trigger a global collapse. Here’s how to survive if that happens | George Monbiot,"It could be wildfires, a pandemic or a financial crisis. The super-rich will flee to their bunkers – the rest of us will have to fend for ourselvesThough we might find it hard to imagine, we cannot now rule it out: the possibility of systemic collapse in the United States. The degradation of federal government by Donald Trump and Elon Musk could trigger a series of converging and compounding crises, leading to social, financial and industrial failure.There are several possible mechanisms. Let’s start with an obvious one: their assault on financial regulation. Trump’s appointee to the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Russell Vought, has suspended all the agency’s activity, slashed its budget and could be pursuing Musk’s ambition to “delete” the bureau. The CFPB was established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis, to protect people from the predatory activity that helped trigger the crash. The signal to the financial sector could not be clearer: “Fill your boots, boys.” A financial crisis in the US would immediately become a global crisis.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Tue, 18 Feb 2025 08:00:02 GMT",-0.4939,-0.9729
The Guardian,Britain must see being ditched by Donald Trump for what it really is: a great opportunity | Clive Lewis,"A line has been crossed. There is a bold, progressive way to think again about our defence and investment, social spending and foreign policyClive Lewis is the Labour MP for Norwich SouthLittle more than a year ago, Keir Starmer could be described as what Napoleon called a “lucky general”. But now, six months after a landslide election victory, “lucky” is an adjective unlikely to be found anywhere near a prime minister more usually described as having made missteps and unforced errors. And yet, perhaps, amid this tumult – a shifting geopolitical landscape, an authoritarian to the west of us conceding to the imperial ambitions of another to the east – Starmer’s luck holds. For the situation offers him an unparalleled strategic opening through which my government can find and define its purpose.The prime minister himself has called this a “once-in-a-generation opportunity”. The paradigm has shifted. It will not return to “normal”. Most significantly, the shibboleth of atlanticism – that unshakeable belief that the US-UK relationship is always right and always in our interest – has released its grip on our political imagination. We are free to define defence and security on our terms. And – as an increasingly anxious public pushes defence up the league table of concerns – we must do so.

The key culprit, in my opinion? Screen time.On a child’s first day at school, it’s normal to expect a few nerves. But they should be able to move around confidently, pick up stationery, make new friends, build a relationship with their teacher and start to feel part of a wider community. Instead, a recent survey reported that some children in England and Wales are unable to sit up or hold a pencil. I have seen kids racked with separation anxiety and unable to form bonds. Upset and confused, they miss instructions and hold back or lash out. To a busy teacher this looks like a lack of ability, or a disruptive child to be managed. Children are simply being set up to fail.Kathryn Peckham is an early childhood consultant, researcher, author and founder of Nurturing Childhoods Continue reading...","Tue, 18 Feb 2025 14:02:12 GMT",0.0,0.6249
The Guardian,Musk’s rampage through government shows us how we can finally close the book on what Trumpism is all about | Osita Nwanevu,"Trump, Musk and the Republican party are happily overriding parts of the constitution, and using means of questionable legality to cripple the federal governmentIt is humbling to realize, almost a decade into his tenure at the center of American politics and life, that Donald Trump still has the power to surprise us. As recently as inauguration day, the conventional wisdom on Elon Musk’s role in the administration was that he’d been given a meaningless post at a powerless agency whose name itself was a joke. From the “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, it was said, Musk would issue easily ignored recommendations the gullible would take as evidence that Trump was streamlining the federal bureaucracy – a promise reliably made and broken by countless presidents. Instead, in a turn of events magazine cover artists have delighted in, Musk as a “special government employee” has seemingly taken the reins of the executive branch ⁠– a de facto co-president or perhaps a vice, while JD Vance busies himself with his duties delivering social media clapbacks and jeremiads about wokeness to European leaders.For weeks now, the Doge’s fleas have been hopping from agency to agency, gaining access to key administrative and financial systems, including databases filled with sensitive information on ordinary Americans and infrastructure at the treasury that disburses trillions in payments across the federal government. One member of the team Musk installed there, Marko Elez, resigned after it was revealed he had written posts supporting, in his words, “Indian hate” and a “eugenic immigration policy” as recently as December. After defenses from Vance and Trump, he was reinstated. Meanwhile, fired leaders across the government are now seeking employment; about 75,000 federal workers have accepted a buyout from the administration. USAid has been gutted, putting the health and sustenance of countless vulnerable people around the world in immediate jeopardy, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education are now under assault. Words and whole areas of inquiry are being banned for researchers; government-wide, anything that smacks even vaguely of diversity and equity recruitment and training isn’t long for this world. What’s more, all of this comes on the heels of Trump’s extraordinary freeze on federal loans and grants ⁠– justified as a step towards rooting out “Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies” in government ⁠– which threatened programs like Medicaid, Head Start and even Meals on Wheels before it was blocked in court.Osita Nwanevu is a Guardian US columnist Continue reading...","Tue, 18 Feb 2025 16:00:10 GMT",0.0,0.5859

The Guardian,Elon Musk keeps bringing his kids to work – and the reasons aren’t cute at all | Arwa Mahdawi,"Is this fun fathering or a cynical and exploitative PR strategy from the tech billionaire? I suspect the latter ...Welcome to the White House, where every day seems to be bring-your-kid-to-work-day if you’re Elon Musk. The tech billionaire, fascist-salute-enthusiast, and de facto president of the US hasn’t just moved himself into government digs – he has seemingly moved in a selection of his kids as well. Over the last couple of weeks, mini-Musks have been popping up at high-profile political events, generating a steady stream of memes, headlines and analysis.Three of Musk’s young children were at a meeting with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi last Thursday, for example. Why were Musk and Modi meeting? Good question. Even Trump doesn’t seem to know, but told reporters he assumed Musk “wants to do business in India”. Which, considering Musk has burrowed his way deep into the US government, sounds a teeny bit like a conflict of interest. But let’s not focus on that, eh? Let’s focus on Musk’s parenting instead! Don’t ask any difficult questions, just look at the cute pictures – disseminated widely – of Modi showering Musk’s kids with gifts. Adorbs.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Trump’s diplomacy: when the US knows the price and ignores values | Editorial,"US talks with Russia over Ukraine’s future, like the president’s prescription for Gaza, highlights how business and foreign policy mergeThe Trump administration did not take red lines on Ukraine to its talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday: it cares about the bottom line. The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, underscored that when he said the two sides would create a team, not only to support Ukraine peace talks but also to explore the “incredible opportunities” to partner with Moscow geopolitically “and, frankly, economically” that might result.Kyiv and other European capitals are still reeling at the full extent of Donald Trump’s cynicism when it comes to world affairs, and callous disregard for the people caught up in them. But it should be no surprise that business dealings were high on the agenda. Vladimir Putin would dearly love to end his country’s economic isolation. Russia is making the case that American energy firms and others could profit handsomely by doing business with it again.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on the Gauke review: prison isn’t working | Editorial,"A performative ‘tough on crime’ approach by politicians has been both ineffective and ruinously expensiveIt was as shadow home secretary in the early 1990s that Tony Blair came up with “tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime” – a characteristically New Labour formulation intended to finesse a perceived vulnerability on law and order issues. Yet in subsequent decades, governments of all stripes have focused overwhelmingly on the first clause, and&nbsp;treated the second as an optional extra.The disastrous result is a criminal justice system on the brink of collapse, as the former Conservative justice&nbsp;secretary, David Gauke, has outlined in his interim report on the sentencing system in England and Wales. Cumulative Westminster pressure for longer prison terms has led to a doubling of the incarcerated population in 30 years. More draconian sentencing and greater recall of released offenders who break parole have left the prison estate bursting at the seams and necessitated ad hoc early release schemes. Labour’s plans to deliver 14,000 extra prison places by 2031 – at a cost of £10bn – will not be enough to keep pace with rising numbers.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the natural habitat of the cleaner fish is the reef.On a reef, each cleaner fish has clients that visit them to have their parasites removed – sometimes much bigger fish or predators such as sharks and rays.

The Guardian,‘Why aren’t there Oscars for what we do?’ Choreographer Ellen Kane lets rip,"From Matilda to Dear England, she is the movement director everyone wants to work with – and her work has lit up hit after smash hit. But, she says, it’s time this under-appreciated art received proper recognitionEllen Kane is on a roll. When we speak, the choreographer and movement director has two shows running, Ballet Shoes at the National Theatre, and Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812 at the Donmar. She has just finished Why Am I So Single?, the follow-up from the writers of Six, the smash hit about Henry VIII’s wives, and she’s in rehearsals for the revival of Dear England, James Graham’s funny and stirring depiction of Gareth Southgate’s tenure as England manager. If you watched all those shows in a row, you would have no idea the same person had a hand in them all, such is the art of the movement director, a job that many may not even realise exists. But it’s an essential one.“Outside actually directing a scene, everything that moves on the stage is usually done by me,” says Kane, chatting backstage at the National. That means any dance, obviously, but also scene transitions, characters getting from A to B, and working with actors on how they connect with the audience. She helps make visible a character’s emotional experience. “So that we, the audience, can feel it,” she says. “I love to feel. I can watch something and appreciate it, ‘Oh that’s beautiful.’ But do I leave moved?” Continue reading...","Tue, 18 Feb 2025 15:53:54 GMT",0.0,0.986

Her brother barely got through last month to relay the news that Snoop Dogg had been DJing at a party for Donald Trump’s second inaugural, and many in the Black community were irate. Longtime fans were calling Snoop a sellout, she learned, and were unfollowing him online by the hundreds of thousands.Snoop remained defiant in the face of this controversy, which really peeved the hordes who well remember when Snoop was regulating Maga support in the music industry. That defiance “was the thing that resonated with me”, says Michele when I initially reach her the week after Trump’s second inauguration. “We live in a different era where you can say what you think and not feel like you might die.” Continue reading...","Tue, 18 Feb 2025 13:00:06 GMT",0.5559,-0.2047
The Guardian,"15 of the best men’s jumpers, from cashmere and cable knit to merino wool","Whether you’re searching for a lamb’s wool layer or a stylish sweater vest, upgrade your knitwear with these instant classics• The best boots for men: 14 favourites, from Chelsea to brogues to westernKnitwear, like most menswear, is best done classic. As with other staples – denim, T-shirts, tailoring et al – it’s an investment that will go beyond any trend or season. So, if you buy the right pieces, you’ll likely wear them for years to come.With that in mind, there are a few things to consider when hitting the shops. Above all, it’s best to choose jumpers you know are made well, using good fabrics. That means you should go for brands you can trust in terms of craftsmanship and stick to natural fibres, such as cotton, wool and cashmere. Unlike human-made textiles, these are naturally breathable and temperature-regulating so they’re more comfortable and better for your skin. This sometimes means the price is a little higher than a fast-fashion buy, but they tend to last longer – just be sure to keep them protected when moth season hits.

A wetsuit may seem the obvious choice for winter swimming, but many open-water wetsuits won’t offer much warmth in water below 10C, and the effort of putting one on at this time of year when swims are short often isn’t worth it (see more detail below).

The Guardian,How to use up the remains of a can of coconut milk | Kitchen aide,"Dont be shy: use the last drops of that aromatic liquor in coconut rice, soup, curries and even your morning porridgeI rarely use a whole tin of coconut milk in one go. What can I do with the leftovers?Happily, the warming sweetness of coconut milk is welcome in all the things you want to eat right now, sitting at home in your thermals (Curry! Soup!), meaning leftovers are no bad thing. When Mandy Yin, chef-owner of Sambal Shiok in north London, is faced with this same predicament, it usually means coconut rice: “It’s so straightforward, too: just replace half the water you’d need to cook the rice with coconut milk.” Otherwise, the excess milk could make an appearance in stews, even bolognese, or creamed spinach, she adds: “Replace the cream with coconut milk and a dash of fish sauce, and that’s really delicious.”Coconut milk is, of course, a fundamental ingredient in Sri Lankan cooking. “You’ll find kiri hodi, a coconut milk-based sauce infused with garlic, turmeric and pandan leaf, in 90% of kitchens in Sri Lanka,” says Eroshan Meewella, co-founder of Kolamba in London, and he recommends you do the same. “The turmeric and garlic balance the quite creamy, quite sweet coconut milk, and it pairs beautifully with rice or crusty bread.”Got a culinary dilemma?

Instead, it became a dumping ground for Europe’s rubbish","When China stopped receiving the world’s waste, Turkey became Europe’s recycling hotspot. The problem is, most plastics can’t be recycled. And what remains are toxic heaps of trashOn a chilly evening in late 2016, a few miles from the Turkish city of Adana, a Kurdish farmer named İzzettin Akman was sitting on the second-floor balcony of his concrete ranch house when a construction truck backed up to the edge of his citrus groves, paused, then dumped a great load of rubbish along the roadside. Before he pulled away, the truck’s driver set a paper bag on fire and tossed it on top of the garbage, triggering an outpouring of flames blacker than the night sky into which they ascended. Akman leapt up, put on his sandals and sprinted out along his dirt driveway toward the crackling trash pile.The trash, by the time Akman got to it, was a hissing mass of fire. Plastic is less flammable than wood or paper, though it emits more heat as it burns. It is at least as capable as either of getting swept up in a gust of wind and, in Akman’s case, setting alight about 50 acres of orange and lemon trees. “Son of a bitch!” Akman wheeled around, ran back home, located a bucket, then rushed back to the conflagration, which he began dousing with water lifted out of a stream by the edge of the road.
