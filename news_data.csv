Here are the finest shows to catch up on nowThe premise sells itself: a thirtysomething woman is transported to a parallel life each time she orgasms. But, actually, this lends itself surprisingly well to digging deep into millennial frustrations, anxiety and ennui. Zoe Lister-Jones plays Mae Cannon, a New York art curator who feels stuck in a rut with her life – specifically with her longterm husband. When she cheats with another man, she wakes up in a new life where she married him, and so the cycle begins, with each new relationship forcing Mae to re-examine her identity and ideals. Does she want, or get, her original life back? No spoilers here, but without ever zapping the smart, sharp comedy that carries it through, this introspection is relatable for many.

Instead, this has been the year of green in all its glory.I thought I was being original when I re-covered my sofa in a velvet moss green only to discover that the rest of middle England were also at it. John Lewis reported that sales of green sofas shot up by 32% this year. Sofa company Loaf says similar – it launched the colour “pressed olive”, which has been its most popular to date. Independent fabric brand Colours of Arley say “lime” and “swamp” were its most-requested shades, while fashion designerturned ceramicist Henry Holland says he has spent the year “constantly remaking [olive] green-and-white striped mugs and chalices to keep [them] in stock”.

He once mailed himself across the US in a wooden crate. He says things like: “What would happen if the camera was Buddhist?” and, until now, he has never made a feature film. Not the obvious candidate to entrust with adapting a Pulitzer-winning novel, you might think, yet Ross has managed to make a movie that is socially impassioned and highly awards-friendly – and so avant garde that it almost reinvents cinema.In its subject matter alone, Nickel Boys is remarkable: adapted from Colson Whitehead’s novel, it follows two young Black boys at a segregated reform school in Florida in the 1960s. It is a story of friendship in the face of racism, injustice, abuse and even murder. The setting is based on the infamous real-life Arthur G Dozier School, where scores of unmarked graves of students were discovered in 2012.

In primary school, I’d tear through 60-odd books in a month when the annual Read-A-Thon rolled around (they were mostly Babysitters Club books, but still). Then as a teen, I discovered the quiet beauty that could be found in great novels, taking solace in those pages as hormones and high school made the real world awful.In my 20s, though, my pace started to wobble. I was still getting through 15 or 20 books a year, but less consistently. Partly this was because I had to make time for an exciting new hobby called binge drinking. But I was also increasingly distracted by the bottomless pit that was my iPhone. It always went the same way: I’d be on a roll with reading until I hit a book that just wasn’t that interesting. I’d gradually stop reaching for it at night as doomscrolling on Reddit became a more appealing prospect, then I’d look up and realise it had been a month since I’d turned a page.

These were the last glory days of broadcast television before it became largely obsolete, alongside Snow Patrol and low-rise jeans.

Divisive world events such as the US election can make matters much worse, and family relationships are increasingly becoming casualties of stark political differences. As a researcher around family estrangement, I know how challenging it can be to keep the goodwill flowing.Take Alexis, for example, who is originally from a rural town in California. He is planning to attend a large Christmas gathering with more than 20 relatives, the majority of whom voted Republican and are strong Donald Trump supporters. As an openly gay man, he struggles with some of the political talk that “the other side” brings to the table during family occasions. “It’s clear in how my relatives talk that they don’t care how my rights to live as a gay man are impacted by their vote,” Alexis told me. In the past, he has tried to establish boundaries to put politics “off-limits”, but this has not been effective. “In reality, the conversation happens anyway. Some people like to push it, and they try to get a reaction.”Becca Bland is a journalist and researcher with a specialism in family estrangement and social policy Continue reading...","Thu, 26 Dec 2024 13:00:40 GMT",-0.0498,0.8257

Let a true pitstop connoisseur be the judge of that | Rich Pelley,"With its herb garden, deli counter and ‘living roof’, the M5 stop-off is definitely swish. But I’m a Monster Munch man at heartIf you know me, you’ll know there is nothing I like better than a good old-fashioned service station. Where else can you jump out of the car for an overpriced Burger King, a go on a driving arcade game from 1993 and – most importantly – a wee? Service stations are mini utopias, housing everything that a human being needs for basic survival. Come the apocalypse, you’ll find me happily holed up in my nearest Moto.Rightmove recently published a list of the happiest places to live in Great Britain, and I suppose I can see why that might be of interest. But it was a survey of the UK’s service stations by the consumer group Which? that really caught my eye, partly for its ludicrous claim that “no one visits a motorway service station for fun”. What nonsense. Although with all the hassles of Christmas travel, I suppose some people may fail to find them quite so entertaining. In any case, ranking service stations is old news: my friends and I have been doing so for years.Rich Pelley is a freelance writer Continue reading...","Thu, 26 Dec 2024 10:00:36 GMT",0.891,0.9707

The Guardian,Are young people's attention spans really shrinking? It's more complex than you might think | Marion Thain,"Distractions long predated today’s fast-moving online world. Understanding this age-old problem could help us regain controlMarion Thain is professor of culture and technology at King’s College London and director of the Digital Futures InstituteIn late-19th-century Britain, Londoners could expect to receive up to 12 postal deliveries a day. Letters were often exchanged with the frequency that we imagine only occurred with the advent of email. Today, archives brim with scrawled missives detailing arrangements to meet for dinner that are made first thing in the morning, only to be followed by an argument unfolding in the middle of the day, culminating in a reconciliation and reinstatement of the plan to meet. All before nightfall.We tend to think of the pre-digital era as much the same as now but without our myriad digital distractions, but it was not so. With ink blots and wild fountain-pen trails going up the margins, it is clear these historical writers were dashing off many such letters in a day. With the doormat filling up with mail every hour or so, even a gentleman or woman of leisure might have been forgiven for feeling rather distracted.Marion Thain is professor of culture and technology at King’s College London and director of the Digital Futures InstituteDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Today we look at the crisis in western democracy, Donald Trump’s victory and the role played by digital mediaIn November 2020, shortly after Donald&nbsp;Trump’s defeat&nbsp;in the US presidential election, Barack Obama observed that America risked entering “an&nbsp;epistemological crisis”. The prospect of Mr&nbsp;Trump’s return to the White House in January validates his predecessor’s premonition.Mr Obama was talking about media fragmentation and polarisation: different segments of society existing in discrete information spaces; arguments no longer drawn from a common reservoir of facts; no shared reality, no foundation of truth. “Then by definition the&nbsp;marketplace of ideas doesn’t work,” he said. “And&nbsp;by definition our democracy doesn’t work.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on the House of Lords: ministers risk a hollow reform with a partisan approach | Editorial,"Over the holidays, this column will explore next year’s urgent issues. Today, why it is easier to be a constitutional reformer in opposition than in officeNext year, the remaining hereditary members of the House of Lords will finally lose their right to sit in the upper house. When that happens, a democratic milestone in British parliamentary history will unquestionably have been reached. But a milestone along a road to what eventual constitutional destination? We do not know the answer to that, because the government will not say. The government itself may not be sure. As on many other issues, Labour’s true direction of travel on House of Lords reform remains obscure.One thing, however, can already be said. Last week, Downing Street published a list of 38 new life peers. It was one of the longest such lists of the modern era. It contained 30 new Labour peers, six Conservatives and two Liberal Democrats. Many were former MPs. The overall aim, as the nominations made extremely clear, was to boost Labour’s numbers in the Lords at the expense of the Conservatives.

It’s the biggest scam, where the scammer convinces you that your property, your asset, is worth you saving up your pennies, plus a few fundraising efforts, finished off with funding applications to several do-good organisations, to buy what’s yours already.Every community centre, library, swimming pool and public building in the land was bought with the communities’ own money, as they paid through income tax and council tax to fund the public bodies that built them, as well as the running costs.

However, FDACs were not “all destroyed” following the closure of courts like Wells Street. FDACs are still operating to this day. Since they were piloted in 2008, their reach has expanded: there are now 13 FDAC services that cover 38 local authorities across England and 21 family courts, with additional services due to open in 2025. A national evaluation of FDACs published in 2023 found that children were four times more likely to be reunited with their parents at the end of proceedings compared with similar families in non-FDAC care proceedings.

Dams and dikes are erected around the lake’s edges to protect against flooding. But this year, not for the first time, they were overwhelmed.For three days in early July, more than 800 rescue workers in Hunan province scrambled to block the breaches. One rupture alone took 100,000 cubic metres of rock to seal, according to Zhang Yingchun, a Hunan official. At least 7,000 people had to be evacuated. It was one of a series of disasters to hit China as the country grappled with a summer of extreme weather.

It was on the frontline of childcare in London, and everybody will remember the strong, vivacious, articulate woman at its head. There was something about her – how she dressed and the words she spoke – that showed me she wasn’t your average founder of a children’s charity. And then there were the stories that radiated out from her. She had a meeting with the queen, and during that meeting she got a call from a child in a panic, and she took the call, left the meeting and went to that child. Most heads of children’s charities would not have that kind of contact. It made her a threat to the status quo of the sector and I liked that.We met in 2009 while I was artist-in-residence at the Southbank Centre, and the artistic director Jude Kelly wanted us to meet inspirational people who saw creativity as the heart of their practice. Down the road was Camila at the Kids Company HQ. I remember sitting in her creative office; I got such a warm feeling of welcome and ease from her. She was Iranian and she was British. She was highly educated but wore it lightly, and she was as at ease speaking to a prime minister as to a child who didn’t know how to talk to her. She wore clip-on earrings because when she worked with children who needed care and help, she was aware they might grab her ear, and that they wouldn’t know how to behave when in disturbed states.

The Guardian,The Road Trip review – this icky romcom by numbers is oddly romance free,"The first few episodes of this adaptation of Beth O’Leary’s novel feature zero chemistry between the leads. It’s one for fans of the genre onlyThe easiest way to describe The Road Trip would be to call it the TV equivalent of an airport novel. Perhaps that is because it is. Beth O’Leary has long kept the WH Smith industrial complex alive, with bestselling novels including The Flatshare, which sold more than 1m copies. That book was adapted into a six-part TV series in 2022, and followed two roommates thrust together by the fact that they rented the same bed – cleverly twisting the hellscape that is the London rental market into the stuff of a fluffy romcom. This one follows Dylan and Addie, a pair of exes thrust together by the fact that they have to use the same method of transport to get to a wedding 1,000 miles away. Like a rat, a potential love affair is never more than 6ft away in O’Leary’s world.This time, our star-crossed, claustrophobic pairing are Dylan and Addie, who are on their separate ways to the wedding of their friends Cherry and Krish. In the book, the nuptials were in Scotland. But this is TV, so it has been relocated to lush, mountainous Spain. Addie and her sister Deb – plus an uninvited guest named Rodney – are driving in a camper van from Bristol to catch a cross-channel ferry. Up the road, Dylan and his best mate, Marcus, are on their way to the airport, in a Porsche. Marcus (David Jonsson), in a role with shades of his much-missed Industry character Gus) crashes the Porsche – his dad’s – into Addie’s camper van. Although the RV sounded like a dying animal long before that, it becomes Dylan and Marcus’s only hope for getting across the border, leaving our fivesome lumped together.

The Guardian,‘I get spotted in the M&S knicker department’: Lorraine Ashbourne on her 2024 TV takeover,"From Bridgerton to Sherwood and Alma’s Not Normal, the actor has lit up our screens all year – and her ‘victory lap’ is only just starting …Lorraine Ashbourne has had a massive year. “I know! People keep saying: oh God, Lorraine, get off the telly, we want somebody else,” she says. “But it has been extraordinary.” She kicked things off in January with ITV’s entertaining disaster thriller After the Flood, playing Sophie Rundle’s tough, grieving mother, Molly. As the year went on, she returned to two of her biggest and most significant roles yet, as the former secret spy cop Daphne Sparrow in Sherwood, and Grandma Joan in the wrenching, hilarious second series of Alma’s Not Normal. Has she ended up in such outstanding shows because she’s picky? “Absolutely not. I’ll do anything! I’m a cheap date. It’s just timing that these things have fallen into place.”Right now, Ashbourne is at home in north London. She grew up in Manchester, where she went to drama school. She met her husband, Andy Serkis, there, when they were both starring in a play at the Royal Exchange, in 1989. But she has lived in London for “40-odd years, so I’m a Londoner”. The couple’s three adult children still live at home with them, and Ashbourne’s parents are staying; her father has just had his 90th birthday. “We’re run ragged. It’s a busy household.” Continue reading...","Thu, 26 Dec 2024 06:00:33 GMT",0.0,0.5762

One night at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, Hillary Clinton came with Madeleine Albright. They were both seated on time, but Bill Clinton and Chelsea, delayed by traffic, joined them in the middle of first act. Next day, I was eager to find out what the Clintons had been like. Judi had received them in her dressing room and been swept away by their charm. When I went to ask Maggie what she thought of them, she said she had refused to meet them. “Do you think I’m going to shake hands with anyone who’s late for your play?” Continue reading...","Thu, 26 Dec 2024 08:00:35 GMT",0.0,0.9267

The Guardian,Twisters! Tennis! Transformations! The best movie moments of 2024,"From edge-of-seat chases to sexy role-playing, Guardian writers pick their most memorable scenes from films released in the US this yearSpoilers aheadAmy Adams’s canine transformation in Marielle Heller’s Nightbitch should be nothing we haven’t seen before. There is a fine history of moonlit metamorphoses in werewolf movies: moans that deepen into growls, the stretching and twisting of muscle, fur sprouting at lightning speed. In fact, some people criticised this film for shying away from the body horror at the heart of Mother’s animalistic breakdown. But there is a powerful whiff of catharsis in this low-key transformation scene: watching Adams sniff the midnight air, dig with bare hands into her own tidy suburban lawn, down on her paws, fully dog in body and mind, before the hair begins to bristle on her forearms. Adams’s eerily calm voiceover (“I have one thought: I am an animal”), follows the rippling fur as her character is reborn as a galloping red husky, with a cloud of strawberry-blond hair on a muscular frame. A hunting dog with a one-track mind: “Blood! Blood, blood, blood!” And it’s curtains for the neighbourhood cats. Pamela Hutchinson Continue reading...","Tue, 24 Dec 2024 12:00:41 GMT",0.7249,0.8143

Christmas was a relatively new celebration for our family: my&nbsp;parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles had arrived in Australia as refugees from Vietnam in the late 1970s and, as Buddhists, didn’t celebrate Christmas – until young children came along.So, our tree was fashioned out of cardboard tubes – the kind that hold bolts of fabric, since our family was in the textiles business. The base was a plastic bucket; the body was three of those slender cardboard cylinders, tipi-ed together and tied at the top. We draped it in tinsel and crowned it with a star.

Here’s how she became 2024’s most in-demand mammalIt’s been a rough year and we all craved solace. Thankfully, the universe provided in the moist, ungovernable form of a baby pygmy hippo. To the uninformed, here is a brief primer on 2024’s hottest It-mammal.On 10 July 2024, a female pygmy hippo was born at the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand, to mother Jona and father Tony. The zoo launched a public poll to choose a name for the infant. There were three meat-themed names to choose from: Moo Deng (bouncy pork), Moo Sap (minced pork) and Moo Daeng (red pork). Moo Deng won with 20,000 votes and soon captured the world’s imagination. Photographs of the infant – a slippery, chaotic and yes, bouncy beast shaped like a large potato, with a rolling eye, frequently open mouth and seemingly strong opinions – brought wonder to a jaded world.

Lizzie Vereker – the self-effacing erotica author, bullied by her husband – is supposed to be plain in the original text, but is played by the luminous Katherine Parkinson. Freddie – the rich but never greedy entrepreneur, bullied by his wife – is meant to be past his best, but is played with low-key, knowing magnetism by Danny Dyer. They are absolute dynamite together as they fall in love: sweet and romantic but also really hot, the living definition of screen chemistry.“It doesn’t have to be romantic chemistry,” says Parkinson, speaking to me from her home in London. “It’s just when you’re with an actor who’s similarly open, really up for the thrill of the ride. It’s thrilling when you’re in flow together. I’ve had anti-chemistry, too, and it’s been awful.” It’s especially peculiar when you’ve read Jilly Cooper’s book a load of times, and you know the A-couple is meant to be Rupert Campbell-Black (Alex Hassell) and Taggie O’Hara (Bella Maclean).
