The 25-year-old’s unit was supposed to sweep for landmines and unexploded ordnance among the olive groves in the aftermath of the opposition’s stunning 12-day rout of Bashar al-Assad and his Russian, Iranian and Lebanese allies.

Instead, she hit the brick wall that is still standard in many schools. “I was offered the option to come back full-time, which would have meant doing the same long hours I was before – or nothing.” With great regret, she felt she had to choose the latter, leaving what she describes as “an amazing 15-year teaching career” and a job she loved and was good at.

Then on the day, something shiftedFind more stories from The moment I knew series hereIn 2003 I was 17 years old and working in a 24-hour restaurant in the middle of Brisbane. I was a first-year art student who took herself far too seriously to become embroiled in a passionate love affair with a 19-year-old bartender with gelled-back hair who wore pointy white leather shoes and a big gold chain over his muscle tee. Or so I thought.I had notions of becoming some incredible artist in a creative power couple and Ivor completely slid beneath my defences because that wasn’t what he was about at all. Instead, he had this amazing capacity to make me laugh, we could talk for hours with no awkward pauses and I never felt as if I had to show up as someone cool, edgy or artistic. I could be exactly as who I was – which at that point was probably a pretty superficial, horrible person – but he seemed to adore me regardless. Looking back, it allowed me to put down the facade and relax into who I was. Continue reading...","Sat, 21 Dec 2024 19:00:24 GMT",0.0,0.9641
The Guardian,"Click, clic … boom! How secondhand clothes shopping turned very sour","Apps like Depop and Vinted are hugely popular, but an online culture of scams, rage and suspicion is now the default between buyers and sellers, with communications quickly descending into hurling abuse at a strangerHere is a real-life conversation on a secondhand shopping app: a buyer of two items asks if a seller could combine postage costs. The petulant seller refuses. After a grating plea from the buyer, the seller retorts, “Fine, I’ll refund you, but I’m doing it my way.” Eventually, the buyer receives a large piece of card with a load of grubby coppers stuck to it with Sellotape. On the back it says, “Enjoy the refund!”And there’s nothing odd about this – these sorts of exchanges between Brits on marketplace apps are so commonplace they have become part of the texture of the shopping experience. Maybe even part of the fun. But why do we communicate like this? What is happening that we can’t be remotely polite and normal? Where have our famous manners gone?

The Guardian,Ouch! Solving the riddle of pain,"We all know what hurts, but why is it so difficult to describe? Emma Cook meets the neurologists attempting to solve one of medicine’s most enduring issues and what it means for patients – and hears from a woman who has never felt painDeep in the basement of Oxford’s Institute of Biomedical Engineering, I am sitting in a pain laboratory trying to describe a series of small but exquisitely sharp electrical shocks emanating from an electrode attached to my index finger. It is proving to be something of a challenge. “Yeah, no, that’s really, er, unpleasant,” I offer, inarticulately, as the electric shocks slowly ramp up, their intensity putting me in mind of an excruciating jellyfish sting last summer.“Ow, that really hurts,” I manage. Up goes the volume. “And this?” Language escapes me and I emit a small reflexive cry instead. Dr Ben Seymour, a professor of clinical neuroscience and honorary consultant neurologist at Oxford University who has designed these tests, looks rather pleased. We are working our way briskly through a varied menu of different aches and pains, some heated, some chilled. The electric shock to the finger is the equivalent of an injury signal, a short sharp warning pain to alert us to danger. “It’s the ‘ow’ one,” explains Seymour. “I call it the wasp as it has a kind of angriness to it.” Continue reading...","Sun, 22 Dec 2024 00:05:31 GMT",-0.2942,-0.9933

The reaction is wildly appreciative, if not quite the one that once met this former teenybopper idol at the screaming height of Beatlemania. “That is the biggest wardrobe change of the evening,” he quips. (Swapping his Höfner bass for an electric guitar several times doesn’t count.)Welcome, then, to the eras tour – no, not that one, another one; one where costume changes are in inverse proportion to the number of lifetimes and cultural disruptions it spans. The McCartney timeline goes deep; inextricable from world events.

The Guardian,Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl review – the Aardman duo’s return is an absolute delight,"Almost 20 years since their last outing, the cheese-loving inventor and his ever-dependable dog resume battle with a feathered fiend in this precision-tooled caperAfter last year’s slightly lacklustre Chicken Run sequel, Dawn of the Nugget, it seemed as though Aardman’s hitherto peerless standards might be slipping a tad. But those fears, I am happy to report, were unfounded. The latest feature from the Bristol-based animation studio is an absolute delight. Directed by Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham, Vengeance Most Fowl – featuring crackpot inventor Wallace (Ben Whitehead) and his long-suffering canine chum, Gromit – revisits the tried-and-tested Aardman formula: affable absurdity combined with precision-tooled comic timing and a selection of deliciously silly jokes about cheese.It’s just shy of 20 years since Wallace and Gromit’s last feature film outing, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, but the world they inhabit is as cosily familiar as Wallace’s green knitted tank top. No task is too menial or simple to be massively overcomplicated by one of his technological innovations, while the faithful Gromit serves up tea, crumpets and exasperated eye-rolls.

Atlético Madrid had suffered, they had resisted and, in truth, they had probably longed for that final whistle to go, and then suddenly Alexander Sørloth thumped in another late winner. In doing so he sent Atlético Madrid top the table at Christmas and their coach, staff and subs sprinting on to the pitch.Barcelona’s fans, meanwhile, turned and headed straight for the exit, unable to believe what had just happened. What had happened was this: on a night when they had hit the bar and had more than enough chances to win it, including deep into added time, in which Jan Oblak, the goalkeeper had been the best player on the pitch, with Pedri, they had somehow been beaten. It is the third time in a row that they have lost here in La Liga and the first time they have ever fallen at the hands of a Diego Simeone-led Atlético team and it hurt.

The Guardian,Obstinate Ange Postecoglou must find consistency at Spurs or a crunch will come | Jonathan Wilson,"Doubts are growing around the Tottenham manager and his all-or-nothing team’s lack of a plan B will be tested by LiverpoolAlmost a season and a half has passed since Ange Postecoglou was appointed Tottenham manager and that means he is entering dangerous territory. He has led Spurs in 65 games. Antonio Conte got 77, André Villas-Boas 80 and José Mourinho 86. Until Thursday’s chaotic Carabao Cup win over Manchester United, he had a lower win percentage than all three, but he has now snuck past Mourinho. Sooner or later simply being not as grumpy as the bloke who came before is not going to be enough.Since Postecoglou took 26 points from his first 10 Premier League games, that statistical quirk is particularly troublesome. There is little sense of him slowly dragging the club in the right direction, of the trend being to the better. Rather, since those first 10 games, he is averaging 1.43 points per Premier League game – enough to finish ninth or 10th most seasons. Does the fact the football is exciting – something that couldn’t be said under his three permanent predecessors – make up for what, given resources and stadium, would be a significant underachievement?

In north London in September last year, the winger thought he had given Liverpool the lead, only for the assistant to flag incorrectly for offside before the video assistant referee failed to overturn the mistake through incompetent communication in a match Liverpool went on to lose 2-1.The officials made the headlines that day but Díaz has taken plenty of the limelight since. With a competitive cohort, Arne Slot has shown faith in Díaz, starting the Colombian in key fixtures with Manchester City, Arsenal, Manchester United and Aston Villa to help Liverpool reach the top of the table and ensure they fear no one.

Another two goals for Gabriel Jesus – his first in the Premier League since January – followed up his match-winning performance against the same opponents a few days ago as Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli and the substitute Declan Rice with his first league goal of the season rounded off another ­victory over Crystal Palace.Only the sight of Bukayo Saka limping off during the first half with a suspected hamstring injury could dampen the enthusiasm of the travelling fans, whose side have scored five or more goals in six away games in all competitions in 2024 – the most ever by an English top-flight club in a calendar year. More importantly, they are now only three points behind the leaders, Liverpool – albeit having played two games more. But with Manchester City six points behind Arsenal and almost a speck of dust in their rear-view mirror, Arteta will know they have never had a better chance to go all the way after clinically ­dispatching Oliver Glasner’s side.

With luck you’ll be out of here and home before the roads get too busy. That man behind the counter doesn’t look happy; who cares: as long as he’s efficient.That’d be me. I’ve been standing in one spot for the last six hours (OK, one toilet break) and have another three to go. I’ve worked in retail for 14 years, and so far today I’ve dealt with 200 customers. I’ve smiled 200 times, but that’s getting harder. I’m so tired it probably looks more like a grimace. Sorry, but consider me a checkout robot, carefully rationing my battery charge by using muscle memory to hit the right keys and move the mouse cursor to make sure each of today’s 500 or so products (so far) is correctly entered and paid for.

The Guardian,What if Russia wins in Ukraine? We can already see the shadows of a dark 2025 | Timothy Garton Ash,"Instability is growing, Putin’s hybrid war in Europe is heating up and for fear of escalation we have encouraged global nuclear proliferationThere are human activities in which both sides can win. War is not one of them. Either Ukraine wins this war or Russia does. Ukraine’s former foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba says bluntly that unless the current trajectory is changed, “we will lose this war”.To be clear: this is still avoidable. Suppose the roughly four-fifths of Ukrainian territory still controlled by Kyiv gets military commitments from the west strong enough to deter any further Russian advances, secure large-scale investment in economic reconstruction, encourage Ukrainians to return from abroad to rebuild their country, and allow for stable, pro-European politics and reform. In five years, the country joins the EU, and then, under a new US administration, starts the process of entering Nato. Most of Ukraine becomes a sovereign, independent, free country, firmly anchored in the west.Timothy Garton Ash is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"Belief in a lottery curse is comforting, but winning lots of money does make you happy  | Martha Gill","The notion that vast windfalls inevitably bring misery is based on a handful of sad casesDoes winning the lottery wreck your life? When it was revealed earlier this week that an anonymous Briton had won £177m in the November EuroMillions draw – making them the third biggest national lottery winner ever – the Mail Online announced it with all the impartiality of a bad fairy at a christening: “Other big winners”, the second half of the headline ran, “have faced ‘lottery curse’ with&nbsp;divorce, disease, family splits and death”.Follow the progress of lottery winners through the newspapers, and you’d be forgiven for thinking they all live out the same morality tale.

The Guardian,"Some cinematic turkeys are so bad they achieve a kind of trascendence. Last Christmas, for one | Kathryn Bromwich","You can’t simply set out to create a so-bad-it’s-good classic. But this year’s thinly veiled Taylor Swift biopic, Christmas in the Spotlight, could be a contenderAs a lifelong enthusiast of the “so-bad-it’s-good” sub-strand of cinema, I approach every Christmas with a mix of excitement and trepidation. If at one end of the spectrum we have magical Christmas films (It’s a Wonderful Life, Home Alone, Jingle All the Way), passing through the slurry of mediocre, sentimental seasonal cash-ins, what I hope to find at the other extreme is something so truly awful it achieves a peculiar kind of transcendence.Some recent contenders were Last Christmas (a January resolution to eat more vegetables masquerading as a Christmas film; weird Brexit subplot; insufficient George Michael) and Cats (genuinely creepy, but giving way to a confusing, cumulative high as the film progresses, so that by the time Judi Dench says “a cat is not a dog” you have reached a sort of collective hysteria).

Great skill is needed for the apparently simple task of attaching suction cups to a cow’s teats – especially if she has painful warts.The cows hated me (rightly so) and I hated them.

The Guardian,The Observer view on the Church of England: how does it recover after its annus horribilis?,"A new Anglican leader must reinvent the role if they are to restore faith in an institution mired in sexual abuse scandals Next week churches, chapels and cathedrals across England will be celebrating Christmas in traditional style. Congregations doubled, the pews will be filled for perhaps the only time of the year, the chancels and naves glittering through the darkness with lights, baubles and good cheer. There will be all the old familiar carols, Christingle services and midnight masses, the plaster baby Jesus will be inserted into his crib, the brasswork will shine and, doubtless, waves of beer fumes will waft gently skywards as worshippers re-enact the hallowed, long-remembered rituals of the ancient, astonishing nativity story.This year, however, a sense of gloom fringes the traditionally joyous celebrations. It has been truly an annus horribilis for the Church of England, experiencing what some see as the gravest institutional crisis since its foundation by Henry VIII in 1534. In the past, it has survived schisms and rows, a civil war, the moral degradation of slavery, the 19th-century battle between biblical literalism and evolution, disputes over ritualism and, most recently, the divisions over the ordination and treatment of woman and gay people. Never before, however, has an archbishop of Canterbury been forced to resign, as Justin Welby was last month, with possibly more bishops to follow, and never has the church seemed so isolated from the society it seeks to serve.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Observer view on Labour’s plans to reform education | Observer editorial,"The government needs to go further on pay and workload if it is to retain high-quality teachers in schoolsGreat teaching is the most powerful lever schools have to improve children’s education, according to the Education Endowment Foundation. So, how the education system recruits, trains, retains and supports teachers is one of the most important questions for politicians and policymakers – far more so than the structural reforms Westminster and Whitehall too often obsess over.Yet schools in England have been facing a worsening teacher recruitment and retention crisis for over a decade, and pupil to teacher ratios have risen, particularly in secondary schools. Last year, the teaching workforce grew by fewer than 300 teachers. Too few teachers makes it harder for those in the profession to do their jobs well – further adding to workload and behaviour management pressures, and undermining retention even more. More than a million pupils are now in classes of more than 30. Shortages of teachers in several important specialist subjects at secondary school, including physics, computing and foreign languages mean that teachers without a relevant qualification are having to teach them, and some schools are having to limit subject provision.

Plus letters from Ruth Holt and Jenny FroudeAs a deaf researcher focused on language deprivation among deaf individuals, I am often asked about cochlear implants and their role in the lives of deaf children (The cochlear question: as the parent of a deaf baby, should I give her an implant to help her hear?, 11 December). While cochlear implants are a technological tool that provides access to sound, the critical issue is not the implant itself, but the decision to exclude signed languages from a deaf child’s upbringing.Language is a fundamental human right and the foundation of cognitive, social and emotional development. For deaf children, access to a visual language – such as American Sign Language or British Sign Language (BSL) – is essential, particularly in the early years when the brain is most receptive to language acquisition. Without this access, many deaf children can face significant delays in language development, which leads to lifelong challenges in education, employment and mental health.

The Guardian,The joy of trivia: ‘We wrote our book together to intrigue each other’,"After midlife burnout came a rediscovered curiosity for two friends and writersIt was the early 2000s, we were in our 20s and had both started as assistants at the same company. We bonded over excruciating induction sessions, where we had to reveal things like which cartoon character we most identified with (B: Danger Mouse; E: Marcie from Peanuts). We laughed a lot, but we also worked really hard – and pushed each other to do new things. Twenty years later, with six children between us as well as more senior jobs, we found ourselves bogged down by endless to-lists and the relentless pace of midlife. We realised we needed to rediscover and connect to the positives in the world around us. The answer lay in sparking each other’s curiosity.Many studies have shown that having a curious mindset has real-life benefits, both for our bodies and our souls. Our brains have evolved to release dopamine when we discover new things, and dopamine boosts memory, creativity and forges new neural connections. Other research shows that having a driving sense of curiosity can break down barriers between people – particularly important in our increasingly polarised world – c uriosity helps us to build empathy, connectivity and respect for others.

The Guardian,Trend watch: cosy loungewear,"With all the planning, shopping and socialising, don’t forget to schedule some much needed R&amp;R this holiday season. Here’s our pick of the best comfy attire to relax inIt’s officially the time of year to get cosy; think tactile fabrics that inspire a relaxed atmosphere. Forget itchy sequins and Christmas jumpers and pull on a look whose only criterion is to offer a sartorial hug. It might be your favourite well-worn PJs or joggers with a new pair of socks, or a gifted piece of elevated loungewear for the festive in-between bit (when declining social engagements isn’t just OK but is actively encouraged).Choose ultra-soft knits and cashmere blends for a relaxing curled-up day on the sofa. The White Company (above) excels at this brief, as do newcomers and B Corp certified Rise and Fall (3, below). Reliably, Marks &amp; Spencer Autograph cashmere rollneck (£95) works at home with leggings, or can be a sweater- shaped comfort blanket out and about with jeans, or even dressed up with tailored trousers to the office after the holidays. Socks are a key component to achieve maximum lounging comfort so, hopefully, the bearded guy in red brings you a new pair, but should you want to treat yourself, a pair of cashmere bedsocks are the ultimate for indoor lounging. Try pairs-scotland.com’s lambswool bedsocks (£20) or Base Ranges’s organic cotton beauties (5, below). Top tip: cashmere socks wear terribly on the heel if you put on with shoes, but will give a Christmas stocking a run for its money in longevity if reserved for use with slippers only.

The Guardian,Making an entrance: the experts share design ideas for your hallway,"It is often a neglected space but the hallway is the backbone of any property and can set the mood for the whole homeOf all the rooms in the home, the hallway is arguably the most neglected. There are several reasons for this, but top of the list is that many people scoff at the very idea that a hallway is a room in its own right. Often it is seen as little more than a necessary linking corridor, one that invariably doubles as a dumping ground for coats, shoes, unopened post and the other detritus of everyday life. But any design expert will insist that a room it most certainly is and it deserves as much thought as any other – particularly since it gives the first impression of your home. ​​“Hallways are the backbone of any property and can really set the mood for the whole home,” explains interior designer Pandora Taylor. “People struggle to understand the identity of their hallway, because it doesn’t have an obvious purpose, like a dining room, where you might create a vibe for entertaining in the evening, or a kitchen which you might like bright and practical for cooking. But what mood do you want to set in a hallway? That’s a question people get stuck on.”” Continue reading...","Sat, 21 Dec 2024 16:00:20 GMT",0.296,0.8047

No cars dare use the wide boulevard any more because the road is still watched by Kurdish snipers allied to the regime. The units retreated into the warren of bombed and burnt-out buildings when Islamist rebel groups launched an unprecedented attack on the city at the end of November, triggering a chain reaction that led to the swift collapse of the Assad dynasty.Civilians hurry past, some with small children in pushchairs, others rolling cooking gas canisters down the road, all trying not to attract undue attention. A man had been shot and killed here the night before, picked off from the upper floor of a windowless apartment block. Aleppo fell to an umbrella of Sunni Arab factions led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) three weeks ago, but the Kurdish units stationed in Sheikh Maqsoud refused to surrender when HTS came in, afraid of what would happen if they did.

Clearer in the film’s more universal right-people-wrong-time romance but also in the more specific, and knottier, queerness. It was a rare, giddy uplift to see young gay men fall headfirst for each other with such believable and unfettered intimacy but their affection existed in a world full of caveats – where to kiss, how to act, who to be – and it was only in privacy that they could really be themselves. “When I’m at home I’m absolutely fine,” Tom Cullen’s Russell says. “I’m happy being gay … It’s when I go outside …”Twelve years later in All of Us Strangers, Haigh’s first film about gay characters since, what lies outside has dramatically changed. Same-sex marriage has been legalised. Gay culture at large has been more widely embraced, from Heartstopper to Queer Eye to Drag Race. It has, allegedly, got better. But for Andrew Scott’s lonely gay writer, Adam, things remain troubled on the inside, a fix to the political not enough to mend the personal, living like Cullen’s Weekend protagonist before him, in a high-rise far away from everyone and everything else. This time it’s not just on the edge of a city but on the edge of the world, eerily close to that of another, on the precipice between the living and the dead.

Kelly chained himself to London buses in the 1990s to protest over a lack of access to transport, but has watched the right to an independent life be steadily eroded. He worries that yet more cuts to services are on their way Continue reading...","Tue, 10 Dec 2024 10:31:41 GMT",-0.7579,-0.8604

The Guardian,On a wing and a prayer: the hidden beauty of insect’s flight – in pictures,"For the past decade, the Barcelona-based visual artist Xavi Bou has devoted his work to revealing “the hidden beauty of natural movement”. His initial focus was birds; now he’s moved on to insects. In collaboration with US entomologist Adrian Smith he’s created an eye-popping series that captures – by merging multiple frames into a single image – the rhythmic flutterings of butterflies and chaotic leaps of spittlebugs and treehoppers.
