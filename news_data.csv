But Friday’s speech by JD Vance, the US vice-president, has the potential to be the most consequential – the moment the world order against which Putin railed fell apart.Sometimes, even in this digital age, speeches can act as clarifiers. Yes, the 22 minutes were full of laughable hypocrisy, distorted portraits of European democracy and insensitivity to Europe’s trauma with fascism, but for what it said about the chasm in values between most in Europe and the Trump administration, it was hard to overlook.

The Guardian,Ash Sarkar: ‘I never learned much of value from TV’,"The leftwing political commentator on gen Z’s disillusionment with democracy, why she’s a ‘Mantel stan’ and the moral panic behind her first bookAsh Sarkar, 32, is a journalist and political commentator. She grew up in north London and is a contributing editor at the leftwing website Novara Media. A regular pundit on TV and radio, she made waves with a viral 2018 appearance on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, where she clashed with Piers Morgan, telling him: “I’m literally a communist, you idiot.” Her first book, Minority Rule: Adventures in the Culture War (Bloomsbury), is a lively analysis of how the ruling classes purposefully misdirect political blame by stoking the fear that minorities are working to oppress the majority.What does “minority rule” mean to you?I realised that every moral panic – whether it was trans rights, BLM [Black Lives Matter], Extinction Rebellion – was 1,000 doors opening on to the same place. The story was: here are these minorities who want to tell you how to live. But at the same time, I believe society is governed by minority rule – oligarchic power, corporate power, the way in which electoral systems devalue the votes of people who live in densely populated areas. So minority rule describes both this moral panic and the true state of affairs. Continue reading...","Sat, 15 Feb 2025 18:00:43 GMT",0.34,-0.7269

The Guardian,Dreams review – Jessica Chastain channels rich Americans whose charity comes with strings,"The erotic reward for Chastain’s sponsorship of a Mexican dancer lights a fuse that reveals philanthropy’s toxic undersideMexican director Michel Franco returns with a chilly, angrily intense and deeply pessimistic tale of erotic obsession among the liberal super-rich in Trump’s US who seek to launder and redeem their guilt by sponsoring the arts. It’s a really involving picture which beckons you hypnotically towards the tacit promise of a sensationally unhappy and violent denouement, and of course Franco is unlikely to deliver any other kind. The two final plot developments are shocking, if not precisely surprising, and in fact vulnerable to the charge of being crudely obvious – but Franco certainly gives us a gripping emotional drama, supercharged with toxic sensuality and fear.Jessica Chastain plays Jennifer McCarthy, a wealthy woman based in San Francisco extensively accustomed to high-end restaurants, couture, private planes and chauffeur-driven SUVs and Franco has an eye for the luxury-porn scenarios familiar from TV dramas such as Succession and The White Lotus, though with a more dyspeptic and fearful edge.

For Jannik Sinner, the three-month ban he has accepted from the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) is less than he might have received had he let the appeal go the natural distance. While he will miss almost nothing of note, at least in terms of grand slams, since the world No 1 will be free to return in early May, ready for the French Open and a shot at a third successive major title and fourth in total.For Wada, Sinner’s partial admission of responsibility holds up a key part of the anti-doping programme: that an individual is responsible for what goes in their body, a responsibility that extends to their entourage. And for the sporting world at large, it’s something of a rebuttal to those who say the superstars get preferential treatment. Continue reading...","Sat, 15 Feb 2025 20:00:46 GMT",-0.4497,0.8705

For 80 minutes it seemed fears of being blunt in attack would be founded in a frustrating stalemate at struggling Leicester but then the excellent Ethan Nwaneri dinked a feathery cross into the box and the substitute Mikel Merino, unmarked between Wout Faes and Woyo Coulibaly six yards out, twisted his head to power in the first of his two goals. Merino, who replaced the ineffective Raheem Sterling, sealed victory with his second with three minutes of normal time to play.Arteta began with Leandro Trossard as a false 9, Sterling to his left and Nwaneri to his right in a three-pronged attack but until Merino’s header the Arsenal manager must have been wondering how else to penetrate Leicester, now without a clean sheet in 21 matches in all competitions. This was the first Premier League game in which Arsenal began without any of Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus or Havertz, who is out for the season with a hamstring injury, for almost four years. But Merino ensured Arsenal cut the gap to Liverpool, the leaders who host Wolves on Sunday, to four points for at least 24 hours. Continue reading...","Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:32:42 GMT",-0.0772,-0.9523

Levy’s vision was of a steady-state league, with no mobility and therefore no real jeopardy, where the same teams competed for the same stuff every season. How we laughed. As it turned out, he needn’t have gone to the trouble. It pretty much ended up happening anyway.For Tottenham at least, a season that began replete with possibility has buffed down to a blunt point.

The Guardian,Trump’s betrayal of Ukraine has emboldened Putin and pulled the rug from under Nato allies  | Simon Tisdall,"The ramifications of the president’s appeasement of Russia will be felt widely, not least in the alliance he recklessly underminedIn Graham Greene’s 1955 novel, The Quiet American, Alden Pyle, a CIA agent, reckons he has all the answers to conflict in colonial era Vietnam. Pyle’s ignorance, arrogance and dangerous scheming, intended to bring peace, result instead in the deaths of many innocents and ultimately his own. In today’s too-real, nonfiction world, Donald Trump is Pyle. Except he’s The Noisy American.He thinks he’s a great deal-maker. He&nbsp;never stops trumpeting his brilliance. Yet his North Korea “deal of the century” was a fiasco. He handed Afghanistan to the Taliban on a plate. Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu runs rings around him. Now Trump-Pyle proposes another rubbish deal – selling out Ukraine. America’s very own surrender monkey is Vladimir Putin’s useful&nbsp;idiot. No matter how officials spin it, Trump’s concessions, made before ceasefire talks with Russia even begin, are calamitous, primarily for Ukraine but also for Europe’s security, the transatlantic alliance, and other vulnerable targets, such as Taiwan. As stated, Trump’s giveaways – accepting the loss of sovereign Ukrainian territory to Russian aggression, denying Nato membership to Kyiv, withholding US security guarantees and troops – are shameful appeasement, amounting to betrayal.

Do you remember when that was a major talking point in certain quarters? Prominent columnists wrote endless pieces declaring that the word “women” had “become verboten”.

The Guardian,Our inhumane jails are promoting a vicious cycle that is criminal in itself  | Martha Gill,"A medieval system is oiling the revolving door for reoffenders and seeing prison staff leave in drovesBritish jails are now so bad that other countries are refusing to extradite criminals here on the grounds it would be “inhumane”. That may still come as a bit of a shock for a nation that, despite everything, has an entrenched habit of considering itself the gold&nbsp;standard.But of course we are not, at least when it comes to prisons. Here are just a few more details from a recent report that compiled testimonies from officers: rooms flooded with “the smell of urine from rodents”; broken CCTV cameras; floors breaking down into trip hazards; “ongoing legionella issues”; kitchens with no heating for eight years; a jail that has been without hot water since April 2022. Things have got so bad that some prisons are commissioning inmates to do the repairs themselves.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"If the AI Roundheads go to war with tech royalty, don’t bet against them | John Naughton","Silicon Valley wants to spend a fortune on the fantasy of human-level intelligence. But there are more practical and valuable things to achieveThere’s a moment in the 1967 film The Graduate that has become renowned. At a party thrown by his parents to celebrate his graduation, Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) is approached by Mr McGuire, an elderly bore who wants to say “just one word” to him: “plastics”. “Exactly how do you mean?”, asks the hapless Ben. “There’s a great future in plastics,” says McGuire. “Think about it.”Listening last week to the spending plans of the techlords who run Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta leads one to wonder if something analogous might have happened to them on their graduation nights.

The Guardian,Cat person or dog person? It’s which animal we loathe that matters in the end | Andrew Anthony,"A councillor’s alleged attempt to blow up a bird-prowling moggie reveals the pet-loving divide runs deep The resignation last week of James Garnor, a parish councillor in Whittlebury, Northamptonshire, may look like further proof of the maxim, established by the infamous Jackie Weaver lockdown meeting, that low-level politics produce high-level emotions. However, the cause of his undoing was nothing as trivial as democratic principles; it illustrates a far more profound question that, sooner or later, we all confront: are you a cat or a dog person?Garnor, we may safely conclude, is not a cat person. He quit following allegations that he rigged up a bird table with a firework device so that it exploded when a cat paid a visit. The consequences of this shocking but non-lethal incident, which took place back in 2023, have only now come to a head, but it’s fair to say that, as anti-cat statements go, a remote-detonated IED is at the extreme end of things.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Let’s opt instead for opennessThey say we don’t like drugs, sex, democracy or DIY. Here’s how gen Z really feelAfter years of being told that the progressive attitudes of younger generations would “save us” and take us towards a utopian future, we are rapidly learning that the politics of gen Z – today’s 13- to&nbsp;27-year-olds – are something more fractured, with just as many young people carrying rightwing views as leftwing ones (and, on ­certain issues, even more).This reality has become starker in recent days in the wake of many surveys uncovering “shocking” new findings about gen Z’s political attitudes. A Mail on Sunday survey published two weeks ago found that more than two-thirds of the 18- to 27-year-olds questioned supported chemical castration for sex offenders – and just under half supported bringing back the death penalty.

The Guardian,The Observer view: Change to UK citizenship rule is cruel and misjudged | Observer editorial,"The government’s attempt to court Reform voters by penalising asylum seekers who arrive by the wrong route could backfireLast Monday, the government quietly added a few short lines to Home Office guidance that amount to a huge change in refugee policy. By amending the “good character” guidance for immigration staff processing asylum applications, ministers have effectively removed the right of refugees to apply for British citizenship if they arrived in the UK illegally or via a dangerous route, such as in a small boat or stowed away in a lorry.This cruel change means that refugees fleeing conflict, torture and human rights abuses, and who have long been granted protection and the right to live and work in the UK, will no longer be able to become British citizens. There is no justification for it. Although the government has said that the home secretary retains the discretion to grant citizenship on an exceptional basis, that is likely to be highly unusual. While immigration caseworkers have the discretion to disregard illegal entry for refugees who arrived in the UK as children, there is far from any guarantee that this will happen, and, given the high citizenship application fee, this measure will ensure that even child refugees are penalised as adults for their method of arrival. The immigration lawyer Colin Yeo has said these changes amount to a contravention of the 1951 Refugee Convention, to which Britain was a founding signatory.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on supporting vaccines: humans can work miracles – so why wouldn’t we? | Editorial,"Global immunisation programmes are under risk as the US slashes its aid programme and the UK considers cutting fundingIt is easy to become so used to scientific and social advances that we take them for granted. But sometimes we should pause to celebrate – to feel genuine awe – at the wonders that we have seen. Amid&nbsp;all the wars, the disasters and the crimes of the&nbsp;last half century, we have witnessed nothing short&nbsp;of a miracle.Vaccination, in addition to clean water, sanitation and improved nutrition, has been one of the greatest contributors to global health. It is responsible for much of the astounding fall in child mortality, which plummeted by 59% between 1990 and 2022. It has saved more than 150 million lives, mostly of infants, since the Expanded Programme on Immunisation was launched by the World Health Organization in 1974. Initially designed to protect children against diseases including smallpox, tuberculosis, polio and measles, the scheme has since been extended to cover more pathogens. Then, in 2000, came the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi), a public-private organisation&nbsp;that provides financial and technical support for vaccination in poorer countries and negotiates with manufacturers to lower costs.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus, letters from Andrew Robinson and Aideen CartyMuch as in the US, with the recent congressional hearings on unidentified anomalous phenomena, the UK government is apparently less than transparent in its handling of UAP sightings (formerly called UFOs) – as your article about the Calvine photo shows (What really happened in Calvine? The mystery behind the best UFO picture ever seen, G2, 11 February). And, as in the US, any hope for imminent and trustworthy disclosure about what these objects may be is probably futile.Those who do not a priori consider this topic ludicrous, or exploit it in a sensationalist manner, are increasingly taking a more nuanced and independent approach. If there are such phenomena, it stands to reason that they can and should be studied with the necessary rigour. Continue reading...","Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:23:24 GMT",-0.0772,0.8979
The Guardian,Fantasy fiction doesn’t need reclaiming for women – they already write and read it | Letters,"Responding to an editorial about the surge in romantasy books, James Latimer writes that romance isn’t only for girls, and Yvonne Williams talks about the synergy of dragons and sexI was disappointed to read your view on romantasy fiction (Editorial, 7 February), which seemed to imply that the fantasy genre needed reclaiming for women. This does a huge disservice to the many excellent female fantasy authors – some recent, some around for decades – who have been a mainstay of the genre despite not writing romance or teen fiction.These women do not seem to get the recognition, and readership, that they deserve – despite some, such as NK Jemisin, Ann Leckie, Charlie Jane Anders, RF Kuang or Martha Wells, dominating genre awards. These authors also have to fight the continual misperception that&nbsp;they&nbsp;only write romantic or young adult fiction, which is exactly the fantasy that your article perpetuates.

Now we need honesty and action from our leadersNot yet a quarter of the way into this century and global average temperatures are already 1.75C above the preindustrial average. January 2025 was the hottest on record and has also set a record for the highest yearly minimum global surface temperature, and likely the highest minimum in the past 120,000 years. It is part of a clear pattern. Last year’s global average was 1.6C above the preindustrial – a sobering reality check, given that, only three months ago at the UN Cop29 summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, leaders were still declaring that limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C was within reach.We are firmly in the post-climate change world now, and the serious implications of this demand honest acknowledgment.

Adapted by Bong from Edward Ashton’s novel Mickey7, it stars Robert Pattinson as a bio-clone menial worker of the future condemned to eternal life, or eternal death, by being repeatedly killed in the service of a space exploration corporation doing fatally dangerous jobs and then&nbsp;reincarnated.It’s a broad-brush futurist satire on the theme of Elon Musk-type tech bros who say that whining about the environment is for libtards because we’re all shooting off for space really soon, where there have to be viable planets somewhere, and any current alien inhabitants are expendable – as indeed are the working humans who are getting us out to new worlds.

The country’s tourism industry is getting ready for a boostGeeratiya Aunjarorn, like many ­people in Thailand, didn’t know much about The White Lotus, the series that has gripped audiences in the US and UK, until early last year. But when it was announced that ­season three would not only be filmed in her country, but would also ­feature one of Thailand’s most famous pop stars, Lalisa Manobal – better known ­simply as Lisa – Geeratiya and legions of other fans have followed the ­filming closely.Over the past year, photos of the crew filming on the tourist islands of Phuket and Samui have gone viral across Lisa fan pages, and hashtags speculated on the kind of character the singer, from the K pop group Blackpink, might play. A premiere was held in Bangkok on Friday night and ­season three will be released on Sunday in the US and on Mondaytomorrow in&nbsp;the&nbsp;UK.

The Guardian,"Lady Gaga, Will Ferrell and Lauryn Hill headline star-studded SNL concert","A host of Saturday Night Live cast members and music stars hit New York on Valentine’s Day for a mammoth 50th anniversary concertIt seems like a daunting task, to sum up 50 years of music in one night. But when you harbor its cultural cachet, the respect artists have for Saturday Night Live and its stunningly expansive rolodex, as well as the sheer production power of both SNL honcho Lorne Michaels and producer Mark Ronson, the result is a three-hour-plus extravaganza to rival even the starriest, most packed Grammys, Oscars or its ilk.Amid New York’s bitter chill on Valentine’s night, the event took place at Radio City Music Hall, a perfect home considering its Rockefeller Center confines are only a hop, skip and a jump from SNL’s Studio 8H at nearby NBC Studios. Its art deco space serves as the epitome of New York City: a tourist mecca beloved by hardscrabble locals. So it seemed natural that the Rockettes and SNL would both have graced its hallowed stage at one time. Continue reading...","Sat, 15 Feb 2025 16:11:55 GMT",0.0,0.9654
The Guardian,Cate Blanchett: ‘I think you can smell when something is cynical’,"The actor is teaming up with old friend Thomas Ostermeier for a bold new take on Chekhov. The pair discuss censorship, risk-taking, the far right, and ask: are celeb-led plays ruining the West End?The first time Cate Blanchett was cast in The Seagull, she was in Sydney and in her 20s, a young stage actor playing the part of another young stage actor who was desperate for fame and dizzyingly in love. It was 1997, at Belvoir St theatre, and Blanchett was very much in love herself, having recently got together with the writer-director Andrew Upton, who she would marry later that year. Though the part of Nina in Anton Chekhov’s drama involved far more heartbreak – the character is left emotionally wrecked after being dropped by her lover – and Blanchett remembers “I’d just met Andrew and was madly in love and thought: ‘How am I going to go out every night and be broken open when I’m so deeply happy?’”She clearly pulled it off: among those who saw her in the Australian director Neil Armfield’s production was the director Jane Campion, who reportedly thought Blanchett’s portrayal so “utterly perfect and true” that she wished Chekhov had been there to see it. If the audience fell in love with Blanchett then, she in turn fell in love – with Chekhov’s play: “It’s so fuelled by perplexed, dissatisfied, annoyed people who do really strange things, but in Chekhov those people really are anchored by love,” she says today.

The Guardian,Memoir of a Snail review – Adam Elliot’s stop-motion animation is brilliantly bleak,"In this Oscar-nominated tragicomedy, Sarah Snook is the voice of a loner whose relentless misfortune is tempered only by a bond with her pet snailsMention stop-motion animation and the first thing that comes to mind is likely to be the amiable claymation creations of Bristol’s Aardman studio. But in fact, perhaps more than any other form of animation, stop-motion is a medium that lends itself to darker, more violent themes: the macabre sentient tendrils of Jan Svankmajer’s Little Otik; the haunted gothic fairytales dreamed up in the imagination of Tim Burton; the chilling pre-teen horror of Coraline. Add to this list the singular vision of Australian stop-motion animator Adam Elliot (Mary and Max; the Oscar-winning short Harvie Krumpet), whose tragicomic tales of loneliness, eccentricity and outsider status are told in a glum colour palette that evokes black mould, peeling wallpaper and crushed dreams.Elliot’s latest, the multi-award-winning, Oscar-nominated Memoir of a Snail, is the sorry tale of a melancholic woman named Grace Pudel, voiced with world-weary resignation by Succession’s Sarah Snook. It’s a catalogue of misfortune: Grace’s mother dies in childbirth; she and her twin brother, Gilbert (Kodi Smit-McPhee), are orphaned when their depressive, alcoholic father succumbs to his sleep apnoea. And then things get really bad. Grace, like the pet snails she counts among her closest friends, just wants to crawl into her shell and hide from the world.In UK and Irish cinemas Continue reading...","Sat, 15 Feb 2025 15:00:41 GMT",0.6124,-0.9782

A wetsuit may seem the obvious choice for winter swimming, but many open-water wetsuits won’t offer much warmth in water below 10C, and the effort of putting one on at this time of year when swims are short often isn’t worth it (see more detail below). But is a cold-water swimsuit any different from a standard suit, and are they worth buying? I tested seven of the best to find out.Best overall cold-water swimsuit:

The Guardian,"It’s time to rethink boredom, procrastination and regret","That’s the way to fulfil your goals and have fun in lifeWe all procrastinate, but most conventional advice for conquering it doesn’t work, at least not for me, beyond chores like cleaning the kitchen or going to the gym or getting my tax return in on time. It certainly doesn’t work for the kind of procrastination that has obstructed my best life: swerving that relationship I craved; postponing for years a book on the philosophy of love that I yearned to write before finally putting pen to paper; failing to pursue the hobby – piano playing – to which I’ve been devoted since childhood, while my piano sat in a corner, closed and silent.It’s no use being told by self-help books to formulate my top priorities when I already have core goals that define who I am or want to become. Or to be urged to break up tasks into bite-sized steps, with a deadline for each step, because how does that work when it’s a relationship or a vocation that I’m avoiding? Conventional advice says I should forgive myself my paralysis rather than beating myself up about it but, soothing as this is, it doesn’t magically give me either the focus or the energy I need to fulfil those prized goals. I can remove external distractions, especially online access, but what am I to do about distractions inside my head: fantasising, say, about a holiday or a romance as an escape from the task in hand?

Robson was handsome, ambitious, and determined to do well by his family. The job was an attractive opportunity: after years working on vessels, and as a pipelayer, he was pursuing safer and more lucrative positions piloting the remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) that are used to monitor underwater structures. It was a long stint away, but at least he’d be back to enjoy Christmas in South Tyneside with his partner, Kristie Graham, 39, her daughter Willow, 10, and Sefa, their 17-month-old son, in the new house they’d just bought.Until then, his home would be the Seafox Burj, a three-legged jack-up rig planted in the shallow waters of the Al-Shaheen oil field, 80km from land. Robson hated being away, but stayed connected to Graham and his friends over WhatsApp. From his vantage point in the middle of the Gulf, he’d take photos of dramatic sunsets and send them to Graham. It was a window into the strange world of offshore workers and a sign, for her, of the way he could always find the positive in any situation.
