The results of a study commissioned by Channel 4 this week found that 52% of gen Z, who are aged between 13 and 27, thought “the UK would be a better place if a strong leader was in charge who does not have to bother with parliament and elections”.That feels … not great. And, of course, the reflexive tendency for many older generations is to resort immediately to ridicule of gen Z. You know the sort of thing. Oh, I guess they got bored halfway through the video summary of whichever dictator’s life, and just scrolled to the next thing. Or: this is why they have to put those captions on clips saying, “What happens at the end will blow your mind!!!!!” Short shrift would no doubt also be given to the finding that 33% of gen Z think the UK would be better off “if the army was in charge”.

Over the past two weekends, Hamas has handed over seven Israeli hostages in exchange for the release of nearly 300 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, and preparations are already under way for a double exchange next weekend. But it hasn’t been without hitches.Two days in, Israeli soldiers opened fire on Palestinian civilians as they sought to return to their homes near Gaza’s southern border, killing a child. This weekend, Hamas opted to release only soldiers, despite having agreed to first release all remaining civilian women and children. Israeli forces then delayed the return of hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza, while Hamas dragged its feet on informing Israel how many of the remaining hostages to be exchanged were alive or dead.

The OpenAI chief executive remembered to add that his firm would be launching “better models” soon, but his praise for DeepSeek’s R1 version would seem to clear up one question for AI luddites: Is the Chinese product as good as the pundits are saying? Answer: if Altman is saying so, yes, it probably is.Other mysteries remain, of course. Has DeepSeek really developed the thing on the comical shoestring budget of $6m? Or is the model running on Nvidia chips, just using fewer of them and of the older variety? If so, could it be good news for Nvidia in the long run that the AI game has new entrants?

Yet NHS assessors think it’s fine to leave her alone for hours at a timeLast September, I received an email from a reader called Rosy. At just 53, motor neurone disease meant Rosy was losing her body as she knew it, piece by piece. Previously an assistant librarian at the University of Portsmouth, she was now struggling to hold a book. Too weak to breathe easily, she was reliant on a ventilator at night. In the two-bedroom house Rosy shared with her teenage daughter and cat, she was living out of her front room: a hospital-style bed and commode squashed in next to the television.You don’t have to be a doctor to recognise that Rosy urgently needs 24/7 specialist home care. Instead, a hospice she had used suggested she apply for continuing healthcare (CHC) – the NHS-funded service that provides care workers for people with “primary health needs” outside hospital – and wait for however long it took for swamped assessors to get to her application. In the meantime, the local council had given her a couple of hours of social care a day: a slot with a well-meaning but untrained agency worker to help her get up and another to get to bed.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Tue, 28 Jan 2025 06:00:08 GMT",-0.765,0.7684

The system only launched last week, but already the app has shot to the top of download charts, sparked a $1tn (£800bn) sell-off of tech stocks, and elicited apocalyptic commentary in Silicon Valley. The simplest take on R1 is correct: it’s an AI system equal in capability to state-of-the-art US models that was built on a shoestring budget, thus demonstrating Chinese technological prowess. But the big lesson is perhaps not what DeepSeek R1 reveals about China, but about western neuroses surrounding AI.For AI obsessives, the arrival of R1 was not a total shock. DeepSeek was founded in 2023 as a subsidiary of the Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer, which focuses on data-heavy financial analysis – a field that demands similar skills to top-end AI research. Its subsidiary lab quickly started producing innovative papers, and CEO Liang Wenfeng told interviewers last November that the work was motivated not by profit but “passion and curiosity”.James Vincent was an editor at the Verge, where he specialised in AI, and is the author of Beyond Measure: The Hidden History of Measurement Continue reading...","Tue, 28 Jan 2025 12:26:49 GMT",-0.2023,0.1134
The Guardian,The Guardian view on the future of Gaza: Trump is threatening already frail hopes | Editorial,"Palestinians are returning to the north – but the US president’s desire to ‘just clean out’ the strip, however unrealistic, is deeply concerningPalestinians are returning home to northern Gaza, though few of their homes still stand. Their hospitals, schools and other basic infrastructure are destroyed. For some there are tearful reunions; others search for the bodies of their loved ones. They seek hope amid the&nbsp;rubble of their former lives.Yet new threats loom. Israel and the United Nations are in a standoff over the future of Unwra, the relief agency for Palestinians. An Israeli law ending all cooperation with the agency is due to come into force on Thursday – just as desperately needed aid is finally&nbsp;surging into Gaza. Aid experts say no other entity has the capacity to provide its residents with the&nbsp;long-term support needed. Continue reading...","Tue, 28 Jan 2025 18:38:19 GMT",-0.1531,0.9209
The Guardian,The Guardian view on the British Council: cherish and preserve | Editorial,"Financial struggles dating back to the pandemic are imperilling the future of a bastion of soft power. The government should find a way to helpAs geopolitics takes an increasingly ominous turn in the age of Trump, the government has been focusing on what has been seen as a traditional British&nbsp;diplomatic strength. Earlier this month, the foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, announced the creation of a “soft power council”, aimed at boosting the UK’s reach&nbsp;and reputation abroad.At a time of growing global insecurity and mistrust, it makes sense to mobilise influential figures from industries such as sport and music to help deepen relationships and forge partnerships abroad. Far more difficult to understand is the simultaneous neglect of an institution that has been a world leader in the soft power game for nine decades. Set up to promote understanding of Britain through cultural and&nbsp;educational cooperation with countries all over the&nbsp;world, the British Council has doubled as a powerful ambassador for liberal and democratic values. Yet at a time when these are under renewed threat globally, its depth of expertise and range of connections risk being squandered. Continue reading...","Tue, 28 Jan 2025 18:37:02 GMT",0.3818,0.2516
The Guardian,"The overlap between terrorism, violent attacks and mental health | Letters","It’s not possible to predict horrific acts, writes Stephen Smith while Bill Nightingale and Sarah James draw attention to the underfunding of mental health services and other public services Gaby Hinsliff (Axel Rudakubana walked a long path to murder. At what point could he have been stopped?, 24 January) and your editorial (23 January) ask the question that arises when somebody commits an act that causes us deep distress: “What can we do to prevent this from happening again?” The realistic answer, sadly, is “nothing”, because such obscene acts are not manageable by social care, policing or state intervention. There are very dark places lurking in some human beings, and there are no policies or interventions that will eradicate them. Fortunately, such acts are extremely rare.The law cannot permit “preventive detention”, or punishment before the crime. A large number of people are walking around with sociopathic, psychopathic and disturbing personality characteristics. Until they commit a crime, they cannot have their liberties curtailed. An inquiry might help, though there is a risk that, as ever in moral panics, socially harmful increases in the power of state agencies will penalise significant numbers of people who would do no harm.

In five trips from 1983 to 2011, the visitors only lost one Test, which was enough to decide their only series loss after the second and third matches were heavily washed out.But in 2016 a pretty handy Australian side got whitewashed 3-0, after first dropping the ascendancy in a remarkable turnaround in Pallekele. Then in a shorter series in 2022, after a sizeable win on a surface that spun big, Australia got pummelled by an innings in the second match, while the country they were visiting was in upheaval with massed crowds on the streets causing the popular overthrow of a broken government.

The Guardian,The People Before review – house holds terrible secrets in efficient rural-set thriller,"A family seek a fresh start but their new home isn’t the haven of tranquility they were hoping for in this interesting but predictable thrillerThis slowburn psychological thriller has come up with an interesting slant on the house-with-a-terrible-secret storyline. Based on a novel by the Guardian’s books editor Charlotte Northedge, it’s the story of Jess (Liz White), a charity fundraiser who’s swapped east London for Suffolk, buying a country pile with her husband Pete (Ray Fearon). The move is a fresh start for their marriage, but inevitably the couple’s problems follow them. And Jess’s identity, put on hold by a career break and motherhood, seems to unravel in unfamiliar surroundings, giving the movie an unsettling atmosphere.The house is a fixer upper. So when Pete leaves to catch the six o’clock train to London, Jess’s job, after dropping their son Archie off at primary school, is to manage the building work (there is a vague plan for holiday lets on the grounds). But nothing is going to plan, beginning with the discovery of the dreaded Japanese knotweed in the garden. There’s worse danger lurking in the house, which predictably turns out to have a terrible past, which might explain why the locals are so unfriendly. Jess makes only one new friend in town, brooding local artist Eve (Imelda May). Archie is becoming worryingly withdrawn. Continue reading...","Tue, 28 Jan 2025 13:38:50 GMT",0.0258,0.8349
The Guardian,‘He was unforgettable’: the mesmerising star of cult documentary Andy the Furniture Maker,"He used to fish for oysters but he fled to the hedonism of London, where he was taken under the wing of Derek Jarman. But Andy Marshall was also a creator of dazzling furniture – and the star of a pioneering film about gay lifeIt was 1982 and young film-maker Paul Oremland was in an east London leather and denim pub, about to meet a character who would change his life. “Andy was pretty unforgettable,” recalls Oremland. “Full of amazing tales, and with a wealth of knowledge about people, places and quirky London life.”Oremland had been talking to the fledgling Channel 4 about making a series of documentary films about gay life. This was the era of Aids, Thatcher and queer bashing – gay people only ever seemed to be on the television as the subject of shame or the butt of a joke. But the proudly out Andy Marshall – with his beguiling mix of toughness and fragility – didn’t conform to these stereotypes. Oremland decided to feature him in one of the films he created for the channel’s pioneering Six of Hearts series. Continue reading...","Tue, 28 Jan 2025 14:55:23 GMT",0.0,0.9808
The Guardian,"Rebuilding review – Josh O’Connor is a stoic rancher in sensitive, if slight, wildfire drama","Sundance film festival: The actor delivers another impressive performance, recalling his other rural drama God’s Own Country, in a timely film about recoveryThe difficult question of how one truly recovers from the devastating loss that a wildfire can bring is one that more and more are confronting. It’s been a horrifying year for too many in California, land and lives lost, the unimaginable process of figuring out what comes next now on the horizon. In the writer-director Max Walker-Silverman’s quiet and timely sophomore film Rebuilding, he offers some insight into how this looks and feels, told through the eyes of Josh O’Connor’s stoic rancher.The British actor, coming off his biggest role in Luca Guadagnino’s teasing tennis drama Challengers, plays Dusty, a Colorado man who has just lost almost everything, acres of inherited land gone in an instant. We meet him not long after as he finds himself unmoored, unsure of what his life looks like now, moving to a pokey trailer paid for by rapidly decreasing government funds, forced back into a world he had mostly turned his back on. That world includes his ex-wife Ruby (The White Lotus’s excellent and underused Meghann Fahy) and young daughter Callie Rose (the promising Australian actor Lily LaTorre), who he now has to parent in a way we assume he hasn’t for a while. One of the film’s more effective moments sees Ruby express frustration over how, as a mostly absent father, Dusty can still do no wrong in his child’s mind, a tough pill to swallow for a mother who has taken on the harder day-to-day weight of true parenting. Walker-Silverman, who enjoyed a low-key Sundance hit back in 2022 with the delicate romance A Love Song, tells stories in the smallest of touches, spare dialogue deprioritised over stunning scenery.Rebuilding is screening at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution Continue reading...","Tue, 28 Jan 2025 16:45:16 GMT",0.0,0.9448
The Guardian,My heart will go onstage: Céline Dion and Dolly Parton celebrated in outlandish musicals,"The comedies Titanique and Here You Come Again pay homage to two superstars in quirky style. Actors Lauren Drew and Tricia Paoluccio explain what it’s like to portray their idols – and take on their iconic songsMost biodramas about musicians sing from the same hymn sheet: chart the rise to fame and any fall from grace, flit between studio and stage, make room for relevant lovers and demons. Then add the hits. Two new musicals may find Céline Dion belting out My Heart Will Go On and Dolly Parton warbling I Will Always Love You. But theatregoers should also prepare for this wild-eyed version of Dion to raise merry hell on the Titanic and this particular Parton to miraculously appear in the childhood bedroom of a depressed 40-year-old called Kevin.The off-kilter spirit of the shows, Titanique and Here You Come Again, make them more akin to the Robbie Williams biopic Better Man, featuring a CGI chimpanzee, than Timothée Chalamet’s Oscar-tipped turn as Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.

The Guardian,"The best hot sauces, tasted and rated by Thomasina Miers","Our Mexican food specialist gives us her take on hot sauces from UK supermarkets• ‘An absolute belter’: Grace Dent tests the best extra-chocolatey biscuitsWhat a fun job, tasting hot sauces! I had a great time with my 13-year-old and her Ethiopian pal, who assured me of her skill in this department thanks to the traditionally spicy food her family eats at home.We tasted the sauces on their own and with food. Both are essential: with the first drop, you’re looking for the flavour profile and overall taste; with the second mouthful on food – in our case a margherita pizza – you’re looking for how the heat and flavour of the sauce cut through. The moment the heat from the chillies comes into contact with food, especially carbohydrates and fats, the potency is reduced and the heat is sucked up. If you want a sauce to season food and enhance its flavours, then you need more heat than is obvious, and definitely more heat than when tasting the sauces on their own.

It took five painful years for the case to come to trial, but she was determined to fight for justiceIt was Paula Doyle’s best friend who suggested that her husband walk Doyle home. This was a Friday night in September 2019, and Doyle, then 46, a mother of five, had been at their house for a family party. Doyle had helped clear up at the end. It was 1am and she was the last to leave.Doyle lived close by – three streets and a small stretch of park separated their Dublin houses – and in the past, she would have thought nothing of walking it alone. However, for more than three years, she had been receiving messages from an unknown number. They had started relatively harmlessly (“I’ve seen you around … I’d love to get to know you”) but escalated to graphic images and videos. Doyle and her partner had taken them to the Garda Síochána (the Irish police force), who advised her to block the number, but that didn’t stop them coming in (sometimes more than 50 a day); it only stopped her from having to view them. This was why Doyle allowed her friend’s husband, Aidan Kestell, to walk her home that night. “I thought I’d be safer with him, not knowing who was out there,” she says.

The Guardian,Chanel realigns its logo with bridging catwalk at show focused on timeless skirt suit,"House deploys elegant visual allegory at Grand Palais to keep its name in lights during design interregnumDesigners come and go, but the Chanel tweed suit is for ever. That was the message from a show marking the 110th anniversary of haute couture at Chanel. The house is in the middle of more than a year of catwalk shows without a designer to take a bow – Virginie Viard made her final appearance last May, and her successor, Matthieu Blazy, will not make his first until October – so it is working overtime to keep the Chanel name in lights.The catwalk was formed of two broad curving walkways, which together formed the double C that is instantly recognisable as Chanel. But instead of sitting back to back, as in the logo, the two walkways were teased apart into bridges curving up and over each other, interlinking to form a figure of eight in the shape of the infinity symbol.

The Guardian,How can I reduce the amount of sugar in my baking? | Kitchen aide,"Sugar is important not just for sweetness, but also for texture, colour and bake-ability. So is there a reliable substitute?I love baking, particularly biscuits, but I want to reduce my sugar intake. What’s the best way to do this?“People always ask: ‘Can I just cut the amount of sugar in half or by a quarter?’” says Guardian baking columnist Benjamina Ebuehi, “but it will change everything!” And that, of course, is because sugar isn’t just about sweetness; its other attributes include keeping cakes moist and soft, adding flavour and caramelisation, as well as longevity. “Sugar also adds structure when combined with, say, eggs for the likes of meringue,” Ebuehi says.Sugar is integral to biscuits and cookies, too. “The sugar content for those is high because it is part of the binding, the crispness, how the biscuit spreads, and the flavour,” says Rosie Sykes, author of Every Last Bite, and the brains behind the Friday Biscuit on Instagram.Got a culinary dilemma?

Attention is the means, not the end, because the end is persuasion. Once you have people’s attention, then you can try to persuade them with your evidence and arguments.This, at least, is the traditional model of communication. The trouble is, this basic model has fallen apart. It is crumbling to dust before our eyes, though we have a hard time accepting how far gone it is. The reality is that everywhere you look, there is no longer any formal set of institutions to force public attention on a topic, no basic rules for who will speak when and who will listen.
