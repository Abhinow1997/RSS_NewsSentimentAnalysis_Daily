At least 28 bodies have been recovered from the Potomac River, with recovery operations ongoing.A day before Wednesday night’s midair collision near Reagan airport, a different jet there had to abort its landing and make a second approach after a helicopter appeared near its flight path, the Washington Post reported.The US army saw an increase in very serious aviation incidents during the last fiscal year, with 15 flight and two ground incidents that resulted in deaths of service members, destruction of aircraft, or more than $2.5m in damage to the airframe, the Associated Press reported,Donald Trump and members of his administration claimed, without evidence, that diversity efforts at the FAA under the Biden and Obama administration could be to blame for the crash, with Trump specifically claiming that the FAA had been accused of being “too white,” and suggesting efforts to hire Americans with disabilities were irresponsible.Trump signed an executive order that rolls back diversity initiatives to stop “woke policies” in federal aviation.The Trump administration’s choice to draw an unfounded connection between a deadly tragedy and diversity initiatives at a press conference sparked broad condemnation from Democratic politicians. They called the comments “disgusting,” “despicable,” and “racist,” with Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries saying that Trump was “blaming women and people of color for the deadly plane crash.”As many as 14 skaters and coaches, including two 16-year-olds and a married pair of world champions, were onboard the American Airlines plane. The Skating Club of Boston said Jinna Han and Spencer Lane, both aged 16, and the Russian-born ice skating coaches and former world champions Yevgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who were husband and wife, were on the flight.

Schools are shut, except for those run by volunteers from the pro-democracy resistance in the community. Months of airstrikes have left destruction. Even though the fighting has stopped, electricity is still not running properly. Instead, residents rely on solar power to charge their phones, and firewood and charcoal to cook.“We saw a lot of civilians who died during the battle [in those days]. We saw them on the streets, on the lanes, some of the bodies were decayed and some of them were freshly dead.

The Guardian,David Beckham is modelling in his pants again. Will he not think of his fellow middle-aged men?,"His bronzed torso is ridiculously ripped – and will, once again, cause a shift in the acceptable minimum standards for the male physiqueSo much for the dad bod. David Beckham, who turns 50 this year, has released pictures of himself modelling his new bodywear collection for Hugo Boss. Bodywear, if you’re unfamiliar with the term, appears to mean underwear. In the corresponding ad clip, Beckham returns home for the day in his vintage Aston Martin, Bond-style, but he can’t wait to rip off his sharp suit and slouch around in a leather armchair in nothing but his tighty-whities. He has set the bar very high for middle-aged dads who like to relax by sitting around drinking in their pants, Homer Simpson-style. If you feel at all self-conscious about your soft, squishy, beer-induced centre, Beckham’s new line of smalls will not help.In recent years, the dad bod seemed to be on the verge of widespread public acceptance, even cautious celebration, and a lot of us were congratulating ourselves on our timing: it was not uncommon for men of a certain age to emerge from the first pandemic lockdown looking like a heap of overproved sourdough.

The Guardian,"Marianne Faithfull was a towering artist, not just the muse she was painted as","The late singer made her share of bad decisions – but someone this artistically adventurous and unafraid was never going to have an ordinary life• News: Marianne Faithfull, singular icon of British pop, dies aged 78• Life in picturesIt is difficult to think of a moment in pop history less receptive to a 1960s icon relaunching their career than in 1979. At that point, British rock and pop resolutely inhabited a world shaped by punk: it was the year of 2-Tone and Tubeway Army’s Are ‘Friends’ Electric?, of Ian Dury at No 1 and Blondie releasing the bestselling album of the year. And it was a central tenet of punk that the 1960s and their attendant “culture freaks” were, as Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren put it: “fucking disgusting … vampiric … the most narcissistic generation there has ever been,” and that the decade’s famous names should no longer be afforded the kind of awed reverence they had enjoyed for most of the 70s. “No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones,” as the Clash had sung.And yet Marianne Faithfull, who has died aged 78, turned out to be the kind of famous face from the 60s that a world shaped by punk could get behind. She was living proof that the rock aristocracy were remote and decadent and ripe for the culling. Never given the credit due to her by her most famous associates, the Rolling Stones, she had to go to court to get her name appended to the credits of Sister Morphine, a song she had co-written. She subsequently spiralled downwards, at startling speed, from having a seat at swinging London’s top table to life as a homeless junkie. Her years of addiction on the streets had so ravaged her voice that, by the late 70s, it was completely unrecognisable as coming from the woman who had sung As Tears Go By and Come and Stay With Me.

The Guardian,You’re Cordially Invited review – Reese Witherspoon and Will Ferrell carry fun comedy,"A pair of duelling weddings leads to war in this surprisingly funny, if a little overstuffed, Amazon comedyIn the doldrums of January, with Hollywood gracelessly dumping its shoddiest films, one would have understandable scepticism over Amazon’s glossy wedding confection You’re Cordially Invited. Recent attempts to replicate the big studio comedy for a streaming audience have almost all failed, from the intolerable Vacation Friends movies to Amazon’s heinous Space Cadet to joyless big-star Netflix vehicles like the recent Diaz/Foxx mess Back in Action. Even its stars have tried – Reese Witherspoon with charmless rom-com Your Place or Mine and Will Ferrell with grating Christmas musical Spirited – so expectations weren’t just low, they were deep underground.It also didn’t help that Amazon refused to provide screeners to press, a clear sign that something was up. But even with the many low bars this would all put in place, there’s a surprising amount of low-rent fun to be had here, a simple and silly crowd-pleaser smartly reliant on the high wattage appeal of two, top-of-game professionals. Maybe my enjoyment was also boosted by something else, an ongoing frustration with the industry’s inability to crown a new generation of not just legitimate movie stars but legitimate comedy stars (they seem to exist more on the outskirts now, supporting actors who are in desperate need of it).

The Guardian,An Update on Our Family review – these influencers’ murky tale makes you long to end the internet,"Rachel Mason’s three-part documentary about parents who put their lives online to make big money asks questions about entitlement, child safety, relationships with followers and moreThose of you who already feel that the world is too much would be best advised to stay well away from all three parts of the documentary An Update on Our Family. The family in question are the Stauffers – married couple Myka and James and their children – who were, until very recently, colossally successful family vloggers.Director Rachel Mason’s series starts slowly, spending most of the first hour introducing the uninitiated to the world of YouTubers who specialise in filling their channels with videos of their gorgeous homes, gorgeous children and perfect lives, and to the fans who glom on to these affectless yet somehow intimate and generally wildly aspirational portraits of domestic bliss. “I was literally a part of their life every day,” says former devotee Hannah Cho. She and around 700,000 subscribers to The Stauffer Life channel watched as Myka revealed positive pregnancy tests, had babies, a miscarriage, gave house cleaning tips, appraisals of her post-partum body and altogether so much desirable content that she began to accumulate sponsorship deals and the family’s videos became the family’s (very) lucrative business.

The Guardian,Byth Bythoedd Amen review – searing drama with the edge of standup comedy,"Sherman theatre, Cardiff Mared Jarman’s superb debut play, in which she stars, provides a portrait of reckless nightlife and prejudice towards disabled peopleThe title of Mared Jarman’s play translates as “For ever and Ever Amen”: a playfully pious invocation for a drama that is often darkly adult. It’s a Friday night in Cardiff and Lottie (also played by Jarman) is seeking her own form of salvation, be it through impromptu hotel Tinder hook-ups or trauma-bonding over lines of coke in nightclub toilets. As a portrait of grief and the prejudices experienced by disabled people, this is an assured and impassioned playwriting debut.
 Jarman’s performance is equally fearless. Unapologetic depictions of female sexuality remain relatively rare in Welsh-language theatre, and for the play to also foreground the desires of a blind character feels innovative and overdue. Paul Davies as Lottie’s best friend Bennie – as well as a slew of additional roles – is superb. We hear much about Bennie before he eventually appears onstage, and Davies’ expressive, smiling face seems to confirm an entire loving lifetime within a single expression.
 Designed by Livia Jones, the traverse street scene is redolent of a child’s play mat, contrasting with the gaudy neon pink that invites Lottie on to the sticky dancefloor of the Clam Shack. Garrin Clarke’s lighting is particularly arresting in its fluid shaping of space. Rhian Blythe’s taut direction sustains a production (for Theatr Cymru) that is unafraid of leaning into a heightened theatricality, even as it veers close to camp and despite the content often being somewhat grim.
 The drama seeks to straddle two worlds: destructive youthful abandon and the desire for placid maturity, the provocative and the sincere, light and dark, life and death. Some of the necessary tonal shifts are more disorientating and irreconcilable than others. Frequently, the play is strongest when emulating a darkly confessional standup routine where self-deprecation is wielded as a deflective shield. Alongside the script’s flippant quips about the aftertaste of semen are vicious descriptions of assault and of brutal ableist slurs whose violence is left hanging in the air.At Sherman theatre, Cardiff, until 31 January. Then touring until 13 February. Continue reading...","Thu, 30 Jan 2025 20:00:34 GMT",0.3612,0.9477
The Guardian,"From Godard to Coppola, Van Sant to Anger, Marianne Faithfull was a dazzling magnet for film-makers","The music star was also an electrifying screen presence, from The Girl on a Motorcycle to Marie AntoinetteMarianne Faithfull, singular icon of British pop, dies aged 78Marianne Faithfull was a towering artist, not just the muse she was painted asOn the screen and also in life, Marianne Faithfull experienced something similar to her contemporary Anita Pallenberg – the condescension of being treated like an icon or a muse. Maybe her very real success in music ruled her out of a serious acting career in the eyes of some, but Faithfull for a while occupied the epicentre of the late-60s pop culture zeitgeist, for an intense flashbulb moment she found herself in the overlapping worlds of music, movies and the explodingly important world of celebrity itself.The famous photograph of her in 1967 on a couch between Alain Delon and Mick Jagger absolutely captures her magnetism: Delon is entranced by her, Jagger (her boyfriend) is jealous, looking grumpily down: she and Delon were starring together in The Girl on a Motorcycle by the British cinematographer and director Jack Cardiff in which she was the super-sexy rock chick in a leather body suit whose zipper Delon would lasciviously pull down with his teeth.

The Guardian,I’m delighted MPs are taking paternity leave – if only it were as easy for the rest of us | Tommer Spence,"Ian Murray will be the first minister to take the full two-week entitlement. But he’s wrong to say it’s ‘culture’ preventing other dads doing the sameThe start of a pregnancy is always a time of some uncertainty, but when my partner and I learned we were expecting our second child last year I was faced with a question I hadn’t experienced with our first: would I be able to take any paternity leave? The nature of my work involves working contract-to-contract and I was due to start at a new organisation within days. Britain’s current paternity leave system, fundamentally unchanged since it was implemented in 2003, only entitles fathers or other co-parents to leave if they have been with the same employer since the pregnancy began.The exclusionary nature of paternity leave in the UK has felt like a long-neglected issue in our politics, leading to the emergence of new campaigns such as the Dad Shift. So the news that the Scottish secretary, Ian Murray, will be the first cabinet minister to take full paternity leave – a decision signed off by the prime minister – is a welcome and overdue indication that the people running our country at least have some understanding of the realities facing new parents today.Tommer Spence is a researcher and freelance writer Continue reading...","Thu, 30 Jan 2025 12:41:55 GMT",0.7184,0.1154
The Guardian,Europe needs to stand up for Greenland. It is failing | Nathalie Tocci,"There are rational explanations for the continent’s muted response to Donald Trump’s threats – but that’s not how you deal with this presidentDonald Trump’s antics over the past week have put paid to the refrain, often heard in Europe, that the president should be taken “seriously but not literally”. It turns out that Trump literally wants Greenland. He doubled down on his aggressive rhetoric in a raging 45-minute call with the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, a few days ago, threatening crippling tariffs unless she agreed to sell the autonomous territory to the US. In response to Denmark’s sharp increase in military spending for the Arctic, including ships and drones, he derided Copenhagen’s “dog-sled” defences for Greenland, the world’s largest non-continental island, which pale in comparison with the strength of the US military base there.The threat to take over the territory of a European country by force is something that Europeans now know all too well. Russia has repeatedly threatened east European countries, making good on those threats by invading Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine since 2014. Yet many Europeans are gobsmacked that such a threat is now coming from its greatest ally. Continue reading...","Thu, 30 Jan 2025 07:00:30 GMT",-0.5106,-0.6808

After 14 years of environmental vandalism, it might have seemed impossible for Labour to offer anything but improvement. But on green issues, this government is worse than the Tories.The last prime minister to insist that growth should override every other consideration, and to fling insults at anyone who disagreed, was Liz Truss.

The greatest concentration is around Reagan National airport, the city’s principal domestic hub, which sits on the west bank of the Potomac River within sight of the Capitol dome.No one yet knows how a Black Hawk military helicopter collided with an American Eagle flight from Wichita above the Potomac on Wednesday evening. But the destruction was total. No survivors have been found from among the 64 people on board the flight from Kansas or among the three-strong crew of the helicopter. By early Thursday, the rescue effort was already a recovery operation.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on the children’s bill: academy freedoms are beside the point | Editorial,"The government deserves praise for delivering breakfast clubs, a home schooling register and admissions reformThe fuss kicked up by the Conservatives about the education bill over the past month has been about trying to land political blows – not making the lives of children in England safer or better. MPs’ horror at sexual exploitation gangs is sincere, but attempting to bolt a public inquiry on to Bridget Phillipson’s bill was an ill-judged attempt to sour the mood around an important piece of progressive legislation. That amendment was defeated. But ministers were rattled when Kemi Badenoch echoed complaints by academy leaders that the bill will cramp their style. Wording was altered so that they will not, after all, be obliged to pay teachers in accordance with nationally agreed pay scales.Ministers should now draw a line and stand their ground. The shortage of teachers in key subjects is a problem that got worse under the Conservatives. It is questionable whether tighter pay rules would have caused the harm claimed, and Sir Keir Starmer was right to stress that there is nothing remarkable about requiring teachers in all schools to be qualified. Mrs&nbsp;Badenoch’s jibe – are Olympians not qualified to teach PE? – was a rhetorical flourish, not a serious point.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Medicine that crosses the mind/body divide | Letters,"Readers reflect on Aida Edemariam’s piece about what can be a fine line between physical symptoms and conditions dismissed as being ‘all in your head’While enjoying Aida Edemariam’s review of current neuro-psychological research (The mind/body revolution: how the division between ‘mental’ and ‘physical’ illness fails us all, 26 January), I disagree with her assertion that “A conceptual division between mind and body has underpinned western culture, and medicine for centuries. Illnesses are ‘physical’, or they are ‘mental’.”Samuel Taylor Coleridge coined the term “psychosomatic” in the late 18th century to describe bodymind conditions, while the term “placebo” was first used in the same period, referencing a link between imagination and physical symptom. A few years later, in 1800, the physician John Haygarth published the widely read pamphlet Of the Imagination As a Cause and a Cure of Disorders of the Body.

It is interesting that four of Forest’s last five – and five of their last eight – Premier League games rank in their bottom eight of the season on pass completion. “We have to perform much better,” he said. “We have to be more solid and play better football. We have so many things to improve.” Though results in that period, at least until last week, continued to be good they have relied on statistically unlikely displays of finishing prowess. Before their trip to Bournemouth, Forest had scored with nine of their previous 12 shots on target in all competitions and the last time a Chris Wood shot on target failed to go in was before Christmas. Both Nuno and Fabian Hürzeler were sent off for misconduct during a rancorous conclusion to the fixture between these sides at the Amex Stadium last September.

The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: elderly couples among nine killed in Russian drone attack,"Thirteen people wounded, including eight-year-old girl, in Sumy apartment block attack. Sweden pledges $1.2bn in Ukraine military aid, its biggest pledge yet. What we know on day 1,073See all our Ukraine war coverageA Russian drone attack on a residential block killed nine people including three elderly couples in the eastern Ukrainian city of Sumy, officials said on Thursday. Images distributed by the emergency services showed a gaping hole in the facade of the long block of flats and rescue workers digging through debris for survivors. “This is a terrible tragedy, a terrible Russian crime. It is very important that the world does not pause in putting pressure on Russia for this terror,” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on social media. National Police later said the search operation had been completed after 19 hours, with rescuers finding nine bodies in the ruins, while 13 people were wounded. Among the dead were three couples – men and women between the ages of 61 and 74 – Ukrainian prosecutors said. Those killed also included a 37-year-old woman, while her eight-year-old daughter was wounded, the Sumy prosecutor’s office said.Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump’s nominee for national intelligence director, partially recanted her views that Russia was provoked into invading Ukraine, during a tense confirmation hearing before the Senate intelligence committee. Colorado senator Michael Bennet attacked Gabbard for a tweet sent out just hours after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in which she said: “This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/Nato had simply acknowledged Russia’s legitimate security concerns.” While she did not explain those remarks, she did indicate that she had had a change of heart. Asked bluntly who she blamed for the war between Russia and Ukraine, she said: “Putin started the invasion of Ukraine.”Sweden’s government on Thursday pledged an additional $1.2bn in military aid to Ukraine, saying Europe needed to prepare to shoulder a larger part in supporting Kyiv. Defence minister Pal Jonson said the package, the country’s 18th since Russia’s 2022 invasion, was the largest to date and was a sign that Sweden was ready to support Ukraine in the “long term”. “This is also a signal to our other allies that we need to prepare for Europe to take more responsibility for supporting Ukraine,” Jonson told a press conference.Ukraine’s foreign ministry summoned Slovakia’s ambassador on Thursday to reject accusations that it is meddling in its neighbour’s internal affairs and to accuse Slovak prime minister Robert Fico of being a “mouthpiece” for Russia. Kyiv and Bratislava have been at odds for weeks over Ukraine’s decision not to extend a Russian gas transit deal that expired at the end of December. Kyiv’s move came a day after Slovakia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned the Ukrainian ambassador to protest against Ukrainian comments criticising Fico that it said amounted to interference in Slovak affairs.A British man captured fighting on the Ukrainian side in Russia’s Kursk region will face terrorism and mercenary charges that could see him jailed for years, Russian state investigators said on Thursday. Moscow announced in November it had captured James Anderson, describing him as a former British soldier. Britain’s foreign minister, David Lammy, said at the time he was aware of the case and that London would do all it could to offer him assistance. Russia’s Investigative Committee released video on Thursday showing a handcuffed Anderson dressed in a prison uniform with a shaven head, being brought into a room for questioning and confirming his name. In a statement, it said he would face terrorism and mercenary charges on allegations he participated “in an armed conflict as a mercenary on the territory of the Russian Federation for financial remuneration”. It did not say how Anderson pleaded to the charges, some of which are punishable by up to 20 years in jail if he is found guilty. Continue reading...","Fri, 31 Jan 2025 00:48:50 GMT",-0.91,-0.9979

Like the game that preceded it, Citizen Sleeper 2 is packed with evocative portrayals of everyday life in outer space, from farmers tending zero-G crops in an asteroid greenhouse to water miners rising up against the cartel that controls them, everyone eking out a meagre existence in crumbling space stations left to rot by a long-dead mega corporation.Once again you’re cast as a Sleeper, a robot with a digitised human mind shorn of the memories of the person it was copied from. In the first game you were on the run from the firm that made you, attempting to wean your robot off its reliance on a stabilising drug.

The Guardian,Opus review – John Malkovich plays an evil pop star in a silly horror dud,"Sundance film festival: The cult of celebrity is targeted in a progressively nonsensical and poorly made debut with too much on its plateAnyone who has written about a much-loved music star with even the vaguest hint of light criticism will be aware of the horrors that can often follow. The tribal intensity of extremely online and extremely sensitive fandoms can lead to either a mild torrent of more tolerable abuse or something far darker, like death threats and sometimes doxing, an unending rage erupting from people who use emojis as avatars. There’s a great thriller to be made about this unpleasant tension, the fans who will do anything for their idol and the idol who will do nothing to stop them, but Opus, a poppy new A24 misfire premiering at Sundance, is not that movie.It’s the first film from the writer-director Mark Anthony Green, who, like many before him, is so fixated on what he wants to say that he hasn’t been able to figure out how to say it. There’s maybe a slicker, simpler and more satisfying murder mystery to be told here – an assortment of media types picked off one-by-one at the remote ranch of a reclusive pop star – but he’s challenged himself with something far harder and ultimately too far out of his reach.

I had a great time with my 13-year-old and her Ethiopian pal, who assured me of her skill in this department thanks to the traditionally spicy food her family eats at home.We tasted the sauces on their own and with food. Both are essential: with the first drop, you’re looking for the flavour profile and overall taste; with the second mouthful on food – in our case a margherita pizza – you’re looking for how the heat and flavour of the sauce cut through. The moment the heat from the chillies comes into contact with food, especially carbohydrates and fats, the potency is reduced and the heat is sucked up. If you want a sauce to season food and enhance its flavours, then you need more heat than is obvious, and definitely more heat than when tasting the sauces on their own.
