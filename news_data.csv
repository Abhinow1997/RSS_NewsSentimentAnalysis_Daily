The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Stray Russian drones ‘hit Moldova and Romania’,"Ukrainian neighbours summon Russian ambassadors citing crashes and explosions on their soil; Europe ‘would help Ukraine resist without US help’. What we know on day 1,087See all our Ukraine war coverageMoldova and Nato member Romania announced they had summoned Russia’s ambassadors after its drones struck their territory. Russia has been targeting port infrastructure in Ukraine’s south, close to the borders with Romania and Moldova. “Shahed drones violated our airspace, two exploded on our soil, putting Moldovan lives at risk” as part of Moscow’s “criminal” war on Ukraine, said Romania’s president, Maia Sandu. According to Moldovan authorities, two drones crashed in fields, and drone fragments were later discovered in a third location. Moldova announced it would close the Russian Cultural Centre, which opened in 2009 and employed six Russian diplomats in 2023, according to local media. The pro-Kremlin Socialist party called that “unprecedented and provocative” and “Russophobia”.In Romania, Russia’s envoy was also summoned by Bucharest after radar systems identified an aerial target violating airspace and searchers later found drone fragments, determining that two drones that “carried explosive charges onboard” were destroyed when they hit the ground. “These illegal and irresponsible attacks must stop, and Romania reserves the right to take the necessary measures,” Romaina’s foreign ministry said in a statement.There were feelings of anger and betrayal on the streets of central Kyiv after Donald Trump’s call with Vladimir Putin, Shaun Walker and Artem Mazhulin write from Kyiv. “There is no certainty that this war will end for us, because Trump does not perceive us as an equal party in these negotiations,” said Oleksii, 34. Serhii, a 39-year-old soldier, said Trump had been “Putin’s doormat” during his last presidency and although he was sceptical about negotiating with “this bastard” Putin, “we do have to negotiate, but on Ukraine’s terms”. Roman, 20, said it was “obvious” for Trump to call Putin and direct contact should have been established earlier. “I’m glad that the parties have started to find a common language, though I’m afraid at what cost.”On the Russian side, “Putin has won the first round” of negotiations, a source in the Russian foreign policy establishment told Pjotr Sauer. “A direct call with Trump was precisely what Putin had been waiting for.” “Zelenskyy had repeatedly urged Trump to speak with him first before engaging with Putin. Instead, Trump did the exact opposite,” gloated Sergei Markov, a popular Russian commentator.Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, said peace negotiations could not be left to Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin alone, and Ukraine would not accept a deal made that was. He said it was “unpleasant” that Trump had spoken to Russia before Ukraine.The EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said that if a deal was made without Ukraine, “the Ukrainians will resist and we will support them”. Kallas accused Washington of “appeasement” towards Russia, insisting that no deal “behind our backs” could work. “You need the Europeans, you need the Ukrainians,” she said. “If Ukraine decides to resist, Europe will back its principles. Yes, we are 20% less if the US decides to withdraw, but still, Ukraine will defend the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity. And we are there together.”The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, rejected any “dictated peace”, arguing that “a Russian victory or a Ukrainian collapse will not lead to peace – on the contrary … This would put peace and stability in Europe at risk, far beyond Ukraine.” Continue reading...","Fri, 14 Feb 2025 01:00:08 GMT",-0.5994,0.5313

The Guardian,I’m worried my appearance will jeopardise my career opportunities. Should I modify my look to fit in? | Leading questions,"Most of us are not our complete selves at work, advice columnist Eleanor Gordon-Smith writes. But it’s up to you where you want to draw the lineRead more Leading questionsI am a woman in my mid-40s. For the best part of a decade I’ve had very short hair. It’s convenient, easy to maintain and I genuinely like a slightly androgynous look – always have done. In the past year I’ve dyed it a variety of colours (purple, red and orange) as it grows out quickly. My short hair also reveals another aspect about me: I wear hearing aids. I don’t care about strangers knowing about my deafness. If folks can easily see my hearing aids, it means I don’t have to “out” myself to every new person I meet. 
  It only concerns me at the moment as I would like to consider applying for a new job. Appearing “other” and deaf are not necessarily assets to have when entering this market. When I was previously job hunting I had longer hair and better hearing. The field I work in currently is quite conservative and male-dominated. Should I modify my appearance to fit in and be conventional, or will being true to myself work to my advantage in the long run?Eleanor says: Two things we know: appearances shouldn’t matter; your hair cut or colour is not an indication of talent and it’s downright illegal to treat your hearing aid as one. But appearances often do matter. Every aesthetic choice tells people how to read us, even the choice to avoid aesthetic choices. Continue reading...","Thu, 13 Feb 2025 14:00:01 GMT",0.4404,0.879

He would be unlikely to endorse the warty portrait of his political idol in Howard Brenton’s Churchill in Moscow. And now, in The Autobiography of a Cad, an egotistical, Shakespeare-quoting, wildly reproductive Old Etonian and Oxonian Tory looks back on a public life in memoirs that prove to be unreliable and self-serving.Some relief for the former prime minister is that Edward Fox-Ingleby becomes a broader portrait of privileged chancers in English public life. He gives a Sunak-like oration in a downpour, lounges on a Commons bench in the Rees-Mogg manner, suffers David Cameron and Liz Truss’s overconfidence about their political nous, leans towards the biographical inaccuracy of Jeffrey Archer and shares Prince Andrew’s appetite for shooting weekends (though not pizza).

The Guardian,What should the Grenfell memorial look like? History has some answers | Neal Shasore,"Whatever stands in the tower’s footprint should be inspired by the community – and remind us that such a tragedy must never happen again For the past seven years, Grenfell Tower has been cloaked in white wrapping, protecting the fire-damaged fabric from further corrosion and the public from falling debris. This shroud covers a monumental cenotaph, a visceral reminder of the tragedy that claimed 72 lives and upended so many others. Now, the deputy prime minister has decided that the tower will be demolished in time for the 10th anniversary of the fire in 2027. The justification is that the tower is structurally vulnerable, and – insipidly – because there is no consensus among the community groups and campaigns seeking reparative justice.Many of these groups have said they felt ignored by the government’s decision, while local residents remain divided. What is clear is that a top-down verdict from central government has obscured some of the careful thinking and deep engagement by various communities at a local level. As attention turns toward the construction of a permanent memorial, there are questions as to whether this can be handled with the appropriate sensitivity and proper consultation.

Sadly, not everyone agrees. That’s why, when I hear about an AI dream interpretation app, I’m seduced by the potential for a captive, preternaturally intelligent assistant to help me decipher the more baffling corners of my psyche.AI chatbots such as ChatGPT have a well-known tendency to riff and exaggerate with alarming confidence, but their verbose nature feels well-suited to the free form and highly associative task of dream analysis. Admittedly, trading little understood fragments of our slumbering minds to a tech startup in return for spiritual guidance sounds like the foreboding premise of a terrifying sci-fi horror movie. But the app’s fine print promises that dreams are stored “safely and privately”.

The Guardian,Does the government really know what it wants from the CMA? | Nils Pratley,"Some directives such as ‘be more agile’ are meaningless, and what happens when the ‘pro-growth’ agenda collides with the ‘pro-competition’ one?The government seemed to give a strong steer that it wanted the Competition and Markets Authority to do things differently when it ousted its chair, Marcus Bokkerink, last month. But what, precisely, does Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, wish to see?His headline demand that the CMA should be “more agile” was meaningless – no politician, one suspects, has ever encouraged any regulator to be less nimble. Reynolds’ formal ministerial “strategic steer” was slightly better on specifics but not by much. It mostly rehearsed the government’s unconvincing but now-familiar refrain that there’s a role for regulators to play in encouraging growth and investment.

The Guardian,Trump and Musk’s attack on USAid is causing global chaos. Millions of lives are now at risk | Devi Sridhar,"On top of the human cost, the US’s soft power and influence is disappearing. Russia and China will fill the voidAmid the daily troubling news coming from the United States are the ongoing and increasingly damaging efforts by President Donald Trump, supported by secretary of state Marco Rubio and Elon Musk, to shut down the US Agency for International Development (USAid). Musk has called it a “criminal organization” and said that it was “time for it to die”. The agency website is down, so little official information is available. But in the week since funding to the agency was frozen, and the majority of staff placed on leave, thousands of public health and development programmes worldwide have been thrown into turmoil, and now face an uncertain future.USAid is the main federal agency that works to provide foreign aid assistance to the poorest countries and people in the world. On Friday, a US judge prevented around 2,000 USAid employees from being placed on leave, and ordered the reinstatement of about 500 more. But Trump and Musk appear to want to move forward with a plan that would see its global workforce reduced from about 10,000 staff and contractors, to just over 600.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh Continue reading...","Thu, 13 Feb 2025 12:12:50 GMT",-0.836,-0.9052

Last year, it sparked another gold rush – and looming calamity for local authoritiesPerhaps only England could make its politician of the moment a woman who died more than a decade ago. Yet turn on Channel 4 and watch Margaret Thatcher: the drama. Radio 4 offers Margaret Thatcher: the play, while soon you can enjoy Thatcher: the opera. For those who can’t wait, there’s Thatcher: the news story, as the British media celebrates 50 years this week since she was crowned Tory leader.Such pieces are reliably more fascinated by how she looked (Shoulder pads! Handbag! Blond halo!) than what she did. So let me tell you a story about one of Thatcher’s deeds that shapes how we live today. Rather than some dusty tale dug out of the archive, it’s unfolding right now. And you won’t have seen it in any other newspaper.Brent saw a more than 7,000% rise in right-to-buy (RTB) applications in November over the month before; in Lambeth and Camden, it was more than 2,000%, for Southwark, 1,500%.November’s flood of applications means Lewisham is dealing with more bids this financial year than it received in the previous four years put together, while Hackney is managing the equivalent of more than three years’ worth of would-be buyers.Islington got 922 RTB applications in November alone, where it would normally expect closer to 200 over an entire year.With months still left of this financial year, London authorities have together already received 3.5 times the RTB applications they got last year.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Thu, 13 Feb 2025 08:00:01 GMT",0.0,0.8544
The Guardian,Trump’s senseless capitulation to Putin is a betrayal of Ukraine – and terrible dealmaking | Timothy Garton Ash,"As the US and its European allies head to the Munich security conference, Europe must learn from its tragic history and oppose appeasementDonald Trump’s appeasement of Vladimir Putin makes Neville Chamberlain look like a principled, courageous realist. At least Chamberlain was trying to prevent a major European war, whereas Trump is acting in the middle of one. Trump’s “Munich” (synonymous in English with the 1938 deal in which Britain and France sold out Czechoslovakia to Nazi Germany) comes on the eve of the big security conference in today’s Bavarian capital, where his emissaries will meet western allies. That Munich security conference must be the beginning of a decisive European response, learning from our own tragic history in order to avoid repeating it.The next step Trump proposes is in effect a new “Yalta” (referring to the February 1945 US-Soviet-UK summit in the Crimean resort of Yalta, which has become synonymous with superpowers deciding the fate of European countries over their heads). In this case, his proposal is that the US and Russia should decide the fate of Ukraine with marginal if any involvement of Ukraine or other European countries. But this time the occupants of the White House and the Kremlin should meet first in Saudi Arabia, then in their respective capitals, while it seems the actual Yalta, in the Crimea, is to be ceded to Russia. For in the brave new world of Trump and Putin, might is right and territorial expansion is what great powers do, be it Russia to Ukraine, the US to Canada and Greenland – or China to Taiwan.Timothy Garton Ash is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Trump and Putin: Ukraine’s future must not be decided without it | Editorial,"The US president wants to end this war – and is happy to do so on Russian termsUkraine and its European allies braced for the worst when Donald Trump won a second term. But the scale of his surrender to Russian aggression has still shocked them. On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin’s nearly three years of isolation by the west was broken by his 90-minute, “highly productive” conversation with Mr&nbsp;Trump. Joe Biden called the Russian president a murderous dictator; Mr Trump praised Mr Putin’s mounting aggression towards Ukraine as “genius”, days before the full-scale invasion of 2022. Now, two great powers plan negotiations – without regard for Ukraine, Europe or even Mr Trump’s own Ukraine envoy.Forget territorial integrity. The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, described a return to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders as “unrealistic” and “an illusory goal”. Forget Ukrainian membership of Nato: “I don’t think it’s practical … I’m OK with that,” Mr Trump declared. Forget US support: it will be up to European countries and others to provide any deterrent force, the US defence secretary made clear. European security is no longer the primary focus for the US, added Mr Hegseth – and that was the toned-down version.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"The Guardian view on Britain’s broken economy: ‘That’s your bloody GDP, not ours’ | Editorial","Despite growth in 2024, living standards fell. Inequality, weak public investment and government cuts threaten prosperity. Labour must offer voters something different The picture painted by official data for the UK economy in 2024 reveals a country broken by 14&nbsp;years of Conservative party rule. True, the economy grew – somewhat unexpectedly – but GDP per head fell, showing prosperity didn’t reach most people. There are a few reasons for this decline but none suggests a healthy society. One is runaway wealth inequality, with gains hoarded at the top. Another is stark regional disparities, with some areas falling further behind despite national GDP rising. A third is rising immigration without enough job creation – more workers, but not enough well-paying positions.A growing economy means little if it doesn’t improve living standards. In 2024, it didn’t. This political reality has shaped recent years, and not in a good way. It’s worth recalling a Newcastle woman’s tart response to the political scientist Anand Menon in 2016 when he warned that Brexit would hit GDP: “That’s your bloody GDP, not ours.” That continuing frustration explains the current backlash against mainstream politicians. No wonder Sir&nbsp;Keir Starmer wants his party to be one of disruption.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,How arms dealing has compromised Britain’s foreign policy | Letters,"Dr Sam Perlo-Freeman, Paul Bennett, Helen Jones and Laura Harling respond to an article by a former diplomat on the UK’s complicity in war crimesThe testimony of the former Foreign Office policy adviser Mark Smith confirms exactly what the Campaign Against Arms Trade has been arguing for decades – the UK’s arms-export control system is rotten to its core (I saw illegality and complicity with war crimes. That’s why I quit the UK Foreign Office, 9 February). When we successfully took the government to court to stop arming Saudi Arabia, the key legal and moral questions were essentially the same. How could the UK government continue supplying arms in the face of overwhelming evidence of the most horrific crimes being committed against civilians?What Smith’s evidence shows is that the only way for the Foreign Office to keep doing this is to bully civil servants and diplomats into changing their reports, warning them not to leave any written evidence, or even asking them to “delete correspondence”. There has been a systematic effort to manipulate and suppress the truth. Continue reading...","Thu, 13 Feb 2025 17:16:53 GMT",0.0,-0.9668

As a hearing-aid user, I have found that only the RSC at Stratford-upon-Avon offers an exemplary service when it comes to captioned performances (which I have to say has transformed my enjoyment of Shakespeare). Too many theatres offer nothing at all. Well done to Tim Rice for highlighting this issue, but please don’t stop at musicals.Alan GentCheadle, Cheshire• Hear, hear to Tim Rice’s suggestion that musicals have surtitles – and not just musicals. I should like to go to more theatre performances, but, being hard&nbsp;of&nbsp;hearing, miss out unless there are surtitles. My experience is that the loop systems that link to hearing aids are poor or don’t work in most theatres and cinemas, and it’s potluck if one’s seat is in a position to receive a signal.

A brilliant header to equalise before setting up Kaoru Mitoma’s winner gave Fabian Hürzeler’s side the confidence boost they needed after their 7-0 mauling against Nottingham Forest, with Rutter justifying his manager’s decision to leave João Pedro on the bench. Rutter – who has seven goals in all competitions – did not start a Premier League game in January after struggling with a hamstring problem and Hürzeler has been mindful of protecting the 22-year-old, although he will be itching to face Enzo Maresca’s side for the second time in six days. “There were a lot of personal duels and he proved that he can win the majority of them, and that’s why I’m happy with him,” said Hürzeler.

He was speaking in relation to Abdoulaye Doucouré’s provocative celebrations in front of the Liverpool support. Liverpool’s loss of control before the final whistle, however, was not normal for an Arne Slot team, though it also fuelled the anger that exploded on their final trip across Stanley Park.There was comfort amid the mayhem of the last Merseyside derby at Goodison for Liverpool in the form of a seven-point lead over striker-less Arsenal at the top of the Premier League. There were also questions to be asked of Liverpool’s second successive below-par performance at the home of their oldest rivals. The visitors at least departed with a valuable point on this occasion but deserved no more, however much the manner of James Tarkowski’s 98th-minute equaliser stung.

Those who do not quite fit the mould – particularly those taking over from a recently departed legend – have to work doubly hard to shift entrenched perceptions.Dan Biggar, Wales’s most-capped fly-half, was instructive on the subject in his thought-provoking autobiography, The Biggar Picture. “Throughout my career I’d constantly had to silence the critics.

The Guardian,Ke Huy Quan: ‘I wish everyone could have their own Oscar moment’,"The actor on being star-struck by Harrison Ford, colour-blind casting and the question he is asked the mostCyndi Lauper, Michael Jackson and Clint Eastwood were among the celebrities who dropped by during the filming of The Goonies. Who were you most star-struck by? McScootikinsHarrison Ford! I was star-struck when Harrison Ford came to visit because I’d made Indy [Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]. Spielberg played a big joke on him. There was a biography out of him that he really hated, so Steven went out and bought about 300 copies, so that when Harrison came to visit and walked on to set, the security guard, the gaffers, the camera equipment people, everybody was reading that biography.
 I remember when we were told that Michael Jackson was going to visit. The cast and crew were so excited. We didn’t know what time he was arriving, so we were constantly looking over our shoulder. Sure enough, when he walked on to the set, everybody just stopped what they were doing – even the guy making the coffee. He was very shy. I think we made him nervous because there were so many people. Then we took those photos that you see on the internet. We were so giddy that he was there. He gave us tickets to watch him perform in Los Angeles, and gave us all a jacket, which some of us still have. Somehow I lost mine, which I’m very mad at myself for.

The Guardian,John Glacier: Like a Ribbon album review – this otherworldly British voice is in a class of her own,"(Young)She frames herself as an alien visitor, and sure enough, this ideas-packed album at the edges of rap doesn’t sound like anyone else right now – you’ll be repeating it again and againYou could easily read Steady As I Am, from John Glacier’s debut album, as a mission statement. “I’m sticking to the plan, not the game,” the British rapper offers. “Think I’m crazy, ’cause you’re all the same.” In a genre characterised by flash, Glacier cuts a unique figure, her USP a kind of wilful obfuscation. She doesn’t reveal her real name – the space where it should be on her Instagram bio is instead filled by the word “NO” – nor her age: she once told the Guardian she was “20,000” years old. She first attracted attention with a SoundCloud page, filled with snippets of music she had given shrugging, prosaic titles: A Child Was Sad So I Made This in Front of Her to Make Her Laugh; Sounds From Friday Evening. Said snippets have long been deleted, but a fragmentary, demo-like quality has clung to her releases ever since: the 12 short tracks on her 2022 mixtape Shiloh: Lost for Words played out in a mass of muffled synth tones and distorted samples.More than one critic has compared the effect of her vocal style – occasional bursts of brisk lyricism separated by sections in which she incants the same phrases over and over, as if in a stoned daze – to overhearing someone’s scattered voice memos. On Like a Ribbon, even her most pugilistic lines – “I’m the hottest in the game”; “I don’t give a fuck, let the people talk”; “now they’re calling me a bitch – best believe it” – are delivered in an oddly blank tone, as if she’s muttering them to herself, unaware that anyone’s listening. Elsewhere, her lyrics have a stream-of consciousness effect, a splurge of words written to try to work out how she feels – or perhaps just because she likes the way they sound together: “Like a satellite in the dark / In the night / Whereabouts in the clouds like a kite / Floating in the winds let the birds float by,” runs a characteristic line on opener Satellites.

The Guardian,Elgar: The Dream of Gerontius album review – thoughtful and acutely sensitive to tiniest nuances,"Findon/Rice/Williams/Finnish RSO/Collon(Ondine)This is a very distinguished addition to the pantheon of Gerontius recordings, and Christine Rice is as good an Angel as any on disc since Janet BakerThe great majority of the 20-odd recordings to date of this greatest of Elgar’s greatest choral works have been made by British conductors, most of them working with British orchestras and soloists. There are notable exceptions of course, most recently Daniel Barenboim’s version with the Berlin Staatskapelle, there’s even a version conducted by Yevgeny Svetlanov with the USSR Symphony Orchestra and British singers, while two of John Barbirolli’s three recordings were made with the New York Philharmonic and the Orchestra of RAI in Rome. But here we have a British conductor, Nicholas Collon, recording Gerontius with a Finnish orchestra and a mixed chorus of Finnish and British singers, in a performance taken from a concert in Helsinki last April.It’s a very distinguished addition to the pantheon of Gerontius recordings, conducted by Collon with acute sensitivity to the tiniest nuances in Elgar’s score. Timings may suggest that overall it is one of the faster versions on record, but nothing about it feels rushed or overpressed; both the solo sections and the great choral set pieces have just the right spaciousness, and all the necessary dramatic bite when required in sections like the Demons chorus, while the exchanges between Gerontius and the Angel in the second part of the oratorio are never made too overtly operatic nor too piously formal.

The Guardian,"‘Unusually soft, mushy, oddly bland’: the best (and worst) baked beans, tasted and rated by Felicity Cloake","Our resident perfectionist applies her forensic insight to the high street’s baked bean offerings• The food filter: which supermarket has the best extra-virgin olive oil?Baked beans are one of those homely foods that are so familiar that most of us don’t give them even a second thought on the shelf – we reach for our usual brand, tick it off the list and reserve our mental bandwidth for more exciting foodstuffs. After all, just how different can a tin of beans be? To my surprise, I discovered very striking disparities between the ones I tested, so if you’re someone who routinely decants excess juice or reduces the sauce to achieve that authentic school dinner effect, you might be better off simply switching allegiance. Similarly, the sugar content varied between 9% of your recommended daily allowance to 13%, so if that’s a concern, look out for reduced- or no-sugar brands instead.There’s a significant price difference between supermarket own labels and the leading brands, too. If you’re after a gourmet experience, I’d recommend the Bold Bean Co’s rich tomato baked beans (£3.50), because they remind me of those homemade beans you sometimes get with a fry-up at fancy cafes: intensely savoury and packed full of herbs. They don’t qualify here, because they are to ordinary baked beans what rye sourdough is to white sliced, but they’re bloody lovely all the same. That said, you can’t go wrong with any of our best buys served on buttered toast with a light dusting of grated cheddar. Small pleasures don’t come much cheaper.

His enemies accuse him of treasonIn early 1964, Jean Ziegler, a young Swiss politician, received a phone call from a man claiming to represent Ernesto “Che” Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary and minister of industry. Che would be in Geneva in March for a UN conference on trade policy, and some comrades had suggested Jean might be his chauffeur during his stay. Was Ziegler available for the gig?Today, in his tenth decade of life, Ziegler is Switzerland’s most notorious public intellectual. That’s because, over the course of writing about 30 books, serving for close to three decades in the Swiss parliament, and relentlessly crusading for leftwing causes in his free time, Ziegler has made a career of unsparing criticism of his home country and its outsize influence on the rest of the world. In the 1960s, though, he was just another eager young leftist, waiting for his chance to change the world. Continue reading...","Thu, 13 Feb 2025 05:00:47 GMT",-0.4939,-0.2094
The Guardian,"‘No one tells you how to not fall on your face’: Christina Hendricks on Mad Men, stardom and her ‘spidey sense’","She went stratospheric in the hit ad agency show, but wishes it had happened 10 years earlier. As Christina Hendricks plays a Hollywood mogul, she talks about the whirlwind of fame – and what happens when it stopsIt would be too much of a spoiler to reveal the dark secret at the heart of the new comedy drama Small Town, Big Story, but I can say that it’s huge, weird and unbelievable. In the six-part show, Christina Hendricks plays Wendy Patterson, a Los Angeles TV producer who is back in her small home town in Ireland to shoot a big Hollywood production. She has returned, successful and glossy, to the place where that weird experience changed her life – not least because nobody believed her and she was laughed out of town.Hendricks plays Wendy spiky and tough. “She’s got a real defence mechanism,” she says. “Something extraordinary happened to her and no one has ever believed her. She’s built up a wall, not letting people get too close, because then she’d have to reveal this big secret that, again, they are not going to believe.” Continue reading...","Wed, 12 Feb 2025 16:39:31 GMT",-0.4939,0.9808

The Guardian,500lb black bear survives LA wildfires hiding under house – video,"For those lucky enough to have a place to return to in Altadena, going home meant dealing with unfinished chores left behind when the Eaton fire forced them to evacuate. For Samy Arbid, who had moved into a property just a block from the fire line in November, there was a different kind of challenge: a 525lb (240kg) black bear. It had moved into the crawl space under the house before the fire and was still sheltering there when Arbid and his wife returned. The California wildfire department stepped in to help, luring the bear out with treats after deciding it was too big to tranquillise. The bear's new home is much more appropriate: the Angeles national forest Continue reading...","Wed, 05 Feb 2025 22:20:28 GMT",-0.296,-0.7645

This image opened doors for him, leading to advert and movie work’I first met Guðjón Þorsteinsson through my work as a photographer for the Icelandic daily newspaper Morgunblaðið. He and his older brother, Óskar, ran a farm above the peninsula of Dyrhólaey, a couple of hours’ drive from Reykjavík. A raging storm had broken lots of power lines so the farm had no electricity. I’d heard the brothers were having to milk their cows by hand and thought I might be able to get a good picture for the paper.When Guðjón opened the door, he just said: “What do you want?” He wasn’t very friendly, though I sensed this was an act. He invited me in for coffee and I ended up getting the shots I wanted, but after they ran in the paper, someone complained that the cows looked dirty and they were taken away. Feeling it was my fault, I went back to the farm to apologise. Guðjón said: “I’m glad – I didn’t want to milk them anyway.” Continue reading...","Wed, 12 Feb 2025 15:28:22 GMT",0.6369,-0.4939
