The Guardian,David Nicholls: ‘I’m genuinely deathly at a dinner party’,"The bestselling author on why he finds it easier to be funny on the page, being inspired by Sue Townsend and Victoria Wood, and his struggle with the ending of You Are HereDavid Nicholls, 57, is a screenwriter and author whose six novels include Us, longlisted for the Booker prize in 2014, and the multimillion bestseller One Day (2009). His latest novel, You Are Here, is currently on the shortlist of the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse prize for comic fiction, the winner of which is announced on 2 December. The story of a divorced copy editor who meets a depressed geography teacher while on a hike across the north of England, it’s been praised by the New York Times as “an affectingly hard-won romance… sharp-tongued and irresistible, the most intelligent treat”.How did this book come together?
 I was going to write a big London novel, then lockdown happened and suddenly I didn’t know what a London novel would look like. Everyone was at home, anxious and distracted. I guess that planted the seed. I was aware of how much I missed the countryside, even though I’m a Londoner who’s never really lived in the countryside. I was aware how difficult it was for friends living alone, and I was aware how difficult communication was becoming. After lockdown, I found myself tongue-tied and awkward. So those were the strands: I wanted to dig into my craving for the countryside, I wanted to write about the benefits and demands of conversation, and I wanted to write about loneliness.Not to mention the enduring psychological impact of random street violence…
 That, again, seemed a tough subject to include in what is essentially a romantic comedy. I love London and I fight against its portrayal as somehow a place of no-go zones and constant threat – it really isn’t that. At the same time I’m aware of how a moment on the tube – a look, a remark – can flare up into something that can change the course of a life. It’s something I feel all the time in the city.Let’s make clear you’re up for a comic fiction award here.
 I know [laughs]. I’ve tried to write six comic novels now and this is the first time I’ve been nominated. There’s no contradiction between writing a comedy and writing something that’s about melancholy or depression or alcoholism. I guess this is just the first one where I’ve really tried very precisely on a line by line basis to make it funny.What’s involved in that?
 Chiselling away at the sentences and dialogue until they take it off me. I’d always love to do another draft post-publication. I don’t open the document that will be the novel until quite late; for a year I just scribble jokes and observations and character sketches and ideas for scenes in a big sketchbook. The first draft is always straining too much to be funny, a bit like someone trying too hard at a party. Continue reading...","Sat, 23 Nov 2024 18:00:03 GMT",0.0,0.9918

The Guardian,Schooled like Mourinho: Amorim’s path from pioneering Lisbon university,"Portugal’s coaches and players are all the rage in part thanks to links forged between academia and the gameThey always knew Ruben Amorim was a special one at the faculty of human kinetics. “I interviewed him for the course and from the start it was obvious,” says Prof António Veloso, José Mourinho’s former classmate, who runs the high-performance football coaching course at the faculty, which is affiliated to the University of Lisbon.“The students needed to do an essay on specialist topics and Ruben’s results were fantastic. He had a leadership role in the group. When we were doing tactical drills on the pitch all the other students were looking at Ruben’s and asking for his opinion. But he was very humble.” Continue reading...","Sat, 23 Nov 2024 22:00:04 GMT",0.3612,0.4215
The Guardian,Southampton are doomed but it’s clear why Russell Martin will not change | Jonathan Wilson,"Few managers are idealists but the truth for the man in charge at St Mary’s is that his players aren’t good enough to stay upThere has, at least, been a win to break the pattern. But Southampton’s victory over Everton was followed immediately by defeat by Wolves and so they spent the international break bottom of the table. They have taken four points from 11 games. In only two games this season have Southampton had the better xG – on the opening day, when they lost 1-0 at 10-man Newcastle, and in the 1-1 draw at Ipswich. They are, barring something miraculous, doomed.The routine has become familiar. Southampton play their goal-kicks short. They pass the ball neatly. They have a lot of possession; 56.6% – only three teams in the Premier League are averaging more. They don’t take their chances – no side have hit a lower percentage of shots on target this season. Somebody makes a mistake – perhaps one of their players, perhaps the referee – they concede and the game is lost. Continue reading...","Sat, 23 Nov 2024 20:00:01 GMT",0.2023,0.9319

The Guardian,Royale Pagaille makes hay in the Haydock mud to win Betfair Chase,"10-year-old wins for second year runningCharlie Deutsch’s mount edges out Grey DawningTime may show that Grey Dawning, the two-length runner-up, was the most talented horse in the Betfair Chase, but the grittiest and most indefatigable runner was undoubtedly Royale Pagaille, who simply refused to concede defeat after an extended three-mile trip on stamina-sapping ground. Little wonder then that behind his trademark Ray-Bans, Rich Ricci, Royale Pagaille’s owner, was more than a little emotional as he celebrated his 100th Grade One winner.A staying chase on deep ground at Haydock is one of the toughest tests that jumping can offer, and one that Venetia Williams’ 10-year-old has now passed five times in six attempts. It was a slow motion finish as Royale Pagaille responded to Charlie Deutsch’s final call to arms and hauled himself past Grey Dawning after jumping the last fence with a length to find, but all the more dramatic as a result, as the winner, who had led until after the second-last, clawed his way back.

In Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light, the latest BBC TV adaptation of Hilary Mantel’s Tudor novels, we see Henry VIII’s chief facilitator turn 21st-century empath, offering a listening ear to half the young women of the Henrician court.Mark Rylance, former artistic director of Shakespeare’s Globe, is an actor with an extraordinary capacity for vulnerability. Here he is at his best and most sympathetic. As Cromwell, we watch him safeguard the victimised adolescent Mary Tudor, coaching her to negotiate her way out of looming execution at the hands of her axe-happy father, Henry.

Inside the Trojan horse, say, with that Ancient Greek SAS unit bantering the day away, before busting out for their daring small-hours raid. Or inside the Jaguar marketing department, on the night before their new rebrand, as these crack experiential troops prepared to release this week’s new ad on an unsuspecting luxury car market. Picture the champagne corks popping as the socials are timed to post the video at the appointed hour. “I hope the pre-order guys are ready for an onslaught – because we’ve got eight capital-D diverse models in category-five tulle busting out of a pink-planet lift wielding a hammer – and precisely NO cars!

The Guardian,Benjamin Netanyahu is a wanted man – and he has only himself to blame | Jonathan Freedland,"A strategy of starvation would always be indefensible. After this week’s ICC decision, he risks turning Israel into a pariah stateThanks to Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel, which once dreamed of being a light unto the nations, has taken a step closer to becoming a leper among the nations. The Israeli prime minister and the defence minister he sacked a fortnight ago, Yoav Gallant, are now wanted men, the subject of arrest warrants issued on Thursday by the international criminal court (ICC), accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. From now on, some 124 countries are effectively closed to them: if Netanyahu or Gallant set foot in any member state of the ICC – which includes Britain and most of Europe – they face the risk of arrest. The UK government has already said it will follow the law, which sounds like a commitment to detain the two men if they come here. They are to be shunned, as a matter of international law.Israeli ministers and their allies are raging against the ICC, accusing it of bias and double standards in levelling against Israel charges that it has never made against the leaders of any other western democracy. But the blame lies squarely with Netanyahu himself. Because this move, which signals a new isolation of Israel, was entirely avoidable.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Art is better than this","The sale of Maurizio Cattelan’s work, Comedian, to a crypto entrepreneur is a grim concept that has little to do with disruptionPaulina Brandberg, the Swedish minister for gender equality and work life, has a phobia of bananas so severe, her aides check rooms for the fruit before she’s due to enter them. Like other sufferers of this most unlikely of conditions, she is triggered by the merest traces of banana: a skin mouldering in a far-off wastepaper basket; a lingering smell; the sense that until recently something bendy and yellow lurked next to the perfectly innocent apples and oranges in the bowl on that coffee&nbsp;table.We can only hope, then, that the minister was – trigger warning – nowhere near the big auction house news of last week, in which a banana sold for $5.2m (£4.1m) at Sotheby’s New York. This wasn’t, of course, any&nbsp;old banana. It was a banana called Comedian, the work of Maurizio Cattelan, an Italian visual&nbsp;artist. Cattelan describes it as&nbsp;a “sincere commentary on what&nbsp;we value”, which must have sounded a touch desperate until the moment when&nbsp;everyone started comparing its auction price with the&nbsp;cost of a banana down at their local Tesco.

The Guardian,The Observer view: ICC’s Israel arrest warrants are a test the world must not fail,"International criminal court’s intervention must be supported if global rules-based order is to have a meaningful futureThe decision by the international criminal court (ICC) to issue arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, and Yoav Gallant, Israel’s former defence minister, for alleged war crimes committed in Gaza has huge implications for Israel and Palestine, for international justice and the rules-based global order that the UK and its allies are pledged to uphold. This unprecedented, necessary and impartial supranational attempt to prosecute democratically elected western politicians accused of grievous wrongdoing is a test the international community dare not fail.Netanyahu’s reaction to the charges was to dismiss them as “absurd” and “antisemitic” and the ICC as a biased, politicised body. “No outrageous anti-Israel decision will prevent us – and it will not prevent me – from continuing to defend our country in every way,” he said. Netanyahu will have to do better than that. This case is not remotely about antisemitism. It’s not about Israel’s right to defend itself, which nobody disputes. It’s a matter of how it goes about it. It’s a question of impunity and justice. Netanyahu and Gallant should voluntarily surrender to the court and fight their case. Continue reading...","Sat, 23 Nov 2024 19:00:04 GMT",0.1154,-0.7072
The Guardian,Separating wheat from chaff in the farm tax debate | Letters,"Readers respond to an editorial about farmers having to pay inheritance tax when selling agricultural property priced at more than £1mWhile largely in agreement with the sentiments expressed in your editorial (The Guardian view on taxing farmers: big landowners must pay their share, 19 November), I believe there are some issues that need to be understood and addressed. I run a small-scale dairy farm in partnership with my son. We own just over 80 acres and rent another 40 acres annually. This allows us to have a herd of up to 80 milking cows but, despite misguided government assurances, leaves us now vulnerable to the new inheritance tax (IHT) proposals and will make our farm non-viable for the next generation.The average price of land in Northern Ireland is around £15,000 an acre and to maintain a dairy herd it is essential to upgrade facilities, machinery and the quality of livestock. This necessitates frequently borrowing money and results in very poor cashflow. Continue reading...","Fri, 22 Nov 2024 17:46:05 GMT",0.0,-0.8016

What does it mean for his legacy?René Magritte painted brain-teasers – an air force of uniformed bureaucrats raining down on to a faceless city, a reverse mermaid with a sardine for her head and human legs, a pair of boots that sport real toes – but even he might have scratched his head if he’d known that last week, after a frenetic bidding war at a New York auction, his Empire of Light had been knocked down for $121m.“It’s an iconic image,” declared the dealer, Emmanuel Di Donna, uttering an idiotic tautology, although the painting’s subject – a suburban villa beside a canal – looks humdrum enough until you notice that it’s night in the lower half but bright daylight higher up. Rather than accounting for the contradiction, Di Donna reverted to the lucre-loving lingo of the art market and attributed the record price to “the brand recognition of Magritte”.

The Guardian,‘The very thought of it repelled me’: how a skiing accident left me unable to read,"After suffering a head injury, I found I was unable to read without headaches, eye strain and wild mood swings – and that my condition was far from rareIn the Palazzo Pitti in Florence hangs a painting by Raphael of&nbsp;the Renaissance humanist, poet, scholar, orator and prelate Tommaso Inghirami. He’s pictured at his desk, garbed almost entirely in red, in a typical pose of contemplation, gazing upwards, but look closely at his right eye and you will notice something amiss: there is too much white, as if&nbsp;his&nbsp;eyeball were a shelled egg, its&nbsp;minute pupil dabbed as an afterthought. Inghirami lived with strabismus – a misalignment of the eyes, possibly caused by his fall from a&nbsp;mule – and his right eye is almost turned to look behind him, lizard-like. Were one to trace his gaze from those&nbsp;two eyes, extending outwards to&nbsp;see where he was looking, you would draw two lines into infinity, lines that would never cross. Inghirami&nbsp;saw two things at once.I had not heard of Inghirami and his misaligned eyes until I fell backwards – not from a mule, but in a skiing accident several years ago, cracking the back of my skull against the compact winter ice of a Vermont resort. I had played rugby until the age&nbsp;of 16, and knew how it felt to have a&nbsp;knee or elbow to the head, but this blow possessed its own character: unsettling, strange and electric.

Lenderman’s guitar work and reedy, laconic delivery, meanwhile, can lay claim to several fathers (Will Oldham, Stephen Malkmus) but ultimately sits at the feet of Neil Young.

Why was it important to give it a new audience now?
 That work is the only one I’ve ever written that I never allowed to be reprinted in book form. To put it another way, I just wasn’t satisfied with the story. I thought its theme was very important but unfortunately I lacked the writing skills at the time to convey it in the way I’d hoped to. I decided to bide my time, until I’d acquired the necessary skill set as a writer, and only then do a complete rewrite of the story.In the interim, though, I had lots of other work I wanted to undertake and just couldn’t get started on this project. The next thing I knew, 40 years had passed (in a flash, it seemed), and I reached my 70s. I thought I’d better get going if I wanted to really do this, since I might not have all that much time left.

The Guardian,‘Neutrality isn’t just a stance’: the Red Cross mission to provide vital aid in areas of conflict,"In conflict zones across the globe, people in desperate need have long relied on the hope that humanitarian aid, delivered by organisations such as the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, will reach them. Yet, this vital work is increasingly under threat, putting that hope in jeopardyWhen communities are devastated by conflict or disaster, humanitarian workers risk their lives to deliver critical aid. This work is safeguarded by international humanitarian law (IHL), which mandates protection for aid organisations to ensure they can operate safely. The red cross and red crescent emblems are some of the most well-known examples of the protective power of IHL in action, and respect for them is crucial to the humanitarian mission of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. However, a growing disregard for IHL is making it increasingly challenging for humanitarian organisations to deliver assistance to communities that urgently need it.Adopted under the Geneva Conventions, the red cross and red crescent emblems are protective symbols under IHL, meaning those who display one or the other can expect safe passage in the world’s most hostile environments. However, numerous breaches of IHL have made headlines in recent years, with strikes on vehicles, buildings, and individuals bearing one of the emblems provoking global condemnation and risking serious legal consequences.A Ukrainian Red Cross Society emergency team responds to shelling (top); the Italian Red Cross providing support in Ukraine.

The Guardian,10 things you didn’t know about the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement,"The Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement has been supporting people through conflicts, disasters and emergencies for more than 150 years. Read on to discover 10 inspiring facts about one of the world’s leading humanitarian organisationsThe Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement started with the creation of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 1863, in response to the terrible human toll of the revolutionary conflicts raging in Europe in the second half of the 19th century. Seven years later the British Red Cross was established. Today, the Movement is active in 191 countries and has been a constant and reassuring presence at some of the world’s most harrowing events: from being among the first to provide humanitarian support after the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945, to providing vital assistance to those affected by last year’s devastating earthquakes in Morocco, Turkey and Syria. You may know some of these facts, but did you know … 1 The Red Cross’s ‘red cross’ is not a logoEven though it is one of the most recognisable pieces of graphic design in the world, the red cross emblem is not just some clever bit of branding: it is a symbol of protection in armed conflict, the use of which is restricted by international law. The Red Cross’s guiding principles of neutrality and impartiality mean that it does not take sides and is here for anyone and everyone who needs help, regardless of religion, political affiliation or nationality or anything else.2 It’s the UK’s leading refugee support organisationThe British Red Cross is the largest independent provider of refugee support in the UK. In the last 12 months, the British Red Cross supported more than 40,000 refugees and people seeking asylum in the UK. ForFrom people who fled Afghanistan in 2021, to those affected by the crisis in Ukraine, the British Red Cross offers a variety of support including providing essential clothing and baby supplies to assisting people with visa applications, casework and translation.

But as the torrents of filthy water swept through towns and villages, people were left without electricity, food supplies – and drinking water. “It was brutal: cars, chunks of machinery, big stones, even dead bodies were swept along in the water. It gushed into the ground floor of buildings, into little shops, bakeries, hairdressers, the English school, bars: all were destroyed. This was climate change for real, climate change in capital letters,” says Josep de la Rubia of Valencia’s Ecologists in Action, describing the scene in the satellite towns south of the Valencian capital.In the aftermath, hundreds of thousands of people were reliant on emergency tankers of water or donations of bottled water from citizen volunteers. Within a fortnight, the authorities had reconnected the tap water of 90% of the 850,000 people in affected areas, but all were advised to boil it before drinking it or to use bottled water. Across the region, 100 sewage treatment plants were damaged; in some areas, human waste seeped into flood waters, dead animals were swept into rivers and sodden rubbish and debris piled up.

The Guardian,Experience: My dog went missing for nine years – then we were reunited,"Finally, they brought him out to me, wrapped in a blanket. He looked at me when I said his name. He tilted his head at the familiar sound before licking my nose in recognitionI knew Gizmo was the one the moment I laid eyes on him. It was October 2013, and Gizmo was a newborn chihuahua. He was hairless, with swollen eyelids, and the runt of the litter. I fell in love. Over the next couple of years, he was the perfect companion. Whether he was watching Grey’s Anatomy with me or licking my nose, Gizmo brought light to my life. I remember staring into his eyes – they were so distinct, with amber-coloured lines around the irises.Gizmo loved spending time with our terrier mix Benji and our chihuahua Chapo in our home in Las Vegas, but his best buddy was my mom. She wasn’t a&nbsp;dog person, but she adored Gizmo, and would spoil him with Mexican rice. Continue reading...","Fri, 22 Nov 2024 10:00:09 GMT",-0.296,0.9509

But it's not just in the US, some governments in other countries have launched marketing campaigns encouraging people to have more children, while others have offered financial incentives. But while many of these policies claim to be about halting population decline, there are other factors at play.

The Guardian,We shall satirise him on the beaches… Churchill through the eyes of cartoonists – in pictures,"In one wartime image, Winston Churchill is portrayed as a dragonslayer; in another, a gun-toting gangster. Later, he appears old and dejected, overdue for retirement. The cartoons, on show in a new exhibition at the Imperial War Museum London, show a multitude of Churchills, reflecting how he was seen in different countries and at different times, from 1909 onwards. “There was never a consensus view of him,” says curator Kate Clements. “Some of the depictions were heavily critical and even grotesque”, while others “depict his determined nature and portray him as a British figurehead”. Clements hopes the exhibition will “add another layer to our visitors’ understanding of this complex individual” and show “how satirical cartoons played a part in shaping perceptions of Churchill during his lifetime and beyond”.Churchill in Cartoons: Satirising a Statesman is at the Imperial War Museum, London from Friday to 23 February 2025 Continue reading...","Sat, 23 Nov 2024 17:00:02 GMT",0.0,-0.7717

They became the frame, leading the viewer to the scene. Meanwhile, the smoke rising, in combination with the setting sun and the remaining rays, created the most magical&nbsp;backdrop.” Continue reading...","Sat, 23 Nov 2024 10:00:39 GMT",0.6369,0.7269
