The Guardian,"Strange, surreal and sexy: 31 images that changed the way we see our bodies","From dancers to divas, amputees to activists: what images of the human form throughout the decades tell us about who we areThere is no image more compelling to us than to see another human being naked. Thouusands of years of evolution and desire, of empathy and curiosity, hardwire us to stare. The sight is visceral, electrifying, irresistible. It is familiar and forbidden; innocence and sin. The naked body is there in the bathroom mirror every morning, but to see another always feels like stumbling on a secret. A salt-twist of narcissism heightens our emotions, so that looking at a nude feels very different from admiring a watercolour landscape. Ethics come into it. In the history of portraiture, it is the nudes that are the most honest, or the most exploitative – or sometimes both.Photographs are part of the fabric of everyday life for all of us, in a way charcoal sketches or oil paintings are not. So when a nude is not a sketch or a painting but a photograph, the intensity ratchets up. The polite distance of the art gallery experience is stripped away, leaving gut reaction and raw emotion. All of which is to say: nothing like a nude photograph to get you by the jugular. Continue reading...","Sat, 01 Feb 2025 07:00:36 GMT",0.3818,0.8864

Instead it is the reigning champions, Ireland, who are up and running, courtesy of an uninterrupted blast of 22 second-half points that condemned Steve Borthwick’s side to a seventh defeat in their last nine Tests.Talk about a game of two contrasting halves. Initially a bristling England were right up for it and led 10-5 at the interval. They reckoned without storming, game-turning tries from Bundee Aki, Tadhg Beirne and Dan Sheehan and a collective Irish power surge that allowed the hosts to weather a slightly sticky first 40 minutes and grasp a potentially vital try bonus point.

The Guardian,Neymar heads home from £322m Saudi calamity still a prisoner of his potential | Jonathan Wilson,"Brazilian’s injury-blighted career highlights iniquities of the game, from inflated expectations to curse of celebrity excessNever go back, but sometimes going back is all that remains. Just 18 months after he joined Al-Hilal, Neymar and the Saudi club have agreed to terminate his contract, allowing him to return to Brazil and rejoin Santos. Al-Hilal paid £77m to sign Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain on a salary of £2.5m a week. He will be paid 85% of that for the remainder of this season, meaning he cost the club £322m for seven appearances, three assists and one goal. Like so much of Neymar’s career, it all seems such a dreadful waste.His is a story almost designed to highlight the iniquities of the modern game, from the impossible pressures placed on young players to the curse of celebrity and financial excess. Neymar’s great misfortune was to emerge just after Lionel Messi. Argentina had seemingly found a second Diego Maradona, so Brazil needed a second Pelé. When, in June 2011, the 19-year-old Neymar scored the opening goal in the final as Santos won the Copa Libertadores for the first time since Pelé had inspired them to the trophy in 1963, it seemed they had found him. But, of course, nobody can live with such comparisons and so Neymar remained always a prisoner of his potential. Continue reading...","Sat, 01 Feb 2025 20:00:51 GMT",-0.5423,0.5274

There have been very few games in which they’ve dismantled the opposition. They have won fewer league games by more than three goals than Tottenham have, but ended the day nine points clear at the top with their closest rivals to play the defending champions on Sunday. If Liverpool do, as they surely will, go on to win the title, it will have been an old-fashioned sort of success, a league won not by the spectacular or the flamboyant but by consistency and calmness, by ruthless accumulation.This was Liverpool’s sixth 2-0 win in the league; more than a quarter of their games so far. It’s a scoreline that speaks of control, of winning games with a little to spare, taking freakish equalisers, ill luck and odd refereeing decisions out of the equation, without being flashy and demanding overexertion: 2-0 is the scoreline of champions. Arsenal, like Liverpool, began the season with a pair of 2-0 wins but, since then, they have won 2-0 only once. Continue reading...","Sat, 01 Feb 2025 18:38:34 GMT",-0.4215,0.9962

And yet last Monday that’s what happened to Nvidia, the leading maker of electronic picks and shovels for the AI gold rush. It was the biggest one-day slump for any company in history, and it was not alone – shares of companies in semiconductor, power and infrastructure industries exposed to AI collectively shed more than $1tn in value on the same day.The proximate cause of this chaos was the news that a Chinese tech startup of whom few had hitherto heard had released DeepSeek R1, a powerful AI assistant that was much cheaper to train and operate than the dominant models of the US tech giants – and yet was comparable in competence to OpenAI’s o1 “reasoning” model. Just to illustrate the difference: R1 was said to have cost only $5.58m to build, which is small change compared with the billions that OpenAI and co have spent on their models; and R1 is about 15 times more efficient (in terms of resource use) than anything comparable made by Meta.

He will always exploit tragedy to display his self-regardOutrages of Donald Trump’s rancid character topple over each other so rapidly and in such volume that they long ago became banal. His vileness is unremarked upon, his rottenness unworthy of further commentary. Trump’s offensiveness is an unspoken assumption. Rules and norms exist for him to break. More, he is rewarded. Meta, after discarding monitoring of hateful content and disinformation on Facebook, is paying him $25m in tribute to settle his lawsuit against it for having banned him after his attempted coup on January 6 and his potential “instances of violence” and threats to “public safety”. All is forgiven, if not forgotten. There are no gates; there are no gatekeepers. Let the bad times roll.But Trump crashed through a new boundary after an army helicopter collided with an airliner about to land at Washington’s Reagan National airport on 29 January with the loss of 67 lives. While police and firefighters were still recovering bodies from the Potomac River, before any report from the National Transportation Safety Board and evidence was fully gathered, Trump went on TV to spew blame against enemies within and to deflect responsibility.

The Guardian,It's clear Britain can't survive without immigration. Now Labour must convince voters | Simon Jenkins,"Yet more evidence shows that we will only rely on it more as time goes on. It’s time to debate it without toxic rhetoricBritain needs immigrants. According to the Office for National Statistics this week, Britain’s “indigenous” population in the 2030s will be static and ageing. Growth in population will be buoyed only by immigrants, their number predicted to rise by 5 million over the next seven years. Thank goodness, surely, for them.As this debate lurches back into public discourse, it is cursed by the ease with which xenophobia delivers political gain. The fact is that Britons have turned massively in favour of immigration over the past half century. In the 1950s and 1960s, roughly 80%-90% wanted it to stop. Then the inflow was under 250,000 a year and Enoch Powell could forecast “rivers of blood”. Net migration was below zero.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Sat, 01 Feb 2025 10:00:39 GMT",0.5574,0.959
The Guardian,"The Observer view on Peter Mandelson’s U-turn on Donald Trump: it’s easy to mock, but that’s diplomacy | Observer editorial","It’s not often politicians admit to a change of heart. Perhaps it’s a trend that could – and should – catch onIn his new book, Changing My Mind, Julian Barnes writes: “We always believe changing our mind is an improvement, bringing a greater truthfulness to our dealings with the world and other people. It puts an end to vacillation, uncertainty, weak-mindedness. It seems to make us stronger and more mature.”Well, maybe in literature, but not in politics, where changing your mind is akin to changing your underwear in public. Not a sign of strength, but a cause for embarrassment. There are few scenes of schadenfreude more keenly savoured in the political world than a dramatic U-turn, ideally with handbrake fully engaged and wheels loudly screeching.

When the meeting was set last year, few expected US aggression toward a European nation to be on the agenda. But initial incredulity at Donald Trump’s bellicose claims on Greenland, a Danish territory, has been followed by shocked expressions of solidarity with Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen. A bullying 45-minute phone call between Mr Trump and Ms Frederiksen was described as “horrendous”.So it begins. As Europe reacquaints itself with Mr&nbsp;Trump’s aggressive “America First” brand of diplomacy, further such provocations can be guaranteed. Fighting talk emanating from the White House will sometimes be a prelude to eventual compromise. But there can be&nbsp;no doubt that the challenges raised by the president’s second coming are&nbsp;substantial and wide-ranging.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The room is empty save for a jug of water, some makeup and hairdressing equipment and, on the floor, a wonderfully garish pair of red patent leather platform shoes.Atwell will be wearing them as Beatrice, who she plays opposite Tom Hiddleston’s Benedick. “They’re my dancing shoes,” she says when she arrives. “Every morning at 11 the shoes go on and we dance [as part of rehearsal for the show]. It’s expressive, it’s modern but not at all gimmicky.” It turns out dancing in front of an audience is a first for her. Is she out of her comfort zone? “Actually no. The giddy freeness of it is more in keeping with who I am. It’s certainly not like the period dramas I’ve done, or all the serious stuff.

The Guardian,Colin Barrett: ‘My wife is astonished that I’m able to write’,"The award-winning author on his move from short stories to novels, writing marginal characters in small-town Mayo and the Irish fiction he rates mostBorn in Canada in 1982, Colin Barrett was raised near Ballina, County Mayo, and though he left as a teenager, studying creative writing at University College Dublin, Mayo has provided the setting for almost all his writing to date. His debut short story collection, Young Skins, came out in 2013, winning the Guardian first book award and yielding a film adaptation, Calm With Horses, starring Cosmo Jarvis and Barry Keoghan. He followed it with the 2022 collection Homesickness and last year’s Booker-longlisted novel Wild Houses, which revolves around a poorly-planned kidnapping in Ballina. Winner of the Nero debut fiction award, it is now out in paperback. Barrett lives in Dublin with his wife and two children.What sparked Wild Houses?The first scene I wrote was the opening one. Dev Hendrick wakes up in the middle of night and there’s a car outside. Two men bring a teenage boy to the door. The men turn out to be Dev’s criminal cousins and Doll, the boy, is a bargaining chip in a haphazard blackmailing scheme. What attracted me was writing from the perspective of Dev, who is on the periphery. I was very taken with that situation, where a passive and withdrawn character is pushed right up against this dramatic and potentially traumatic event.

In his early teens, their son Louis, now 22, a talented artist and musician, began to have epileptic seizures that wiped out his memories of childhood; some of these were of the type nicknamed “Alice in Wonderland” syndrome because of the resulting misperceptions of time and space – though these were scary, oppressive and brutal experiences very different from the beguiling world of Lewis Carroll.

It means January is over, which is cause for celebration already. The end-of-season sale rails have gone, so shop windows are again a source of new ideas. The weather is still rubbish, obviously, but the light is coming back: with a pinch of luck, you may even see daylight on the way home from the office by the end of February. The first snowdrops are nearly here. I like Valentine’s Day, which I know is deeply uncool of me, but I like pink and I like chocolate, so what’s not to love?But February can be a challenge to dress for. The novelty of snuggly knits and shiny boots has well and truly worn off at this point, and maintaining enthusiasm for cold-weather dressing is a chore. Please keep reading for a puffer coat update and a fresh layering formula, not to mention a top-tier edit of the most delectable and affordable treats I’ve scouted from February’s shelves. No time to waste, my friends: another good thing about February is that it’s only 28 days long. Let’s hear it for a month that’s not just short, but also surprisingly sweet.

The Guardian,The food filter: which supermarket has the best extra-virgin olive oil?,"From luxury Sicilian to budget buys, our Rome correspondent tests supermarket extra-virgin olive oils – and reveals how much you should spend• The best hot sauces, tasted and rated by Thomasina MiersYears ago, a good cook, who happened to be Greek, told me to think of olive oil not simply as liquid fat, but as an essential ingredient, as flavour and as a seasoning, with the ability to act like herbs and spices. He’s absolutely right and his excellent advice continues to motivate me when I’m choosing extra-virgin olive oil, which is the single most important ingredient I buy, and my biggest expense in the kitchen. While I do have the odd special bottle for drizzling, I am more interested in a good-tasting all-rounder that I can use for everything (my cooking is largely vegetable-, pasta-, pulse-, cheese- and egg-centric), including deep-frying (in a very small pan).Just to recap, olive oil is the liquid fat obtained by pressing olives, which are fruits. Once picked, they need to be processed as soon as possible – that is, crushed, then centrifugally spun to separate the pulp, water and oil, all in scrupulously clean machinery and at a steady temperature, which preserves the natural aromas of the olives. It takes about eight kilos of olives to make a litre of oil, which, to be considered extra-virgin olive oil, needs to have no defects and no more than 0.8% of free fatty acids. And that comes at a price: expect to pay between £14 and £18 a litre. Continue reading...","Sat, 01 Feb 2025 10:00:39 GMT",0.6369,0.9847
