I said: ‘You what?’ ‘He sits there with a stopwatch.’ I have no idea if this is true, but he says: ‘He’s worked out that in this season you have had this amount of screen time and if it were a title race you are only a few points off where he is.’ So the guy says: ‘So watch yourself.’ Next thing I know, I was dragged into [executive producer] Jon Bentley’s office.

The cockiness that helped make his name is far less apparent. As a presence, he seems much more engaging than he did in his heyday. You suspect this is no comfort.Still, he is the reason we’re watching Loaded: Lads, Mags and Mayhem, a 90-minute documentary telling the story of how he and a group of other hedonists with a gonzo gift “committed”, as Brown puts it at the start of the show, “the heinous crime of getting men to read magazines en masse”.

The Guardian,Only Child review – this bittersweet comedy is absolutely packed with laughs,"There’s nothing hugely original about this sitcom about a son and father reconnecting. But it’s laugh-out-loud funny thanks to the gag-dense script and a stellar performance from Rab C Nesbitt’s Gregor FisherI laughed out loud five times during the first three minutes of Only Child, which stars Greg McHugh as a semi-successful actor who returns to his home town to look after his ailing dad (Gregor Fisher). That’s probably the highest compliment you can pay the opening episode of a new sitcom – but it’s also the only feasible way to sell this series: there isn’t anything remotely original or different about this doggedly conventional comedy. Set in Forres, a sleepy town in the north of Scotland, the show is geriatric in pace and content; a gentle, bittersweet exploration of midlife’s handbrake turn, when children start parenting their own parents. And yet Bryce Hart’s script is meticulously dense with gags, delivered with exemplary timing by its two leads. In other words, it’s pretty funny.We begin with McHugh’s Richard arriving home for a flying visit; he doesn’t have long before he must journey back south to film the latest series of his cosy police procedural Detective Manners (he plays Doctor Sparrow, whose imperfect grasp of basic medical principles enrages the local GP). But he doesn’t even make it out of the station before his dad is on the phone, pestering him for help with his iPad. The tech-literacy generation gap is a groan-worthy subject at this stage, but Ken’s gruff reaction to his tablet-based confusion (the iPad in question is actually the kitchen scales) sells the joke. Then we’re promptly whisked off to the funeral of a man Ken can’t stand (Richard: “Why are we here?” Ken: “Well it’s a social contract – you go to someone’s funeral, they come to yours.” Richard: “Not if they’re dead … ”).

F1, which promotes the race, has spent a fortune on establishing it perhaps as the most striking example of turning a race weekend into an event. Each one a Super Bowl was the grand ambition when Liberty Media took over the sport in 2017 with races in “destination cities” and in Las Vegas it has that and the potential spectacle to match with a world champion ready to cash out again in Nevada.

The Guardian,Benjamin Netanyahu is a wanted man – and he has only himself to blame | Jonathan Freedland,"A strategy of starvation would always be indefensible. After this week’s ICC decision, he risks turning Israel into a pariah stateThanks to Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel, which once dreamed of being a light unto the nations, has taken a step closer to becoming a leper among the nations. The Israeli prime minister and the defence minister he sacked a fortnight ago, Yoav Gallant, are now wanted men, the subject of arrest warrants issued on Thursday by the international criminal court (ICC), accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. From now on, some 124 countries are effectively closed to them: if Netanyahu or Gallant set foot in any member state of the ICC – which includes Britain and most of Europe – they face the risk of arrest. The UK government has already said it will follow the law, which sounds like a commitment to detain the two men if they come here. They are to be shunned, as a matter of international law.Israeli ministers and their allies are raging against the ICC, accusing it of bias and double standards in levelling against Israel charges that it has never made against the leaders of any other western democracy. But the blame lies squarely with Netanyahu himself. Because this move, which signals a new isolation of Israel, was entirely avoidable.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"Spending time with people in their final days showed me that we need not assisted dying, but better end-of-life care | Gordon Brown","With investment in palliative care, we can improve on our current end-of-life options – ‘Switzerland, suicide or suffering’Gordon Brown is the UN’s special envoy for global education and was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Report: Gordon Brown says daughter’s death showed value of ‘good’ dying over assisted dyingJennifer, the baby daughter my wife Sarah brought into the world a few days after Christmas 2001, died after only 11 days. By day four, when the extent of her brain haemorrhage had been diagnosed, we were fully aware that all hope was gone and that she had no chance of survival. We could only sit with her, hold her tiny hand and be there for her as life ebbed away. She died in our arms. But those days we spent with her remain among the most precious days of my and Sarah’s lives. The experience of sitting with a fatally ill baby girl did not convince me of the case for assisted dying; it convinced me of the value and imperative of good end-of-life care.We were reassured that she was not in pain. At the heart of the debate on assisted dying is our desire to prevent suffering. Almost every family is able to talk from firsthand experience of heartbreaking moments when they want to do their best by their parents, grandparents or mortally ill children – and then feel they have failed. Our sympathies naturally flow to those fatally sick patients we know who themselves fear the suffering that lies ahead of them and losing control over their final months, days, or even hours.Gordon Brown is the UN’s special envoy for global education and was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Inside the Trojan horse, say, with that Ancient Greek SAS unit bantering the day away, before busting out for their daring small-hours raid. Or inside the Jaguar marketing department, on the night before their new rebrand, as these crack experiential troops prepared to release this week’s new ad on an unsuspecting luxury car market. Picture the champagne corks popping as the socials are timed to post the video at the appointed hour. “I hope the pre-order guys are ready for an onslaught – because we’ve got eight capital-D diverse models in category-five tulle busting out of a pink-planet lift wielding a hammer – and precisely NO cars! Let’s make some sales history!”Anyhow. Arguably it’s gone slightly worse than the wooden horse, which, when you think about it, was one of the most successful high performance vehicles in history/mythology.

Their little inheritors on toy tractors could hardly have offered a better portrait of a Britain where even modest reforms of wildly irrational tax reliefs are near-impossible. The country loves Old MacDonald and detests IHT.This is a symbol of the great malaise those same contrary voters feel about the profound unfairness in this most unequal of countries.

The Guardian,The Guardian view of global justice at a crossroads: war crimes demand accountability | Editorial,"The ICC’s arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders challenge decades of impunity, testing global resolve to uphold international justiceThe arrest warrants from the international criminal court (ICC) for the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the defence minister Yoav Gallant, and the Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, represent a historic milestone in the fight for accountability over war crimes. Hamas’s October massacre of 1,200 Israelis was a shocking violation of international humanitarian law, justifying prosecution. However, with many of Hamas’s senior commanders killed in Israeli military strikes, courtroom justice may remain elusive.For Israel’s leadership, the ICC’s action ends decades of perceived impunity and challenges what critics describe as Israel’s longstanding “shield of immunity”. There were predictable reactions: Mr Netanyahu condemned the ICC’s decision as “antisemitic”, while Hamas praised the warrants against Israel’s leaders as an “important historical precedent”. The ICC’s jurisdiction over Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem provides the legal foundation for this bold step. Yet, the real test of these warrants lies with the ICC’s 124 member states, which are legally obliged to arrest the accused and transfer them to The Hague. Failure to act would expose international law as a facade, undermining its credibility and allowing powerful nations and their allies to trample justice with impunity. Enforcing these warrants is not just a legal obligation – it is a moral imperative to uphold the principle that no leader is above the law.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on 30 years of the national lottery: winners and losers | Editorial,"From the Angel of the North to the Eden Project, it has transformed the UK’s cultural landscape. But public funding for the arts is still neededThe year 1994 was a big one for British culture. Four Weddings and a Funeral smashed box-office records, Oasis’s Definitely Maybe became the fastest-selling debut album in British musical history up to then, and you could board the Eurostar for Paris. But for all the buzz of Cool Britannia, arguably the most far-reaching cultural event was the launch of the national lottery. On 19 November, 22 million people tuned in to the BBC to watch Noel Edmonds draw the first winning numbers. “It could be you!’ seemed an apt slogan for a more optimistic era.Margaret Thatcher had “disapproved” of lotteries. Set up by her successor, John Major, the national lottery has funded more than 700,000 projects across community, heritage, sport and the arts in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This week it announced that it has raised £50bn “for good causes”. From Billy Elliot to the Royal Ballet, and Antony Gormley’s Angel of the North to the Eden Project in Cornwall, the national lottery has transformed the cultural landscape of the UK.

The Guardian,Separating wheat from chaff in the farm tax debate | Letters,"Readers respond to an editorial about farmers having to pay inheritance tax when selling agricultural property priced at more than £1mWhile largely in agreement with the sentiments expressed in your editorial (The Guardian view on taxing farmers: big landowners must pay their share, 19 November), I believe there are some issues that need to be understood and addressed. I run a small-scale dairy farm in partnership with my son. We own just over 80 acres and rent another 40 acres annually. This allows us to have a herd of up to 80 milking cows but, despite misguided government assurances, leaves us now vulnerable to the new inheritance tax (IHT) proposals and will make our farm non-viable for the next generation.The average price of land in Northern Ireland is around £15,000 an acre and to maintain a dairy herd it is essential to upgrade facilities, machinery and the quality of livestock. This necessitates frequently borrowing money and results in very poor cashflow. Continue reading...","Fri, 22 Nov 2024 17:46:05 GMT",0.0,-0.8016

The Guardian,Dawns y Ceirw review – the dance of the inquisitive reindeer,"Dance House, CardiffA lonely deer enters a world of natural wonders in this dance-theatre show for children, with spellbinding songs by Casi WynNever mind poor red-nosed Rudolph being called names, here’s a reindeer with a really raw deal. This Welsh-language dance-theatre show for children (recommended for ages five to nine) introduces the woefully cold and lonely Carw on Christmas Eve. With no companions, and the lights in the nearby village turned off, he follows a mysterious spark and trots tentatively into a dark forest. Fear not: Carw encounters mild danger but mostly abundant wonder, rendered with carefully calibrated stagecraft and warm performances. If you ever saw this, you might even say it glows.The script and spellbinding songs are by Casi Wyn, former Welsh-language children’s poet laureate, and based on the 2020 animated short of the same name (the title translates as Dance of the Deer). Wyn narrates and sings, sporting a jolly, Santa-esque pink costume with woolly trim; her storytelling piques the audience’s curiosity and she has the right tone for fairytale suspense. There are folkloric elements in her natural world of a valley-cradle, an awakening forest and an “orchestra of creatures” playing hide and seek.

The Guardian,‘Neutrality isn’t just a stance’: the Red Cross mission to provide vital aid in areas of conflict,"In conflict zones across the globe, people in desperate need have long relied on the hope that humanitarian aid, delivered by organisations such as the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, will reach them. Yet, this vital work is increasingly under threat, putting that hope in jeopardyWhen communities are devastated by conflict or disaster, humanitarian workers risk their lives to deliver critical aid. This work is safeguarded by international humanitarian law (IHL), which mandates protection for aid organisations to ensure they can operate safely. The red cross and red crescent emblems are some of the most well-known examples of the protective power of IHL in action, and respect for them is crucial to the humanitarian mission of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. However, a growing disregard for IHL is making it increasingly challenging for humanitarian organisations to deliver assistance to communities that urgently need it.Adopted under the Geneva Conventions, the red cross and red crescent emblems are protective symbols under IHL, meaning those who display one or the other can expect safe passage in the world’s most hostile environments. However, numerous breaches of IHL have made headlines in recent years, with strikes on vehicles, buildings, and individuals bearing one of the emblems provoking global condemnation and risking serious legal consequences.A Ukrainian Red Cross Society emergency team responds to shelling (top); the Italian Red Cross providing support in Ukraine.

The Guardian,10 things you didn’t know about the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement,"The Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement has been supporting people through conflicts, disasters and emergencies for more than 150 years. Read on to discover 10 inspiring facts about one of the world’s leading humanitarian organisationsThe Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement started with the creation of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 1863, in response to the terrible human toll of the revolutionary conflicts raging in Europe in the second half of the 19th century. Seven years later the British Red Cross was established. Today, the Movement is active in 191 countries and has been a constant and reassuring presence at some of the world’s most harrowing events: from being among the first to provide humanitarian support after the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945, to providing vital assistance to those affected by last year’s devastating earthquakes in Morocco, Turkey and Syria. You may know some of these facts, but did you know … 1 The Red Cross’s ‘red cross’ is not a logoEven though it is one of the most recognisable pieces of graphic design in the world, the red cross emblem is not just some clever bit of branding: it is a symbol of protection in armed conflict, the use of which is restricted by international law. The Red Cross’s guiding principles of neutrality and impartiality mean that it does not take sides and is here for anyone and everyone who needs help, regardless of religion, political affiliation or nationality or anything else.2 It’s the UK’s leading refugee support organisationThe British Red Cross is the largest independent provider of refugee support in the UK. In the last 12 months, the British Red Cross supported more than 40,000 refugees and people seeking asylum in the UK. ForFrom people who fled Afghanistan in 2021, to those affected by the crisis in Ukraine, the British Red Cross offers a variety of support including providing essential clothing and baby supplies to assisting people with visa applications, casework and translation.

Here’s how you can initiate yourself into the leguminati.
 “We don’t soak our beans, because they’re so fresh they don’t need it,” says Steve Sando, the founder of the California-based bean company, Rancho Gordo.Sando has been working for years to promote enthusiasm and love for pulses which can – he believes – save the world (or at least make us all healthier and reduce the amount of carbon emissions our food systems produce.

The Guardian,Armagnac: the secret bargain of the spirit world,"Armagnac, cognac’s less-celebrated cousin, boasts big, irresistible, fruity flavours, and gives you much more bang for your buckThe seemingly staid world of armagnac was well and truly disrupted earlier this year by the arrival of a brand called Hogsworth that blends bourbon whiskey with brandy from Gascony. It’s the creation of American entrepreneur Raj Bhakta, who in 2020 began buying up aged armagnac, and the name is a mischievous dig at his former company WhistlePig, a rye whiskey distiller in Vermont that he left in 2019. As you can imagine, Bhakta has ruffled a few feathers by combining rare 42-year-old brandies with young bourbons – and that’s even before we get on to the accompanying sales pitch video, which can only be described as Trumpian.Dog’s dinner or pig’s ear, the idea behind Hogsworth does point to something interesting going on in the spirits world: mature whisky, be it single malt scotch or bourbon, can be extremely valuable. Armagnac, by contrast, isn’t. If you’re looking for a 40th birthday present, you could buy, say, a 1984 Delord armagnac for £125.65 (from Brandy Classics, 40%), or you could go very large indeed and splash out nearly £5,000 on a bottle of Glenfarclas Winter Cask 1984 (Master of Malt, 47.1%).
