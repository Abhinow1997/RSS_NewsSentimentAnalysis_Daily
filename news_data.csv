The Guardian,Lend me your ears: great Shakespearean actors given hi-tech talking portraits,"A radical new exhibition celebrates stars including Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart by combining subtly moving artworks with their own voices. The results are uncannyGreat actors have always attracted artists. I think of Edmund Kean looking wild-eyed and demonic as Sir Giles Overreach painted by George Clint; Ellen Terry as a green-gowned Lady Macbeth preserved by John Singer Sargent; and Ruskin Spear’s study in oils of Laurence Olivier as a tormented, guilt-haunted Macbeth. For well over a century, it has also been possible to record the voices of our leading actors. But what would happen if image and sound were combined?One answer is to be found in a radical new exhibition called The Shakespeare Portraits on view at the Red Eight Gallery, which can be found in the City of London’s Cornhill alongside the Royal Exchange. The show consists of 10 digital portraits of living actors accompanied by speeches from Shakespeare plays. I can best explain by example. I sat beneath a large, framed image of Ian McKellen and as I spoke to the exhibition’s creative director, Arsalan Sattari-Hicks, I realised that Sir Ian’s head was occasionally moving, that his gaze was subtly shifting and his features expressing a variety of emotions. At one point I even heard him speaking a fragment of “All the world’s a stage” from As You Like It with characteristic virtuosity. Richard Brierley, the gallery’s director, put it succinctly when he told me: “Normally the portrait is passive and you are the active one. In this case the portrait is active and you are passive.” Continue reading...","Mon, 18 Nov 2024 12:46:53 GMT",0.6249,0.9869

ChatGPT’s developer, OpenAI, said Sky was “a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice”, but it pulled the voice “out of respect for Ms Johansson”.

The last major reform to policing in the 1960s modernised our service in ways we at one time would not have thought possible, and in ways that felt cutting edge at the time. We slimmed down from a staggering 200 police forces in Britain in 1900 to 43 in England and Wales after 1964, simplifying a fragmented landscape.That was in the pre-internet era, when the handheld calculator was the height of innovation. Crime has evolved dramatically since then, and we now face new threats such as fraud, riots and terrorism, which are growing in prevalence and complexity. What an officer would have been called to do in the 1960s is vastly different to the typical calls we get now. There was no searching on “the cloud” to find evidence, or even DNA to collect at a crime scene. The policing model was built to respond to “traditional” crime, such as burglary and theft, that happened in communities.Gavin Stephens is chair of the National Police Chiefs’ CouncilDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I pictured plummy English or haughty southern Irish accents with a few mangled Belfast “nowwws” thrown in for colour.On reflection this wasn’t really to do with the book, a sober and well-researched account of a brutal murder.

Give me a holiday, give me Campari, give me a soft, happy bodySupport for seasonal self-love comes from an unexpected quarter: the French daily Libération has issued a plea for us to embrace our “winter buddy”.

The article conjures a wild, wish-fulfilled universe, in which having a bit of solstice padding makes you sexually irresistible rather than drawing barbed comments from your mother-in-law.

The Guardian,Uncommitted achieved its goal in making Gaza a mainstream issue | Camonghne Felix,"The movement seeking to confront US responsibility in Israel’s war by withholding votes offered Americans moral clarityIn the days following the 2024 election, a cadre of pundits have been eager to call the uncommitted voters’ impact on the presidential race both a failure and a significant factor in Vice-President Kamala Harris’s loss. Despite those contradicting analyses, the movement’s success lies not in its voter count, but rather in the clarity it offered voters, even those who changed their minds and chose to vote for Harris in the end.As with the anti-war campaigns of the 1960s, the Uncommitted National Movement, the more than 500,000-person effort which called on Americans against the genocide in Gaza to withhold their votes, was a representation of the nation’s shifting consciousness around US responsibility in Israel’s war. By asking the public to confront imperialism, the movement opened the door to a confrontation between the people and the Democratic party, awakening its voters to an issue once seen as someone else’s concern.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on a genocide probe call: sense in Gaza’s senseless conflict | Editorial,"The pope’s call to investigate war crimes in Gaza highlights rising global scrutiny. But accountability remains elusiveAs an Israeli airstrike killed at least 30 people in a northern Gaza residential block, Pope Francis called for an investigation into whether genocide is being carried out under the cover of war. The staggering death toll in Gaza – an estimated 44,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children – underscores the urgency of his call for accountability. While the pope has criticised Israel’s war before, this marks his first public call for a deeper investigation of the conflict ignited by Hamas’s 7 October attack last year that killed 1,200 people. Legal scrutiny of the conflict requires access to Gaza, which has been sealed off for 13 months in defiance of the the international court of justice’s calls to permit entry to investigate a “plausible genocide”.The pope did not give a definitive judgment on whether the situation legally qualifies as the “crime of crimes”. Others, including noted scholars, have been less circumspect. A UN committee last week said that Israel’s actions in Gaza fit the definition of genocide, with widespread civilian deaths and harsh conditions deliberately forced on Palestinians. However, while the UN plainly stating its case might feel satisfying, it could backfire by further angering Israelis. Continue reading...","Mon, 18 Nov 2024 19:34:10 GMT",-0.3182,-0.9947
The Guardian,The Guardian view on children’s homes: cap profits and don’t stop there | Editorial,"Private sector reform is overdue, but councils need funding if young people are to have the chances they deserveCurbs on profiteering in the children’s social care sector cannot come soon enough. It is getting on for three years since the Competition and Markets Authority found that children’s home owners in England, Scotland and Wales were making excessive profits while carrying too much debt – exposing children and councils to unacceptable risks. Of all the failed experiments in privatisation of the past 30 years, this has a case to be considered the worst. A situation in which children are regularly uprooted from their areas due to services having been shaped by market forces – rather than their needs – should never have been allowed.Bridget Phillipson’s announcement on Monday that the government will seek to limit the profits of providers in England, and restrict the use of agency social workers to promote a more stable workforce, was the clearest indication so far of the direction that government reforms will take (children’s social care is devolved, and the Scottish and Welsh governments are pursuing their own plans). Ofsted will gain new powers to issue fines and inspect chains as well as individual homes. Providers will be obliged to be more transparent about their finances.

My&nbsp;entire training has been centred on preserving life. During the ongoing deliberations, decision-makers must consider several critical points carefully.First, advancements in medicine have enabled patients with severe illnesses to live longer, often through supportive and definitive therapies that slow disease progression, prioritising life preservation over hastening death.

The Guardian,A price worth paying for a dignified death | Letters,"Anne Heaton, Elsbeth Christie and Emma Tait react to the health secretary’s warning that legalising assisted dying would divert funds from the NHSI thought the vote on assisted dying was to be according to MPs’ consciences and that the government wasn’t taking a side. How is it, then, that Wes Streeting is making his views prominent and using his position as health secretary to suggest the NHS will be adversely affected by a vote in favour (Legalisation of assisted dying may force NHS cuts, Wes Streeting warns, 13 November)? I don’t believe that is true, and in any case it is irrelevant. People should have a choice at the end of their lives, even if there is a cost to the NHS. To deny that is simply cruel. Maybe he should talk to a wider range of dying and elderly people to discover their reality.Anne HeatonAshby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire• As one who never wants palliative care, no matter how wonderfully administered it may be, I really take issue with Wes Streeting’s suggestion that assisted dying would be too expensive and would require cuts to other services – which is what his pronouncement boils down to.

The Guardian,Andy Robertson’s late header in Poland gifts Scotland Nations League lifeline,"Scotland had contributed far too much to the Nations League to finish bottom of Group A1. That was the harsh reality until Andy Robertson leapt like a Loch Tay salmon to meet John Souttar’s superb stoppage-time cross, securing a famous win over Poland with a bullet header which rendered Lukasz Skorupski helpless. Steve Clarke’s team live on, courtesy of a playoff berth. The scale of jubilation which greeted Robertson’s winner told any onlooker how much that means.“We want to go to another tournament,” Clarke said afterwards. “The playoff in March to stay at the highest level of the Nations League will set us up for a tough World Cup qualifying campaign. We are ready for it.” When John McGinn sent Scotland ahead, thoughts were of another outcome. Had the result gone their way between Croatia and Portugal, it was conceivable Clarke’s men could finish second. Ultimately that other tie was immaterial but this one was not. Scotland and their support celebrated in epic style courtesy of Robertson’s late intervention, which instead sends Poland into the second tier. Their coach, Michal Probierz, may pay for that with his job. Continue reading...","Mon, 18 Nov 2024 21:50:34 GMT",0.0,0.9638

The Guardian,What do the weekend’s attendances tell us after WSL took centre stage? | Suzanne Wrack,"The upward curve in crowds has flattened slightly but the overall trajectory is looking healthy for the women’s gameThere was apprehension among home supporters at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday. A fear of defeat, a regret that this fixture, the north London derby, was not being played a month earlier when Arsenal were limping towards the exit of Jonas Eidevall as manager. The mood was up too; 28,852 fans were in attendance and in good spirits, regardless of the result they may have expected.That’s only 46% of the stadium’s capacity but it felt comfortably full, the lower tier packed and a spray of fans extending into the upper. The large pocket of Arsenal followers in the corner were in full voice, scarves spinning, a block of red and white set against the deep blue and white around them. It was a normal matchday, the rivalry there, but as with most women’s football matches there was a family-friendly feel. It’s not manufactured – it doesn’t need to be. It is just a natural consequence of cheaper tickets that would likely extend to men’s matches if people could afford to take their families.

The Guardian,Rachel Roddy’s recipe for cauliflower polpette with cheese sauce | A kitchen in Rome,"Cauliflower may just be an inhibited cabbage, but it really comes to life in these crunchy, breadcrumbed cheeseballsThe other day, we walked past a field of cauliflower in the green belt of Rome called Casaletto. Not that it was clear they were cauliflowers to begin with, so tight were the pale green leaves protecting most of the heads, although a few were visible, staring out like ghostly white faces. In her Vegetable Book, Jane Grigson describes seeing a man near the city of Nicosia in Cyprus carrying a cauliflower so big that he couldn’t get his arm around it. It’s a shame she never met Peter Glazebrook of Halam in Nottinghamshire, who in 2014 entered the Guinness World Records with his 27.48kg cauliflower.The cauliflower is a variety of the common cabbage with arrested inflorescence. That is to say, a cabbage whose flowers were starting to form, but got interrupted at the bud stage, resulting in dense “curds”, which are most commonly white, but can also be luminous green, purple, orange, yellow and brown. Broccoli is arrested in much the same way, and I can’t help but feel a little sorry for both inhibited vegetables. Continue reading...","Mon, 18 Nov 2024 11:00:07 GMT",0.0,-0.7821
