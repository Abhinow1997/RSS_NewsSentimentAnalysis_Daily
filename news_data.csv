The Guardian,"Ukraine war briefing: Kyiv ready to swap North Korean soldiers for Ukrainian PoWs, Zelenskyy says","Ukrainian president says there ‘should be no doubt left’ that Russia is dependent on military assistance from North Korea. What we know on day 1,055See all our Ukraine coverageUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday he was ready to hand over captured North Korean soldiers to Pyongyang in exchange for the return of Ukrainian prisoners of war held in Russia. Zelenskyy’s offer came hours after South Korea’s National Intelligence Service confirmed Ukraine’s announcement from the previous day that it had captured two North Korean soldiers.In a post on X Sunday, Zelenskyy said: “Ukraine is ready to hand over Kim Jong-un’s soldiers to him if he can organise their exchange for our warriors who are being held captive in Russia.” There would “undoubtedly be more” North Korean soldiers captured by Kyiv, he added. “There should be no doubt left in the world that the Russian army is dependent on military assistance from North Korea.”One of the men said he wanted to return to North Korea while the other said he wanted to remain in Ukraine, according to translated comments from a video of the two men’s interrogations posted by Zelenskyy. “For those North Korean soldiers who do not wish to return, there may be other options available,” said Zelenskyy. “In particular, those who express a desire to bring peace closer by spreading the truth about this war in Korean will be given that opportunity.”The soldiers are the first captive North Koreans to survive. They represent a PR opportunity for Kyiv, during a precarious moment for Ukraine as Donald Trump returns to the White House. Zelenskyy is keen to emphasise that Ukraine is fighting an unprecedented coalition of malign autocratic states. One is North Korea, which has supplied Moscow with short-range ballistic missiles, artillery shells and – since last November – about 10,000 elite troops.Swedish prime minister Ulf Kristersson said that his country was neither at war nor at peace as he announced that Sweden would be sending armed forces into the Baltic Sea for the first time as part of increased surveillance efforts amid a spate of suspected sabotage of undersea cables. The country announced it will contribute up to three warships and a surveillance aircraft to a Nato effort to monitor critical infrastructure and Russia’s “shadow fleet” as the alliance tries to guard against sabotage of underwater infrastructure.Russia on Sunday claimed the capture of two villages in eastern Ukraine where its forces have been steadily advancing for months. The defence ministry said forces had captured the village of Yantarne in the eastern Donetsk region, around 10km (six miles) southwest of Kurakhove, a key logistics hub that Moscow claimed to have seized last week. On Saturday, Russia’s army said it had also taken new territory northwest of Kurakhove. The defence ministry said Sunday that Russian troops had also captured the village of Kalinove in the northeastern Kharkiv region. The village is on the western bank of the Oskil River, which for a long time formed the front line between the two armies in the region.An emergency task force arrived in Russia’s southern Krasnodar region on Sunday as an oil spill in the Kerch Strait from two storm-stricken tankers continues to spread a month after it was first detected, officials said. The task force, which includes emergency situations minister Alexander Kurenkov, was set up after Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday called on authorities to ramp up the response to the spill, calling it “one of the most serious environmental challenges we have faced in recent years.”A local woman died on Sunday in the Ukraine-controlled part of Russia’s Kursk region after Russian strikes damaged a state boarding school where local people were sheltering, a Ukrainian official said. On Saturday evening, “Russian aviation carried out two air strikes on the area of the boarding school in Sudzha, as a result of which one woman suffered a laceration wound to her arm, and died in the morning,” Ukrainian army spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky said on television news.In Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, drone attacks injured eight people Sunday in the main city of Kherson and a nearby village, regional authorities said. In the Russian-controlled section of the Kherson region, a Ukrainian drone killed a 76-year-old woman, Russian-installed Governor Vladimir Saldo said on Telegram.

The Guardian,The squat secret: why this simple move is the key to long-term health – and how to improve yours,"Whether you want to lift weights in the gym or just get yourself on and off a chair, a good solid squat makes life so much easier. What can you do if yours needs work?Archimedes, they say, had a revelation in the bath, leaping from the tub to run starkers though the streets of Syracuse. Newton got an apple on the head. My Eureka moment came one morning as I tried to pick up some dog poo from a south London street. I was cold and stiff, and crouching down seemed the hardest thing in the world. Squatting had become a struggle, I realised, and I needed to do something about it.A good squat, after all, trains and tests everything from balance to coordination to mobility; your hips, your knees and your ankles; your quads, your glutes and your calves; your bones, your tendons and your muscles. If you can’t squat, you’re pretty much stuffed. Laura Kummerle, a Georgia-based physiotherapist and online coach, puts it more politely, but the gist’s the same. “The squat is a fundamental movement pattern,” she says. “It’s foundational for everything we do, from getting off a toilet to standing up from a chair.” And as far as keeping fit goes, “it gives you a good solid base for a lot of lower-body exercises”.

The trend is being fuelled by gen Z (those born between 1997 and 2012), many of whom have never worn a wristwatch before, typically using their smartphone to keep track of the time.

What fills the vacuum? Misinformation On 4 August 2024, the riots and disturbances that followed the killing of three children in Southport, on Merseyside, spread even further. That day, in the midst of a seething mess of far-right misinformation and rumour-mongering, the violence hit Rotherham – where people tried to set fire to a hotel housing asylum-seekers – as well as Middlesbrough and Bolton. Serving notice of his new interest in UK affairs, Elon Musk posted a picture of violence in Liverpool on X with a characteristically measured caption: “Civil war is inevitable.” And 24 hours later, the wave of unrest reached the city of Plymouth.It gripped the city centre throughout the evening of 5 August. To quote from the Guardian’s report, “150 officers in riot gear and with dogs sought to keep apart far-right rioters and Stand Up to Racism demonstrators”. Other people turned out to defend a mosque.

What’s not to like about liberalism, the idea that people are free to live their lives the way they want, so long as they’re not&nbsp;harming anyone else, and the state promotes equality of opportunity through a decent welfare state? It’s the politics of liberalism that paved the way for legislative reforms on race discrimination and gay marriage that have gone hand in hand with declining levels of social prejudice.I still regard these as important markers of progress. But today I feel sheepish about how simplistic my worldview used to be. Liberalism has much to offer, but there are risks&nbsp;in embracing it as an overarching political philosophy without a degree of humility about its shortcomings: its hollow silence over how to navigate knotty ethical issues where society needs some kind of shared understanding.

The Guardian,Being a parent means you’re never quite your own person again – but that self-sacrifice can pull off a miracle | Justin Toh,"Parents must frequently say no to their own wants and needs to help their child flourish – and grow into a wonderful adultRead more in our Making sense of it seriesI believe power trips and parenting should never mix, so I freaked out when the early childhood nurse told me that to my baby boy, I was a “goddess”. She meant he was dependent on me for everything, so I had to be everything to him, come what may. But the life divine didn’t come easily to me: my boy didn’t sleep much, so I didn’t either.A decade on, I’ve seen the light. The nurse was right all along: parenting is a God gig. You don’t need to be a believer for something miraculous to happen when you become a parent: you go about becoming the god you don’t believe in, and your child’s personal guarantee that the world is a welcoming place.

The Guardian,"Despite the promises, Labour may have to acknowledge more tax rises are needed | Heather Stewart","It would be politically painful, but so are other options if Rachel Reeves is to improve UK’s broken public servicesIt seems unlikely Rachel Reeves had “cut back public spending plans” on her list of new year resolutions – but by the end of a rocky week, it is clear she has the red pen ready, if bond markets fail to settle down.At one level, this makes perfect logical sense: the chancellor has promised not to raise taxes in the near future, after a whopping £40bn increase announced in October; and her fiscal rules are, as her chief secretary, Darren Jones, told MPs, “non-negotiable”.

The Guardian,The internet wants me to spend £500 on a jumper. How can I say no?,"I already have too much stuff – and every time I go online I’m being pushed to buy more. Time to channel my inner deinfluencerI am uneasily aware that around this time last year I wrote that my drive to acquire material things had somewhat subsided: I was older and wiser, had everything I needed, was repelled by the sheer volume of stuff in the world, blah blah blah. Unfortunately, the internet seemingly viewed that as fighting talk, an impossible-to-turn-down challenge, and in recent months I have once more found myself wanting stuff. Lots of stuff.It’s not surprising perhaps – stuff is everywhere, whispering, or shouting, to us from every screen we stare at. “The constant stream of ads on Instagram is exhausting,” said my best friend gloomily just last week, and she’s right: my eyes are constantly assaulted with offers of miracle goop for my mature skin, wellness gadgetry, expensive knitwear and greenwashed “disruptors” of almost everything. I just spent a minute scrolling and was offered, in quick succession, a “calfPRO” (no idea, alarming), kombucha, cleanser, an eco frying pan, “reminiscent of Phoebe Philo-era Celine” jumpers and, bafflingly, Canadian sea urchins.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"Britain is a weak link in Donald Trump’s new world order, so it needs to find friends… fast | Will Hutton","Amid deepening debt and an onslaught by the president-elect, Labour must  calm the markets, then think big economicallyIt’s certainly not 2008, nor even Truss 2022, but the men and women who move the financial markets are suddenly darkly pessimistic. Some of the private emails and WhatsApp messages circulating last week matched any efforts by Cassandra. The mood has turned against Britain.It is not one single thing, but a toxic mix. There is the prospect of a long period of stagflation, the consequence, as even the markets recognise, of 14 years of epic misgovernment. The problem now is partly that Labour does not have a plausible growth story, partly that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is painted as having an economic tin ear that douses capitalist animal spirits, and partly because Trump’s arrival has exposed just how dependent an indebted, economically wounded Britain is on the kindness of strangers. It’s not yet a crisis – the stock market has held up – but without some skilful economic and political statecraft, and a measure of luck, it may become one.

The Guardian,The right is trying to rewrite history with its toxic rhetoric on Britain’s rape gangs | Kenan Malik,"Girls who have suffered terrible abuse are now being exploited by populists for their own ends‘It has taken a man of Elon Musk’s influence to drag this into the light,” claims the Reform UK MP Rupert Lowe. The US tech entrepreneur’s discovery of Britain’s grooming gangs scandal, and his tirade of derogatory tweets directed at Keir Starmer, Jess Phillips and others, has turned Musk into a supercharged hero for certain sections of the right. And in this hero worship, his acolytes are rewriting history.Long before Musk started lobbing X-shaped bricks across the Atlantic, journalists and campaigners, often women on the left such as Julie Bindel, Anna Hall, Suzanne Moore and Samira Ahmed , had turned the spotlight on “grooming gangs” – better described as rape gangs and sex traffickers – and called out the failures of the authorities.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on capital punishment: an upsurge in executions should concern us all | Editorial,"The vast majority of countries have outlawed the death penalty. Yet the annual toll is growing – and Donald Trump wants to increase its useThe good news: Zimbabwe has just banned the death penalty. While it should remove an exemption clause, which might allow for capital punishment’s return were a state of emergency to be declared, the decision is another welcome step in the global journey towards abolition: 113 states have now banned executions.The bad news is that fewer countries have been killing more people in the last few years. Last May, Amnesty International recorded 1,153 executions in 2023, a 31% increase from the previous year and the highest level for almost a decade. (The figure is an underestimate since countries including China, believed to be the world’s largest executioner, do not publish data on the death penalty.) There was no letup in 2024. Iran reportedly executed more than 900&nbsp;people. Saudi Arabia is believed to have killed another 330, compared with 172 in 2023.

The Guardian,"The Guardian view on Argentina’s austerity year: painful cuts, rising poverty and a geopolitical gamble | Editorial","In his first 12 months Javier Milei has imposed drastic economic measures – sparking protests while banking on an IMF bailoutThe first foreign leader to meet Donald Trump after his victory last November was Argentina’s president, Javier&nbsp;Milei. The affinity is obvious: both are political outsiders united by extreme-right rhetoric and a penchant for anarchic capitalism. Mr Milei promised a war on bureaucrats, brutal public spending cuts and sweeping deregulation of Latin America’s second-largest economy. Predictably, the outcome has been devastating: a recession plunged more than half the country into poverty within the first six months of 2024.Mr Milei did not so much win the last election as the previous government lost it. When voters went to the polls in October 2023, monthly inflation stood at around 8%, fuelling frustration with the established parties and anxiety about the future – sentiments Mr&nbsp;Milei skilfully exploited. After his victory, monthly inflation soared to 25% before dropping back to under 3% in November. As a devotee of Milton Friedman, Mr&nbsp;Milei might claim his public sector cuts were painful but necessary. This is far from the truth. The reality, as the economist Matías Vernengo notes, is that Mr Milei devalued the peso, triggering a spike in domestic prices while using currency controls to keep a lid on further inflationary pressures.

We appeal to the education secretary to reconsider her decision to terminate funding for the Latin excellence programme (Letters, 31 December).We share the government’s desire to see equality of opportunity at the heart of educational provision, but believe that the Latin excellence programme has been successfully meeting exactly that challenge. Children at 40 non-selective state schools, the majority located in areas of economic deprivation, are now covered by the scheme, and more than a third of its by now over 5,000 pupils are eligible for free school meals – a remarkable uptake that indicates how exceptionally well the programme has been run.

There had been 35 goals in the last 10 meetings between these two great rivals and there were seven more in the final of the Spanish Super Cup. The only pity was that it happened in the wrong place. FC Barcelona had put four past Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu in October; now they went one better on their way to an extraordinary 5-2 victory, 5,000km away in Jeddah, a night when they played with two goalkeepers ending with a third, the injured captain Marc Andre ter Stegen, lifting the trophy.Barcelona had finished a man down and started a goal down, Wojciech Szczęsny beaten early and sent off later, but ultimately it didn’t matter. Hansi Flick’s side were just too good. Exceptional in fact, Raphinha tireless until he was withdrawn, cramp clawing at his calf, Lamine Yamal for ever sending opponents the wrong way and Pedri gliding across another stage. For an hour they dominated and then, for half an hour, once Szczęsny had been shown a red card, they controlled with a coolness that made light of how long was left and the history and talent of the team before them.

The Guardian,The food filter: who makes the best crunchy peanut butter?,"From Whole Earth and Meridian to supermarket staples, which is the best crunchy peanut butter, and how much do you really need to spend on it?The best tinned tomatoesI came late to the peanut butter party, and my mum remains convinced that it’s extremely unhealthy stuff, which, to be fair to her, is probably true of the sugary versions of my childhood. In the past few years, however, peanut butter has gone back to its health-food roots. It is now championed for its protein and monounsaturated fat content, as brands stripped of their sweeteners and emulsifiers have occupied the premium end of the market. Given that these new-wave natural peanut butters tend to contain nothing but peanuts – give or take the odd pinch of salt – the difference between supermarket own-label and luxury jars tends to be slight. The biggest variations are largely in the sourcing and quality of the peanuts themselves.This means that peanut butter is a handy thing to have in the cupboard at all times. Personally, I prefer a loose, crunchy consistency; for all the claims about sustainable palm oil, there’s simply no need for it in peanut butter, which, like tahini, separates naturally over time and is just as easily stirred back together. To slow the separation, simply beat the oil back in, then store the jar upside down in the fridge – assuming it lasts that long. Continue reading...","Sat, 11 Jan 2025 10:00:10 GMT",0.6369,0.7966

Its funky, driving beat, powerful horns and vocal interplay between Moore’s high tenor voice and Prater’s gritty baritone made it a soul and gospel classic.Its writers, Isaac Hayes and David Porter, had drawn inspiration from the US civil rights movement, seeing the song as “a story about one man’s struggle to rise above his present conditions”.

The Guardian,The Shetland Way by Marianne Brown review – a daughter’s journey to the heart of the climate crisis,"An environmental writer returns to her father’s home for his funeral in a family memoir that becomes an examination of Shetland’s crucial role in the energy landscapeAs with many nature-centric memoirs of recent years, Marianne Brown’s debut, The Shetland Way, begins with personal loss. It opens at the funeral of her father, Bill, on his home island of Shetland, a place she knows only in glimpses; her parents separated when she was two, and her relationship with her father was characterised by absence, “always promising something it would never deliver”. But her connection with the islands and her late father is forced into an accelerated intimacy; the funeral takes place in February 2020 as the pandemic spreads, and Brown finds herself unexpectedly spending the months of lockdown with her partner and young daughter in Shetland: “Confinement in a land that claimed half my genealogy, a history and culture of which I knew next to nothing about.”They stay in the house that Bill, a potter, had built alongside the ruins of his grandparents’ croft, an immediate and constant reminder of the complex layers of history written into the islands’ very landscape. In the 1970s, oil wealth changed the fortunes of Shetland, but it’s impossible to forget that Brown’s own family, like most of their neighbours, are only a few generations away from the precarious life of crofters, at the mercy of unpredictable weather, crop blight and unscrupulous lairds, a relatively recent history of emigration and starvation. There is an awareness among the islanders that, despite the presence of Sullom Voe, one of Europe’s largest oil terminals, the “black gold” is a finite resource; the more forward-thinking have accordingly turned their attention to the one thing Shetland is unlikely to run out of: wind.

While many of the debates that built up to the revolution centered around taxes, a little-known legal controversy from the era suggests that the crown and colonists also differed when it came to LGBTQ+ rights.Serving with the 18th Regiment of Foot in Philadelphia, the British army chaplain Robert Newburgh was accused of having had sexual relations with a man – or as it was known at the time, buggery. Viewing his standing within the regiment as undermined, Newburgh sought recourse in a variety of court cases culminating with a court martial in 1774 – the year before the revolution.

How your listening habits affect your love life,"Psychologists say that singing, dancing and song preferences play a key role in the viability of romantic relationships“What’s the one thing your readers should do to help them use music to find and catch the partner of their dreams?” asks Patrick Savage, a senior research fellow in psychology at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. “Go to karaoke and sing a duet. Go and sing A Whole New World with Brad Kane and Lea Salonga. That’s the number one recommendation by science. Well, just by me. I don’t have data on this, but from my personal experience, that’s the best.”Given that he is a musicologist, it is perhaps unsurprising that music is a key part of Savage’s relationship with his wife. But his experience with using music as a romantic tool is not unique. Love songs are found across cultures and despite not being a neat category they have historically been most popular – 67% of the top 40 tracks in America between 1960 and 2010 contained love themes.

The Guardian,How to optimise the cognitive benefits of dreams and sleep,"Dreaming is vital to our mental health – and it is possible to use them for our own goodDreams are pure emotional and cognitive gold. Those often surreal, fragmented images and plot lines that can instantly evaporate when we open our eyes, allow us not only to explore the themes and challenges of our day, but to step into the what-ifs of tomorrow.Whether we remember our dreams or not, our brain and dreams are multi-tasking to the nth degree while we sleep. Together, they are shunting keeper memories into our memory bank, ditching others that don’t make the grade and strengthening positive emotions. They are weakening negative or traumatic ones, bolstering our stress resilience, cognitive function, problem-solving capabilities and our mental health. All of which explains the emotional rollercoaster that can come with sleep deprivation and insomnia (I’ve been there). Because when we’re sleep-deprived, we’re dream-deprived, robbed of those invaluable sleep-dependent perks that give us a depth of insight and emotional processing that’s out of reach to our waking selves.

We briefly dated four years ago, but he ended things via text, which has left me feeling anxious about the possibility of him leaving again. This relationship is important to us and we’ve moved in together while trying to start a family. However, since moving in, I’ve noticed changes in him. He sometimes seems distant and our sex life has diminished. He has struggled with maintaining an erection and attributed it to a “lack of attraction”, which was difficult for me to hear.Given the stress of fertility treatments, I suspect his issues may be emotional or physical, yet he focuses on attraction. He has suggested we reconnect through non-sexual intimacy like holding hands, which I’m willing to try. I also proposed couples therapy, which he’s hesitant about. I feel uneasy, especially when I see him looking at women online. I worry the fertility struggles are causing tension, and I fear he might leave if we can’t conceive. Although I want to work on this, part of me feels like running away. I’d appreciate any insights or advice on how to navigate these feelings and strengthen our relationship.

The Guardian,"The 10 rules of friendship: show up, go beyond banter, learn the boring details","Writers, therapists and academics give advice on how to make, and strengthen, meaningful bonds with mates and friendsEmma Reed Turrell, psychotherapist, author and host of the podcast Friendship TherapyYou can keep balance in friendship by showing your working out, rather than making assumptions and mind-reading. This might sound like: “I’d like to invite you to a party but I’m wondering if it might not be your thing and I want you to know that you can absolutely say no, or just come for an hour.” That way you get to express your wish and your friend gets to be honest in their choices, rather than people-please you or dodge the question. Look for the ‘both/and’ of a balanced friendship, rather than an ‘either/or’ situation, and negotiate how to both get what you need from your communication styles or time together, rather than create a one-way street in which one of you is always keeping the other happy. Not everyone wants a two-way street in friendship and you might find you get push-back if you seek to rebalance an existing relationship but a true friend will welcome your honesty and one that doesn’t might not have been a friend at all.

The Guardian,The big picture: Henry Roy’s sleeping girl in Congo-Brazzaville,"The Franco-Haitian artist’s 2002 portrait exemplifies his gift for taking photographs that transcend time and placeHenry Roy’s book, Impossible Island, a survey of 40 years of his photography, is threaded with images of sleepers and dreamers in different corners of the world – Thailand, Tunisia, his adoptive France, his native Haiti. Roy took this picture of a girl making an impromptu cradle of a wheelbarrow in Congo-Brazzaville in 2002. Like all of his most evocative photographs, it asks several questions of the viewer – but the overriding one seems to be: how sleepy do you have to be to take a nap here?Roy’s photos often work this way: they create little mythologies that seem to take their subjects outside their particular time and place. As he noted of his practice in his 2017 book Superstition, what he is always restless for are images that “murmur the secret language of a world free from what contaminates us”. Here, the vibrant Sunday-best floral prints of the girl, the precision of her hair, seem to elevate her above the clay and dust of her surroundings. It comes as no surprise, looking at Roy’s pictures, that they have been cited as primary inspirations by cinematographers and film-makers, notably Oscar-winning director Barry Jenkins, who has suggested that he was inspired to create some of the visual sensuality of Moonlight by looking at Roy’s work.Impossible Island is published by Loose Joints Continue reading...","Sun, 12 Jan 2025 07:00:26 GMT",0.0,0.9719
The Guardian,Couldn’t put it down: David Hurn’s photographs of people reading – in pictures,"In 1983 David Hurn met one of his photographic heroes, André Kertész , and jokingly suggested that, when he reached Kertész’s age of 89, he would remake his seminal volume, On Reading. True to his word, the Magnum photographer has now done so. Wherever Hurn travelled as a photojournalist, he took images of people reading books, magazines and, lately, on mobile phones. “One of the things that happens in every country in the world is people read,” he says. “It’s lovely to read – the touch of the paper, the ease of being able to check back a few pages. But we’re at a time now where we’re not quite sure whether, in the future, books on paper are going to disappear.”David Hurn’s On Reading is published by RRB Photobooks (£35) Continue reading...","Sat, 11 Jan 2025 17:00:09 GMT",0.0,0.6336

It’s not uncommon for people here to step away from the office grind for a while and find solace in lunchtime sports.
