The Guardian,‘Their bodies had turned to black’: Syrian chlorine victims can finally speak out,"A chemical attack on the town of Douma killed 43 people in 2018. Now Assad has fallen, the enforced silence of those who witnessed it is overFor years, residents of Ghouta, an embattled opposition-held region on the outskirts of Damascus, grew used to death loudly announcing its presence. When Syrian and Russian jets or helicopter gunships roared overhead, bombs were never far behind. But the night of 7 April 2018 was different.According to an extensive investigation by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), two yellow cylinders were dropped from a Syrian air force helicopter, crashing through the top floor of one apartment building and landing on a balcony of another, in the eastern Ghouta town of Douma. The noise they made was negligible compared with the explosions of barrel bombs and airstrikes. But the concentrated green-yellow chlorine gas that hissed out of the canisters was no less deadly.

The Guardian,"Ukraine war briefing: North Korean troops join Russian assaults in ‘significant’ numbers, Kyiv says","North Koreans joining assaults on Kursk front, says Zelenskyy, urging fresh allied response; Ukrainian drones hit oil facility in Russia’s Oryol region. What we know on day 1,026Russia has begun using North Korean troops in significant numbers for the first time to conduct assaults on Ukrainian forces battling to hold territory in Russia’s Kursk region, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Saturday. “Today, we already have preliminary data that the Russians have begun to use North Korean soldiers in their assaults. A significant number of them,” Zelenskyy told Ukrainians in his daily wartime address. The North Koreans were being used in combined Russian units and only on the Kursk front for now, he said, adding: “We have information suggesting their use could extend to other parts of the frontline.” North Korean soldiers had so far not entered the fight on Ukrainian soil, but were already taking “noticeable” losses.The Ukrainian president said the more active use of the troops was a new escalation and called for a global response, as Donald Trump’s return to the White House next month fuels speculation of a push for peace talks. Zelenskyy issued the fresh appeal to Ukraine’s western allies to strengthen their support for Kyiv, saying that he would discuss it with European partners next week. Russia has neither confirmed nor denied the presence of North Koreans on its side.Ukraine’s general staff reported a significant increase in the number of Russian assaults on the Kursk front, along with airstrikes, glide bomb raids and more than 200 artillery attacks. Andrii Kovalenko, an official at Ukraine’s national security and defence council, said the North Koreans had taken losses, but he provided no numbers. “The Russians are counting on numbers and are trying to carry out assault operations with the help of the Koreans, when the task of the Koreans is to run under the blows of our forces and occupy certain areas,” Kovalenko wrote on Telegram. Ukraine launched an incursion into Russia’s western Kursk region in August and has battled to hold the area.Ukrainian drones carried out an overnight attack on an oil facility in Russia’s Oryol region that is a crucial source of fuel supplies for Russian troops, Ukraine’s military said on Saturday. Russian authorities said their firefighters were battling a blaze in the western Oryol region caused by a drone attack. Earlier, Russian regional governor Andrei Klychko said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukrainian drones had struck a fuel infrastructure facility, causing a fire but no casualties. He said 11 drones had been shot down over the region. The Oryol region neighbours Russia’s Kursk region. The Ukrainian strikes came a day after Russia fired 93 cruise and ballistic missiles and almost 200 drones at its neighbour, further battering Ukraine’s energy infrastructure.A former FBI informant accused of falsely claiming that Joe Biden and the president’s son Hunter had accepted Ukrainian bribes has agreed to plead guilty to federal charges, according to court papers. As part of the plea deal, Alexander Smirnov will admit he fabricated the story that became central to a Republican impeachment inquiry in Congress. He was accused of falsely reporting to the FBI in June 2020 that executives associated with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma paid Hunter Biden and Joe Biden $5m each in 2015 or 2016.Ukraine’s air defences shot down 58 of 132 Russian drones launched in an overnight attack, the Ukrainian air force said on Saturday. It said 72 Russian drones were “lost” due to the use of electronic warfare. There were no immediate reports of major damage. Russia’s military said on Saturday that it had downed 60 drones overnight.In Russia’s Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, a drone attack killed a nine-year-old boy and wounded his mother and baby sister, said the governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov. He posted photos of the family’s home with a hole in the facade and the roof partially torn off. The mother and seven-month-old sister were hospitalised with injuries, Gladkov said.

The Guardian,Wham! Last Christmas Unwrapped review – special TV to give your heart to,"This winter warmer is so much more than just a deep dive into one of the greatest festive tunes – it’s an astonishing tribute to the genius of George MichaelWhat a big-hearted winter warmer Wham: Last Christmas Unwrapped turns out to be. This hour-long special promises an in-depth look at one of the most successful Christmas songs of all time, though curiously, it wasn’t until 39 years after its initial release, in 1984, that it finally became Britain’s festive number one. Much like the podcast Song Exploder, this documentary pulls the song and the video apart, discussing how they were written and made, before analysing their cultural impact. All fascinating, particularly to fans, but even fans might be surprised at how intimate and lovely the conversations about George Michael are here.You can tell this is going to be joyful from the off. While Last Christmas is the angel on top of the tree, this acts as a potted history of Wham! too, beginning in 1984, the year everything went right for them. Michael tells his side of the story, his contributions taken from old archive interviews, while Andrew Ridgeley, Shirlie Kemp and Pepsie Demacque-Crockett talk through everything from meeting as kids, to filming that famous snowy video, to the devastation caused by the death of the man they all call Yog at Christmas, at the age of 53.

Two further weird goals later – the sort of accidents that speak of a profound carelessness – and it was clear that the banter era still has some time to run.That was only the beginning.

Already severely depleted by injury, the Sharks’ options were further limited by Plumtree’s decision to leave stellar names such as Siya Kolisi, Andre Esterhuizen and Ox Nché back home in South Africa. The only possible conclusion was that this match had long since been written off as a cross in the “L” column by the visitors.The Sharks had listed 15 players as unavailable due to injury when naming a XV featuring eight changes from last week’s home victory against Exeter. Bongi Mbonambi, Eben Etzebeth, Lukhanyo Am and Makazole Mapimpi were among those sidelined. But the absence of Kolisi, Esterhuizen and Nché – fit but rested – must have been a bitter disappointment for anyone who bought a ticket.

The Guardian,Sad but true – Donald Trump really did wrestle his way into the White House | David Moon,"The president-elect’s victory was straight out of the pro wrestling playbook. Voters knew it was fake, but they loved itDo you remember World Wrestling Entertainment? For many people, the show, in which muscle-bound wrestlers in tight tights throw one another around in staged fights, is a nostalgic throwback to the early 2000s, when it played briefly on Channel 4. Today, its mix of soap opera, theatre and athletic spectacle still draws millions of viewers each week. To some, it’s a guilty pleasure; to others, timeless entertainment. Still, few would associate it with the serious world of politics.For Donald Trump, though, professional wrestling is a lifelong passion. His announcement in November that the former CEO of WWE, Linda McMahon, would take up the role of education secretary in his cabinet of curiosities elicited shock and disbelief. It is impossible to fully understand US politics today without understanding the significance of pro wrestling. Continue reading...","Sat, 14 Dec 2024 07:00:11 GMT",0.3919,0.9467

All three framed the bombings as an attempt to protect their interests after a lightning offensive by rebel fighters triggered Assad’s sudden ouster – and the withdrawal of his two main foreign protectors, Russia and Iran.In the heady hours after Assad fled to Moscow, thousands of political prisoners were freed from the Baathist regime’s prisons and torture centers. Syrians tore down statues and photos of Assad and his father, Hafez, who took power in 1970 and turned Syria into a police state. All told, father and son had ruled Syria for 54 years. But millions of Syrians barely had time to absorb the fact that the Assad family’s reign had finally ended before it became clear that other outside actors would be jockeying to shape Syria’s future.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York University Continue reading...","Sat, 14 Dec 2024 11:00:14 GMT",0.34,-0.2846

On Sunday the World Darts Championship returns to Alexandra Palace in north London, and in its wake throngs of young people dressed as gnomes and traffic cones drinking beer and breaking into song. And at the very centre of this culture stands a kebab-loving hero for our times – Luke “the Nuke” Littler.Littler has had an extraordinary year.

The Guardian,"The Guardian view on AI’s power, limits, and risks: it may require rethinking the technology","OpenAI’s new ‘o1’ system seeks to solve the limits to growth but it raises concerns about control and the risks of smart machinesMore than 300 million people use OpenAI’s ChatGPT each week, a testament to the technology’s appeal. This month, the company unveiled a “pro mode” for its new “o1” AI system, offering human-level reasoning — for 10 times the current $20 monthly subscription fee. One of its advanced behaviours appears to be self-preservation. In testing, when the system was led to believe it would be shut down, it attempted to disable an oversight mechanism. When “o1” found memos about its replacement, it tried copying itself and overwriting its core code. Creepy? Absolutely.More realistically, the move probably reflects the system’s programming to optimise outcomes rather than demonstrating intentions or awareness. The idea of creating intelligent machines induces feelings of unease. In computing this is the gorilla problem: 7m years ago, a now-extinct primate evolved, with one branch leading to gorillas and one to humans. The concern is that just as gorillas lost control over their fate to humans, humans might lose control to superintelligent AI. It is not obvious that we can control machines that are smarter than us.

The Guardian,What Labour can do to defeat the fantasy politics of populism | Letters,"John Chowcat says voters need a personal stake in democracy, while Stephen Coleman looks at why people turn to the magical thinking of demagogues. Plus letters from Anthony Papadopoulos, Colleen Molloy and Rodney BarkerJonathan Freedland’s stark warning is justified (We cannot afford for Starmer’s government to fail. Because Farage is lying in wait, 6 December). A resurgent narrow nationalism, blaming immigrants for the UK’s squeezed living standards and underfunded public services, could replace Labour in office if Starmer’s growth strategy falters over the next few years. Donald Trump’s protectionism and corporate tax cuts could shortly attract yet more overseas investment to an already strong US economy, further weakening economic recovery here.Labour does need to demonstrate practical improvements that voters will recognise. A closely related deep problem also requires attention. A period of economic pessimism and disillusionment with conventional British politics makes many people feel powerless, unable to control their destinies – a sentiment often manipulated by hard-right nativists promoting social division. To counter this, voters need a personal stake in democracy, through genuine experience of collective debate and&nbsp;real public accountability.

The Guardian,Sir David Jason: ‘You’ve got to make your audience enjoy it’,"The actor, 84, talks about memories of the Blitz, surviving through humour, the inspiration of Ronnie Barker and being knighted by the QueenNear the end of the Second World War, I must have been about four, and we were in a canvas shelter in my house with my mother and father. The bombs were dropping and I was getting frightened and my mother cuddled me and said: “It’s all right, don’t worry, it’s only God moving his furniture around”, and that put me at ease I’ve never forgotten that, and every time there’s a thunderstorm I always remember it and it just calms me down.As a young boy, humour was survival. I would have been about eight or nine when I met with a load of lads in a pretty tough area, and being very small and slight I had to work out how to not get beaten up. So I quickly observed that if you make somebody laugh, they’ll be more likely to become your friend than your enemy. Continue reading...","Sat, 14 Dec 2024 14:00:17 GMT",0.4939,0.9612
The Guardian,‘It’s game over for facts’: how vibes came to rule everything from pop to politics,"From voters picking up ‘bad vibes’ to the Brat girl summer, vague instincts now make the world go round. Does this represent a crisis of seriousness or has it always been feelings that make us human? Facts were cool for about 250 years. From the Enlightenment until this century, facts were where it was at. They had a good innings. But it is game over for facts, the end of the line for statistics. These days, what counts is what you feel. In other words, it’s all about the vibe.Vibes are everywhere. Disillusioned Labour voters are “picking up bad vibes”, reports this paper. The Bank of England gets “wrong-footed by a vibe shift in the economy”. In the US, a “vibe-cession” – a downturn in economic confidence at an impressionistic level – was a key electoral issue. Google Maps will not only give you directions, but “vibe check” a neighbourhood for you. Of all this year’s hit albums, the one that had a vibe named after it – Brat – won the culture, catapulting Charli XCX to seven Grammy nominations. When a new production of Romeo &amp; Juliet opened on Broadway recently, a US newspaper wrote that “the vibe is very ‘teens hanging out in the Target parking lot’, only with a lot more sonnets and glitter” – because even William Shakespeare is no one without a vibe these days.

The Guardian,Nightbitch review – Amy Adams carries frustrating mum-on-the-edge comedy drama,"Adams plays a struggling mother who starts to turn into a dog in Marielle Heller’s uneven adaptation of Rachel Yoder’s bestsellerMotherhood, according to Amy Adams’s frazzled, unnamed mum to a toddler in Marielle Heller’s Nightbitch, “is perhaps the most violent experience a human can have aside from death itself”. It’s feral, primal and animalistic, an experience that strips away our fastidious qualms and sees us nose-deep in nappies and newly expert in a whole realm of physical indignities. Motherhood, to put it simply, is a beast of a thing – literally, in the case of this odd blend of banal reality and fantasy.This Amy Adams-starring adaptation of the 2021 novel by Rachel Yoder attempts, not always successfully, to strike a balance between the book’s intellectual curiosity and genre cinema’s inclination to veer towards shock tactics and body horror. There are parallels with films such as Tully and The Babadook in the blurred realities and sense of being gaslit by your own urges and needs, but having identified its allegory for motherhood – Adams’s character finds herself turning into a dog – the picture doesn’t know what to do with it. Nightbitch repeats the same points over and over, like a sleep-deprived new mum attempting to wrestle with a shopping list. Parts of the film work well, the dance of avoidance around marital tensions and festering grievances playing out in Adams’s expressive face. Yet this is hardly revelatory stuff.In UK and Irish cinemas Continue reading...","Sat, 14 Dec 2024 15:00:19 GMT",-0.1027,-0.8984
The Guardian,Aaron Pierre: ‘There wasn’t one day filming Rebel Ridge that I didn’t have a bruise or a cut’,"His intense turn in Netflix’s smash hit thriller made the Croydon-born actor go global. Next up he’s playing Mufasa in the Lion King prequel. Bring on the big roles, he saysImagine a young James Earl Jones, Darth Vader himself, if he was from south London. That’s how smooth and chill Aaron Pierre, 30-year-old actor and star of Netflix hit Rebel Ridge, sounds when he fixes you with his sea-green eyes and tells you how his day’s been going: “I’m still working myself out, you know? Still learning, still growing …” That voice, in combination with those eyes, commands an audience’s attention, even in relatively small roles. Such as when he played Cassio in a 2018 production of Othello at south London’s Globe; or a man escaping slavery alongside Thuso Mbedu in Prime Video’s 2021 Golden Globe-winning series The Underground Railroad.The voice-eyes combo also marks Pierre out as a natural heir to Earl Jones, the veteran actor whose seven-decade career included the original Star Wars movies, as well as voicing Simba’s stern-but-loving father Mufasa in the animated Lion King movie back in 1994. It’s a role that Pierre will step into when the latest instalment in the franchise, a prequel to the photorealistic 2019 remake of the Disney classic, comes&nbsp;out later this month.

I looked exceptional, glorious, fabulous – the most beautiful girl in the world. I had discovered a brand of fake tan that worked well on my skin, and my body was toned from all the yoga. There was a lot of money sloshing around in comedy, so I could afford to do lots of different setups for my Edinburgh festival poster.

That was the score Mary Louis was given by an AI-powered tenant screening tool. The software, SafeRent, didn’t explain in its 11-page report how the score was calculated or how it weighed various factors. It didn’t say what the score actually signified. It just displayed Louis’s number and determined it was too low. In a box next to the result, the report read: “Score recommendation: DECLINE”.Louis, who works as a security guard, had applied for an apartment in an eastern Massachusetts suburb. At the time she toured the unit, the management company said she shouldn’t have a problem having her application accepted. Though she had a low credit score and some credit card debt, she had a stellar reference from her landlord of 17 years, who said she consistently paid her rent on time.

Even from her beginnings as a new artist in the movement that signified radical Black American consciousness, Giovanni always seemed aware of her singular power.

The Guardian,Gotta lotta bottle: doing the rounds with Britain’s last milkmen – photo essay,"Their floats were once a regular sight, quietly whirring down the country’s streets, delivering daily pints. Photographer Maxine Beuret captures the vanishing world of electric milk floats (and their drivers)You often hear them before you see them: the unmistakable clink and tinkle of glass bottles in crates, and the low whine of the electric motor. Milk floats are a uniquely British sight, and an increasingly rare one, which is why the British photographer and cultural historian Maxine Beuret has spent 20 years documenting their use by dairies across England, as part of her project Two Pints Please.Beuret, who calls herself a historian of the commonplace, has documented several quirks of British culture that are at risk of disappearing (or have since gone), including slam-door commuter trains, TfL’s Routemaster buses before they were decommissioned, and traditional shops in the Midlands including a sweet shop, a men’s outfitters and a hardware store. She first photographed an electric milk float while undertaking another project called Familiar Interiors of Leicester – her hometown – in 2005. As well as creating a record of the library, the hospital, the pub and other cherished places, she visited the local dairy, Kirby &amp; West, and “instantly fell in love” with the milk floats, she says. “I&nbsp;loved the compact, functional design, clean lines, and fragile sense of history they carried with them.”Overlooking the yard at Parker Dairies Continue reading...","Sat, 14 Dec 2024 08:00:10 GMT",0.0,0.765
