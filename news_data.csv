One of the most glamorous names in fashion is up for grabs, with Prada, its longtime rival for Milan bragging rights, thought to be close to purchasing the company. The prospect of a sale raises the question of whether Donatella, designer since the death of her brother in 1997, will remain as creative lead.Versace without Donatella is hard to imagine. She remains a hands-on designer, and the lightning rod through which Versace’s energy is conducted. “Everyone should have a little Versace attitude,” she said before this show, held under the iron shelter of a historic tram depot in Milan where, as a concession to guest’s skimpy outfits, the benches were heated.

Here bartenders share tips on how to order your first, why a small tweak can radically change it, and a recipe for your freezerGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailThe martini is a huge drink in a tiny glass – and not simply because it packs two standards into about 70ml.

In recent years the drink has returned to the top of cocktail menus, driven by bartenders’ experimentations and appreciation of its versatility.When the martini-dedicated Bar Planet opened in Sydney’s Newtown nearly three years ago, Jeremy Blackmore, the creative director of Mucho Group, the company behind the venue, says the cocktail’s image was: “Still a bit stodgy … a grandma’s drink.

The Guardian,Timothée Chalamet deserves an Oscar – for his Oscar campaign,"A Complete Unknown’s best actor nominee might lose out on the prize to The Brutalist favorite Adrien Brody but his journey to the stage has been award-worthyOn Sunday, Timothée Chalamet could become, at 29 years, two months and three days, the youngest best actor winner in Oscar history. But whether or not his performance as Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown beats out presumed frontrunner Adrien Brody – the current youngest best actor, at 29 years, 11 months and nine days in 2003 – Chalamet has already won arguably the most important prize of modern movie stardom: the hearts and minds of the internet.If we’re in the business of giving out awards for deserving, boundary-pushing work, then Chalamet’s best actor campaign – unofficial and often unspoken efforts to sway awards voters and build public sentiment – deserves its own Oscar. For the past several months, ostensibly in support of A Complete Unknown but seemingly just as much for laughs, Chalamet has embarked on a rare press run of consistent wins that generated viral moments and appealed to the reference-averse, absurdist sensibilities of his generation, bucking the usually staid methods of Hollywood promotion. Whereas past best actor hopefuls have erred on the side of grateful, serious and dutiful to the self-importance of the boomer-skewing Academy, Chalamet has worn kitschy outfits to red carpet events, treated social media like an ironic art experiment and made the rounds with influencers. In other words, though Chalamet is technically a millennial (born in 1995), we are witnessing the first genZ Oscar campaign. Continue reading...","Fri, 28 Feb 2025 14:45:29 GMT",0.0,0.9979

This group also had the lowest proportion of people who thought their partner was “definitely” in love with them – just 25.31% – and the lowest proportion having sex, at 82.72%.Moderate: About four in 10 – 40.91% – landed in this category, which Bode described as “fairly stock-standard” – or in the words of the journal article, “entirely unremarkable”. Those in this category were more likely to be male, and less likely to have children. This group had “relatively low intensity, relatively low obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and relatively moderate frequency of sex”.Intense: This category described about one in three – 29.42% – of survey respondents, who Bode described as “crazy in-love” types. They were characterised by “the highest intensity, highest obsessive thinking, highest commitment, and relatively high frequency of sex”. About six in 10 people in this group were female.Libidinous: About one in 10 – 9.64% – were libidinous romantic lovers, who had sex an average of 10 times a week and up to 20 times.

The Guardian,A humiliation at the White House and what does it tell us? Trump would make a colony of my country | Andrey Kurkov,"A cold reality hit us in Washington. Zelenskyy was being forced to buy hope of  survival by people who have no care for our freedomIt’s warming up in Kyiv. The temperature has risen from -5C to 4C. Sometimes, the sun peeps through breaks in the clouds, but Kyivites are not much cheered by the sunshine. They are not watching for signs of spring as they usually do at this time of year. The atmosphere in the city and in the country as a whole has been one of nervous expectation. This was not an expectation of an end to military action or the signing of a peace treaty with Russia – nothing so specific. Indeed, it was not at all clear what we were waiting for, but it was something connected with Donald Trump and the change in US policy towards Ukraine.Clarity emerged at today’s macabre theatre at the White House: handshakes, a thumbs up and some fist pumps from the US president, before Trump sat side by side with Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss a minerals-for-war-support deal and to humiliate him. At the same time, air raid sirens were sounding in northern and eastern Ukraine. Soon the talks were off and Zelenskyy was gone.Andrey Kurkov is a Ukrainian novelist and the author of Death and the PenguinDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"Black models, foreign films, queer culture – how the Face shaped me as a young man | Marc Thompson","In the 1980s and 90s this pioneering magazine was a hub for subcultures, but in today’s digital landscape trends are followed rather than setI still remember the first copy of the Face magazine I bought at age 14. It was the January 1984 issue, with model and pop-rock singer Nick Kamen on the cover, in a ski cap. As a young kid, I bought magazines weekly, starting with Look-in, a preteen music and television magazine, followed by the brightly coloured teen bible Smash Hits and then the Face, the last two founded by Nick Logan. The Face was like a cool, older teenager who invited you into a sexy new world where fashion, music and design fused to create a revolutionary culture. As a young Black gay man, that invitation meant everything.This truly was the heyday of magazines, as I was reminded when visiting The Face Magazine: Culture Shift at the National Portrait Gallery last week. I was moved to see all of the magazine covers and spreads that I had collected and hung up on the walls in my youth. There was a particular image of the Kiss FM crew in their studio with Norman Jay, Gordon Mac and Paul “Trouble” Anderson, DJs whom I had loved and followed. When I was 16 and had left school, the Face opened a window into London’s arts, music, clubbing, queer and fashion scene, which took me out of my small world in south London and allowed me to aspire to something different. Beyond the capital’s walls, the magazine introduced me to the emerging house music scene in Chicago and New York, and foreign-language films.

Decades ago he went off to New Mexico, away from the bright lights of fame. And the dog went with him and his wife. Hackman was a firm man – you might say hard. He had been a marine, and seldom bowed to all the suck-up stuff about being lovable and a movie star. He was 95. Clint Eastwood is 94, Robert Duvall the same. Jack Nicholson is only 87, still the kid.Dustin Hoffman is 87 too, Robert Redford 88, Warren Beatty 87. Harrison Ford is 82, and he seems older, or worried.

The Guardian,"The BBC wanted black listeners and turned to Tim Westwood, white son of a vicar. A parable for our times | Jane Martinson","Of the many lessons arising from this week’s report into the presenter’s alleged bullying and misogyny, one is the corporate cynicism that sustained himMore than 30 years have passed since Tim Westwood joined the BBC, 12 since he left and three since Guardian and BBC journalists reported on allegations of abuse by a man considered by the corporation to be the voice of hip hop. Then this week, some of the many concerns raised during his 19 years working there were detailed in the latest edition of one of the BBC’s weightiest and longest-running series, Official Reports into Men We Employ Behaving Very Badly.Westwood’s career at the Beeb ended in 2013, amid a flurry of accusations and a sense of deja vu best summarised as “oh God, not another one”. But the 174-page report is well worth reading, not just for what it says about the BBC but, as so often with the media, what it says about attitudes in Britain.Jane Martinson is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"Well done for surviving the Trump test, PM. But our true friends are in Europe | Stella Creasy","Keir Starmer seems to have secured a diplomatic coup, however let’s be clear – the president’s view of us remains hostileIf a week is a long time in politics, a week dominated by the fascination and fear as to what President Trump may do next is an eternity. Fresh off the plane from Washington, Keir Starmer will spend this weekend hosting the great and good of our continent as they take stock of prospects for Ukraine. For the third time since the second world war – after Suez in 1956 and Iraq in 2003 – the United Kingdom is being forced to work out where it stands between the US and Europe.In the aftermath of those past crises, Britain chose to hug the US as tightly as possible, even if that meant drifting away from European friends. The prime minister appears to have secured a diplomatic coup in getting through his crunch encounter with Donald Trump mostly unscathed. But don’t let bonhomie and bad taste comments about wives fool you: we are still in crisis, and the old routine won’t save us. Continue reading...","Fri, 28 Feb 2025 12:06:20 GMT",0.875,0.5574

The Guardian,The Guardian view on PM’s gamble: exploiting crisis to remake Labour was a step too far for an ally | Editorial,"The exit of a soft-left intellectual politician from government highlights a growing unease about the reordering of the party’s prioritiesThe resignation of Anneliese Dodds, the international development minister, from Labour’s cabinet may not have been entirely unexpected. Sir Keir Starmer’s decision to cut the aid budget to “pay” for increased defence spending was wrong. Making the world’s poorest foot the bill for Britain’s security is reckless and&nbsp;self-defeating. Slashing aid fuels instability – it won’t&nbsp;buy&nbsp;safety. From her perch in government Ms Dodds, who was Sir Keir’s first shadow chancellor, knew&nbsp;this better than most.The former cabinet minister’s letter is right to warn that the cuts will mean the UK withdrawing from many developing countries and having a diminished role in global institutions like the World Bank, the G7 and climate negotiations. She pointedly argued Britain will find it “impossible” to deliver on its commitment to maintain development spending in Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine with the shrunken budget. Sir Keir rebuffed this charge, but Ms Dodds is right to say his move is being seen as following the Trumpian lead in cutting USAid – a framing that implies the UK is losing its independent foreign policy direction.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

After the combined persuasion and flattery of Sir Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron brought out a somewhat tamer and more jovial version of the US president, there were modest hopes that the Ukrainian president’s visit to Washington might be more productive than feared – even if there was no sign that they had succeeded in tempting Mr Trump towards the security assurances so desperately needed.Instead, his Oval Office meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy soon exploded into acrimony, with the US president berating his guest for ingratitude. Mr Trump had earlier spoken of partnership with the Ukrainian president. But he and his vice-president, JD Vance, teamed up to deliver a public kicking.

Their goals are modest but of the kind that nourish an entire sport: to provide a safe and welcoming environment in which the community’s youngsters can play. There are hurdles to overcome, such as a need for up-to-date artificial pitches and the challenge of increasing participation among girls.On Saturday afternoon, though, Skoppum and Norway’s 1,700 grassroots clubs will be asked to make a decision that could cause shockwaves far beyond their country. They will gather online or at Oslo’s Ullevaal Stadion for the Norwegian Football Federation’s (NFF) annual general assembly and are entitled to vote on whether video assistant referees are scrapped in the highest division, Eliteserien. It will conclude a saga that has ripped at the domestic game’s fabric.

It’s also up for song of the year at this weekend’s Brit awards, where Smith is also nominated for best new artist and best pop act, having already won this year’s Brits Rising Star award.

The Guardian,Why The Brutalist should win the best picture Oscar,"With its awe-inspiring images and ideas and fantastic performances by Adrien Brody and Guy Pearce, the three hours-plus runtime starts to look stingyOK, let’s get this out of the way: yes, The Brutalist is long. Very long. Backside-numbingly long. Which is as you might expect of a decades-spanning tale of a Holocaust survivor architect’s bruising encounter with the American dream. Still, that three-and-a-half hour run time seems to have been presented as Exhibit A in the case against Brady Corbet’s film; that it’s too grand, too ambitious, too full of itself. It’s got a bloody interval, for Christ’s sake! Who does this Corbet fella think he is?Which seems strange, because a lot of what the film has been criticised for is usually seen as an asset. For good or ill, American cinema’s high-water marks, from Citizen Kane to The Godfather and beyond, tend to be big, muscular movies that believe they have something profound to say about the country of their making. And The Brutalist certainly has things to say, however you feel about how it goes about saying them: about art and patronage, the US’s relationship with Europe, and the relentless churn of capitalism. With so many weighty ideas to pack in, that run time starts to look, if anything, a little stingy. Continue reading...","Fri, 28 Feb 2025 14:30:11 GMT",0.8402,0.9312

So keenly did I loathe going to the shops that I just didn’t spend much money. I was perfectly happy, albeit a little bored and usually dressed in the same clothes.Then online shopping happened. The lure of one-click, next-day consumables unleashed my inner impulse buyer like a starving castaway at a buffet. I never quite became a shopping addict, but the thrill of home delivery fuelled a period of slightly unhinged affluenza. My house filled with stuff while my bank account drained. I accumulated retro camera kit (70% unused to this day), expensive books about using said camera kit (100% unread) and an untold number of dresses that I bought only because I could send them back for free.

The Guardian,"Yari Club, London WC2: ‘I didn’t expect the robot chef to be simply a deep-fat fryer’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants","The experience really underlines how brilliant humans areYari Club in Covent Garden, London, is a robot yakitori restaurant. I’ll break that down for you. “Robot”, as in the food is prepared by our new mechanical overlords. “Yakitori” is, essentially, meat grilled on small skewers – think tiny Japanese kebabs dipped in sauces. And then, of course, “restaurant”, as in that place where humans once had jobs before the robots took over. Bleeding robots, eh, clanking in here, taking our jobs?In fact, Yari Club’s “robot” sits in the window of the shop, seemingly to taunt passing Michelin-starred chefs who believe the world will cease to spin if these culinary gods are not up by 5am to source fennel pollen and beech sap. Real chefs can be a huge pain: pricey, sulky and fickle. But there are no such problems with the chef at Yari Club, because it’s a big stainless-steel box filled with hot oil. Despite that jaw-dropping, futuristic aspect being trumpeted loudly in all the marketing, this particular robot is, at first glance, hugely disappointing. Less robotic than I’d imagined (or hoped for) and more simply a deeply unattractive kitchen gadget. Skewers of chicken hearts, chicken gizzard, chicken wings and every other imaginable bits of a chicken are loaded on to a pulley, dragged through hot oil for a robotically precise number of minutes to make them succulent, then dipped into a special, sweet, soy-based sauce to finish.

Take the gelatinous success of Instagram accounts such as 70s Dinner Party or the unfathomable cool-ification of devilled eggs. Another thing that’s deserving of a prance back into popularity is Babycham. It’s kitsch in a bottle. Liquid, postwar optimism. And it’s potentially up for a modern revival. Or at least I want it to be, so I’m writing a column about it. It’s called manifesting.For those who didn’t live through its heyday, Babycham is a sparkling perry, which is like cider, except made from pears. Originally named Champagne de la Poire, Babycham was created by the Showering cider family from pears they saw going to waste when they were buying from local apple orchards. In a postwar world, Herbert Showering saw the changes in drinking habits among women, and an opportunity to create a drink targeted specifically at them.
