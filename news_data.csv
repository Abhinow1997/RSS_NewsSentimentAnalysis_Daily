The Guardian,"There are no adults in the room: there’s barely a room. This is politics at warp speed, and we know who’s benefiting | Marina Hyde","Fiscal crisis, corruption claims, shenanigans and legal threats. This feels like the week old-style politics sat on a grenade The worst-timed foreign visit by a politician this week was LA mayor Karen Bass deciding to attend the inauguration of the president of Ghana. The second worst might be Rachel Reeves’s decision to push ahead with her China bridge-building trip against a backdrop of market turmoil, soaring UK borrowing costs and the inevitability of rising food prices. But look, maybe have no fear. The chancellor has apparently told all her cabinet colleagues to “cease anti-growth measures” – amazing – and also to come up with specific plans to boost economic activity. I am already picturing her opening the bits of paper from the hat. “Right, I’ve got 20 for ‘build an effing time machine’ and one that just says ‘Pass’. Sorry, Lammy – this isn’t Celebrity Mastermind.”As for auto-satirical lowlights further down the ministerial ladder, do keep your eye on anti-corruption minister Tulip Siddiq. The very regrettable lesson of the past few years in UK politics is that no matter how bad things seem, they can always take on a rosy glow in light of what comes after. The premiership of David Cameron seemed less foolhardy once we were living through the premiership of Theresa May. The premiership of Theresa May seemed less chaotic once we were living through the premiership of Boris Johnson. The premiership of Boris Johnson – well, lettuce not be too hasty. But contemplating the Siddiq situation, was it really so bad that Chris Grayling once gave a ferry contract to a firm with no ferries, considering that these days the anti-corruption minister could have three London properties she’s tied to investigated by the National Crime Agency’s international corruption unit? Siddiq has distanced herself from her deposed aunt’s authoritarian regime in Bangladesh – but not, it seems, from the properties given or made available to her by people with close links to that regime. Either way, we are asked to have full confidence in Keir Starmer’s assertion that he has full confidence in her.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Fri, 10 Jan 2025 15:16:08 GMT",-0.296,-0.9418

Britain can’t face that threat alone | Jonathan Freedland,"The president-elect’s hostility towards other democracies is already clear. There will be no special relationship with him: we should look to Europe Flood the zone with shit. So advised Steve Bannon, onetime chief strategist for Donald Trump, who understood long ago that if you want to get away with an outrageous act, follow it with another and then another. That way, the media will be sure to move on to the newest horror, so forgetting the one before.Trump continues to live by that rule, making it hard to keep up with everything he and his circle do and say – and he’s not even back in office yet.

The Guardian,"Mick Lynch, you’re a legend – and the unapologetic working-class leader the left is missing | Polly Smythe","The outgoing RMT head dismantled pundits one by one on live TV, and showed a new generation why we need trade unionsMick Lynch is the trade union icon who nearly wasn’t. Leaving school at 16 to train as an apprentice electrician, he worked in construction until being blacklisted for his union activities. Unable to find work in the building trade, in 1993 he took a job at Eurostar and became involved with the RMT. Construction’s loss was to be the labour movement’s gain.Lynch was elected general secretary of RMT in 2021, and a year later, the UK’s first national railway strike since 1989 catapulted him into the public eye. He quickly became the face of a revitalised trade union movement. More than that, to his supporters – like those who bought T-shirts with his face on them – he became the combative, unapologetic working-class leader the left has been missing.

On Thursday night, a sharply divided US supreme court declined to ride to his last-minute rescue. In a one-paragraph order, the majority refused to stay his state court sentencing whose genesis lay with payments that Trump allegedly arranged to cover up his purported affair with the adult film actor Stormy Daniels. Last May, a Manhattan jury unanimously found the 45th president guilty of 34 counts of conspiracy and fraud.The supreme court order may also be a harbinger of what awaits the US over the next four years: litigation that again divides the judiciary and the nation.

It missed moderation and while Musk and Weidel giggled a lot and agreed on almost every issue, the sense that they were boring each other became increasingly acute as they droned on about space travel and religious belief rather than the alleged decline of western civilisation.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on the LA fires: Donald Trump’s denial and division fuel climate inaction | Editorial,"Events in California reveal how political obstruction is deepening a climate crisis that needs urgent action to prevent it becoming an irreversible disasterThe wildfires ravaging Los Angeles have killed at least 10 people, displaced 180,000 and scorched about 40 square miles – an inferno driven by fierce winds and severe drought in what should be California’s wet season. It is a sobering reminder that the climate crisis is driving wildfires to become more frequent, intense and destructive – leaving ruined lives, homes and livelihoods in their wake. The US president Joe Biden responded by mobilising federal aid. By contrast the president-elect, Donald Trump, a convicted felon who was criminally sentenced on Friday, used the disaster to spread disinformation and stoke political division.The climate crisis knows no national borders. Deadly floods in Spain, Hawaii’s fires and east Africa’s devastating drought show nowhere is safe from its effects. Countries must work toward the global common interest and beyond their narrow national interests. The scale of the climate emergency is such that there is a case to view all crises through a green lens. Instead Mr Trump’s denialism works to foment distrust about the science. He’s not just aiming to delay the onset of truth. He wants to demolish it. It’s a familiar playbook: the fossil fuel industry knows the reality of the climate emergency but chooses profit over responsibility, effectively deceiving the public while the planet burns.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Magnus Carlsen’s power play: checking chess’s ruling body in style | Editorial,"The latest controversy reveals deeper tensions about who will shape the sport’s future: its greatest players or the governing authoritiesA persuasive case can be made that Magnus Carlsen is the greatest chess player of all time. The 34-year‑old Norwegian is no longer world champion – bored with classic (long-form) chess, he chose not to defend his title in 2023 – but his name resonates with the public more than ever. This is not due to his expertise in the Sicilian Defence but because chess’s world governing body, Fide, recently barred him from playing in a tournament for wearing jeans. “Jeansgate” illustrates that while the public may care little for the niceties of chess openings, they are captivated by the eccentricities of the chess world.The fabulous (often chess-inspired) costumes in Netflix’s drama hit The Queen’s Gambit made style magazines swoon. But in real life, chess and fashion rarely intersect, though the great Cuban world champion of the 1920s, José Raúl Capablanca, was a splendidly natty dresser who would never have been seen dead in a pair of jeans, and American world champion, Bobby Fischer, in his 1960s and early 70s pomp, sported bespoke suits, shirts and shoes. Fischer’s later decline – wandering Budapest in a dishevelled state – unfortunately mirrors the stereotype of chess players as a marginalised, shabbily attired community.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"From racism to ableism, Of Mice and Men still sparks a debate | Letters","Readers respond to a piece by Nels Abbey on the book’s place in schools and share their perspectives as students and teachersHaving taught Of Mice and Men for 30 years in multicultural schools in London, I wholeheartedly agree that it is a difficult, problematic novel to teach in secondary school classrooms, particularly because of some of the characters using racist slurs (Would you drop Of Mice and Men from the exam syllabus? The answer isn’t black and white, 6 January). However, to imply that it is educationally redundant does not acknowledge other important positive messages it contains, still relevant today, that do not appear in less problematic alternatives.During the 1930s, John Steinbeck was inspired by marine biologist and ecologist Ed Ricketts to describe how survival ultimately depends on diverse individuals or groups collaborating and working towards collective benefits. In his novels, Steinbeck champions the inclusive diverse group over the individuals holding power. He provides a counter argument to the sweeping enthusiasm for eugenics in California at that time.

The Guardian,The Guide #173: Why Netflix and Spotify don’t seem to care if we are paying attention,"In this week’s newsletter: From Spotify’s bland ghost artists to Netflix’s ‘will this do?’ roster of movies, have audiences succumbed to the age of distraction?Over Christmas, two articles were released that felt like harbingers – if not full-on sirens – for the direction of travel of popular culture. There was Will Tavlin’s piece for n+1 about Netflix’s less-than-stellar film output, which was briefly touched on in last week’s newsletter. And in Harpers magazine, there was an extract from music journalist Liz Pelly’s new book on Spotify. It focuses on the streamer’s Perfect Fit Content (PFC) programme, which pays production companies to create cheap, generic music by “ghost artists” in order, Pelly alleges, to populate Spotify’s playlists and reduce royalty payouts to real artists. (In Pelly’s book Spotify acknowledges the existence of the Perfect Fit Content programme but denies that it is trying to increase the share of streams of Perfect Fit Content.) Both are eye-opening reads, depicting the two companies as industry disruptors with little or no care for the thing they’re disrupting, and making their respective industries worse in the process.But if Netflix and Spotify are cast as the villains of these stories, it is clear that we, the consumers, have a degree of complicity. Both streamers are, after all, simply adapting to, and profiting from, our viewing and listening habits. Two striking details from those articles underline this. Tavlin, in his piece, claims that screenwriters for Netflix movies are being asked by execs to include scenes where characters “announce what they’re doing so that viewers who have this program on in the background can follow along”. Meanwhile, Pelly notes in her piece that Spotify’s “internal research showed that many users were not coming to the platform to listen to specific artists or albums; they just needed something to serve as a soundtrack for their days, like a study playlist or maybe a dinner soundtrack … listeners often weren’t even aware of what song or artist they were hearing.” Continue reading...","Fri, 10 Jan 2025 17:00:39 GMT",0.4939,0.9564

But in 2002, Capcom revealed five exclusives to boost the beleaguered platform – and among them was Resident Evil 4, technically the 13th title in the franchise, which on its release three years later would be considered its zenith. It was an exciting new lease of life for the survival horror genre.Not that you’d guess all this from the game’s extraordinarily pedestrian setup. Six years after the fall of the Umbrella Corporation smouldering cop Leon Kennedy has been dispatched on a mission to retrieve the US president’s kidnapped daughter, who has been spotted in a tiny village in rural Spain.

There are proudly British ingredients – Hebridean hogget, Cornish monkfish and crown prince pumpkin. And they’re cooked with Thai expertise in a kitchen led by John Chantarasak, who was brought up in Wales and trained at Le Cordon Bleu in Bangkok, where his father was born, and who, alongside his wife, sommelier and co-owner Desiree, has been beloved by the London food scene for several years now. Many new restaurants are said to be “much anticipated”, but in AngloThai’s case it has been anticipated for so many years now that many had given up hope of it ever becoming a reality.But you realise almost the moment you walk through the door where all that time went, because creating something as beautiful as this takes money and a great deal of planning. You need an interior created by Thai-American designer May Redding, complete with strategically placed Lampang Province ceramics to help attract a clientele who’ll be happy to stump up the £30 supplement to add Brixham crab, caviar and coconut crackers to their tasting menu. This isn’t Soho or Shoreditch; this is a smart restaurant close to Edgware Road where Anglo and Thai influences collide with the requisite levels of pomp and fire.
