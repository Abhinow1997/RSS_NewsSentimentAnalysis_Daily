The charity proposed paying her £100,000 but this was blocked by the commission and she was eventually hired on £85,000.Hannah Ingram-Moore received £18,000 from Virgin Media in September 2021 to judge its Local Legends awards when she was chief executive of the foundation. This was unauthorised and a conflict of interest, and there was no evidence it was undertaken, as she claimed, in a personal capacity.The Ingram-Moores used the charity’s name inappropriately and for their private benefit in a planning application to build a private spa pool in the grounds of their family home.

The Guardian,After the Party review – hands down the best acting on TV all year,"Peter Mullan is perfectly cast and Robyn Malcolm delivers the performance of 2024 in this dark, provocative drama about a woman who accuses her husband of a sex act with a minorIt’s a bravura performance from the very beginning, when Robyn Malcolm as middle-aged teacher Penny Wilding delivers an impromptu lecture – warm, wise, compassionate and shorn of euphemisms – to her students after one is caught watching pornography on his phone. There are protocols for this sort of thing, her headteacher has informed her, but it’s quicker and more effective to do it her way.After the Party explores what happens when an unstoppable force meets an amorphous, ungraspable object. Five years ago, Penny witnessed – or believes she witnessed – her husband Phil (Peter Mullan) engaging in a sex crime at his birthday party with a drunken underage friend of their daughter, Grace (Tara Canton), and confronted him furiously in front of their guests. As the scene unfolds in flashbacks from different points of view over six episodes, we see Phil reacting with the outraged innocence of – well, the innocent. Or is it the well-honed performance of a practised predator? Mullan, with his ability to suggest inescapable menace lurking beneath everyman bonhomie, is perfect casting.

Here he talks about finding beauty and hope in the age of extinction and despairRichard Flanagan had only just got home from a trek through the wilderness when “the phone started going off like a chainsaw revving”. The day before, he had been standing in a grove of 1,000-year-old pencil pines, trees that he fears may not be around in a decade, such is the effect of the climate crisis on alpine heathland and rainforest in his native Tasmania, Australia. But now, on the other side of the world, his book Question 7 had just been awarded the Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction, making him the first writer to win both this and the Booker, which he received in 2014 for The Narrow Road to the Deep North.Flanagan’s prerecorded acceptance speech initially followed customary form, thanking the prize’s judging panel, his fellow shortlisted writers and its sponsors, the investment management company that gives the award its name and which in recent times has become the focus of intense scrutiny over its ties to the fossil fuel industry. His soul would be troubled, Flanagan explained, if he did not draw attention to the devastating impact the climate crisis was having on his own country and to urge Baillie Gifford to meet with him and outline a plan for its withdrawal from any involvement in fossil fuels. Until that time, continued the 63-year-old, he would delay taking receipt of the £50,000 prize money. “As each of us is guilty,” he concluded, “each of us too bears a responsibility to act: a writer, a fund manager.” Continue reading...","Wed, 20 Nov 2024 17:14:05 GMT",0.1531,0.9032
The Guardian,"Young, British and Anti-Abortion review – surely gen Z are too smart to devalue women’s lives like this?","This documentary meets the young people trying to fight against reproductive rights – and exposes the problems in their world viewDocumentary-maker Poppy Jay’s new film has a title guaranteed to make my hackles rise, and perhaps the hackles of many others in a country that polls nearly 90% support for a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy: Young, British and Anti-Abortion. It’s an investigation into gen Z’s increasing presence among those who would seek to circumscribe or cancel that right. It looks at how they are looking to reposition the debate as a human rights issue rather than a religious one, and how they are emboldened by the overturning of Roe v Wade in the US two years ago. Jay meets a variety of young activists who hope that once again when the US sneezes, we will catch cold.Eden McCourt does most of her work for Abortion Resistance through TikTok. She says that though she is religious (a Google search reveals that she is a writer for the Catholic Herald), her views are secular and were formed largely through the experience of her parents refusing to terminate a pregnancy because the foetus had a severe, life-limiting genetic disorder. Instead her mother gave birth to her sister, Josephine, who died when she was four, but was “the happiest child I ever met”. Continue reading...","Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:40:29 GMT",0.7964,-0.09

I am a biologist by background, and did my PhD research in rainforest ecology in Borneo, before I went into photography and film-making. I saw so much destruction in the rainforest back in the 90s, and it dawned on me that I could publish scientific articles that maybe 10 people would read – or an article in National Geographic that 10 million people would see.I was getting increasingly serious about my photography while working on my PhD when I got funding from the National Geographic Society for field research.

The Guardian,"We’ve lost 20,000 pubs in the last 40 years. That sends a chill down my spine | Adrian Chiles","I don’t spend every night in my local. But even when I’m home, the knowledge that it exists makes life betterA closed pub is a sad, sad sight. Where once was life, people talking and laughing, now there is none. OK, bad stuff would have gone on too. I get that. Every pub has a drinker or two who needs the drink they’re holding more than they should. These places are, after all, potential vectors for dependence on a highly addictive substance, with all the misery that entails. But I think – hope – that pubs do more good than harm, that they’re more of a blessing than a curse.Like most drinkers, I’m inclined to imagine that most of the population drink about the same as me, if not more, and in similar places. When the first lockdown was announced, including, unthinkably, the closing of pubs, Boris Johnson said he found it wrenching to be “taking away the ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom to go to the pub”. I happened to watch him make that speech on a TV in my local pub – it was my birthday. I’m sure I nodded in agreement, though even then I thought it was a bit of a stretch to make the right to go to the pub sound like it was enshrined in Magna Carta. And when I checked, I found that only about half of adults regularly frequent pubs and bars. So not everyone, by a long shot, exercises their inalienable right, although that leaves no small number who do.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:57:38 GMT",-0.3182,0.9257
The Guardian,"With Trump heading for the White House, the Democrats must learn these lessons – and fast | Owen Jones","An economic populism for the majority – irrespective of gender, race, religion or sexual orientation – is the way forwardDid the Democrats really lose because they were too “woke”, too obsessed with minorities, too radical? After defeat, there always comes the battle for the narrative about why the party lost. As the US left is rediscovering, the most influential voices tend to be those platformed by corporate media outlets whose siren cry is always to march rightwards. And yet even the New York Times concluded that one of the main problems was in fact Kamala Harris’s “Wall Street-approved economic pitch”, which her brother-in-law – chief legal officer at Uber – reportedly helped craft, and which “fell flat”.The liberal order, always riddled with hypocrisies and illusions, is collapsing, partly because mainstream liberals cannot be trusted to defend liberalism: they are set to conclude that Trumpism must be defeated through imitation. But here’s a polling fact that cannot be ignored. In the past 50 years, the number of Americans who believe the Democrats “represent the working class” has plummeted, while the numbers who believe they “stand up for marginalised groups” has dramatically risen, now exceeding the former.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But Trump’s cabinet selections would have startled even the character of Captain Louis Renault in Casablanca, who feigned surprise at discovering gambling in the backroom of Rick’s Café before pocketing his winnings: “I’m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!” Continue reading...","Wed, 20 Nov 2024 11:00:05 GMT",-0.8126,-0.2124
The Guardian,Our politics could not be more different – but we’re united against this dangerous assisted dying bill | Diane Abbott and Edward Leigh,"There can be no safeguards that would prevent an assisted dying law from being abused. It must remain illegalLabour MP Diane Abbott and Conservative MP Edward Leigh are the mother and father of the HouseReport: Diane Abbott and Sir Edward Leigh urge Commons to reject assisted dying billFree votes on conscience matters are comparatively rare in the UK parliament. But they are almost always about issues of once-in-a-generation social change. Laws such as this need the utmost care because of the risk of unintended consequences. This is especially the case with the current assisted dying bill.Writing from opposite benches as the father and mother of the house, our concerns are twofold, relating both to the process regarding the bill and its likely practice once implemented. Regarding the process, we have seen our fair share of bills over the years: some good, some bad. Whatever the merits of a bill, laws are always better if there is proper scrutiny and plenty of expert advice has been sought. This is particularly the case with private members’ bills, which often do not enjoy the independent scrutiny that government lawyers can offer.

That’s nice – but let’s stop fawning over a guy who fawns over Trump | Arwa Mahdawi,"Meta’s ‘awkward dork’ boss has updated his haircut and his wardrobe – and shown the world how much family means to him. He’s still a billionaire with skeletons in the cupboardDo they hand out Nobel prizes for PR? Because the team behind Mark Zuckerberg’s recent metamorphosis deserves one immediately. Not so long ago, Zuck was widely known as an awkward dork with an unflattering haircut, whose corporate empire did evil things such as fuelling genocidal violence in Myanmar, spreading misinformation and harvesting people’s personal information.Now, however, the tech mogul keeps making headlines for far fluffier reasons. This has been the year of the Zucknaissance, with people marvelling over his jazzy new wardrobe and far more flattering hair. In what may be an effort to seem more relatable, he has made his private life a lot more public. It’s not clear whether Zuckerberg, who has been married to Priscilla Chan for 12 years, has always been a fan of the big romantic gesture, but he certainly now seems to want to be known as a major “wife guy”.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Donald Trump’s plutocrats: money for something | Editorial,"The Republicans were always the party of big business, but Mr Trump is turning them into a playpen for oligarchsOne person turns up surprisingly often at Donald Trump’s side. Not his No 2, JD Vance, nor his wife, Melania, but another man a quarter-century younger and about $300bn heavier: Elon Musk. The two hunkered down in Mar-a-Lago on the night of the election, celebrating the results. This week they were in Texas, watching Mr Musk’s staff test-launch a spacecraft. During the campaign, Mr Musk personally chipped in $130m, made speeches at rallies and organised campaigns to “get out the vote”. Last week, the world’s richest man was picked by the president-elect to run a new “department of government efficiency”. So close are the pair that Mr Musk dubs himself “First Buddy”.American politics has always been coiled around money, tight as a vine around a trunk. Nearly 25 years ago, George W Bush joked at a swanky white-tie dinner:&nbsp;“Some people call you the elites; I call you my base.” Nor is it confined to the right wing. Of the two main candidates in this month’s election, more billionaires backed Kamala Harris. One result is a highly warped politics that works against the very people it urges to go out and vote.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on the politics of buses: Labour’s winning ticket | Editorial,"Cheap, better-run public transport can transform people’s everyday lives. The government should be more ambitious in its plans to deliver itSix years ago, when Jeremy Corbyn focused on failing bus services during prime minister’s questions, the then leader of the Labour opposition was greeted with mirth and derision. Tory backbenchers amused themselves with shouts of “Taxi!”, as Mr Corbyn urged Theresa May to give metro mayors the powers to take the industry back under public control. To a certain kind of Westminster mind, buses were far too parochial a concern to warrant the political centre-stage. But Mr&nbsp;Corbyn proved to be on the right side of history.By January 2025, all of Greater Manchester’s bus services will be part of the publicly run Bee Network. Since launching two years ago – after lengthy legal battles in which the private sector fought re-regulation tooth and nail – the franchise model has delivered impressively on mayor Andy Burnham’s vision of a low-fare, high-patronage service for the region. A buses bill soon to be introduced by Louise Haigh, the transport secretary, will give local authorities across England new powers to follow suit. Plans are already under way to replicate the approach in Liverpool City Region and West Yorkshire.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Fourteen years of Conservative budget cuts have resulted in my own local authority plummeting from being one of the highest-performing “beacon” authorities in England to one that is now in debt and heading towards the bottom rung of the ladder.The closure of children’s centres, care homes and budget cuts in every service area, from special needs education and social care to library services, have resulted in a threadbare support network locally.

The Guardian’s own Richard Gott stood for the Radical Alliance in the 1966 North Hull byelection.

The Outdoor Swimming Society says that several million people in the UK now take to rivers, lakes, lidos and seas each year. Their main motivation? Joy, with 94% saying they felt happier and less stressed after a swim.Team GB’s five-medal haul – one gold and four silvers – at the Paris Olympic Games 2024 likely encouraged more people to take up or return to the sport, too.

The Guardian,My Brilliant Friend season four review – every episode of this stunning drama is like a mini movie,"One of TV’s finest series in years reaches its end with a gorgeous finale. This Elena Ferrante adaptation is rich, sumptuous and deliciously overwrought – it truly is a wonderHaving adapted Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels over three superlative series so far, My Brilliant Friend comes to a conclusion with its take on the fourth and final book, The Story of the Lost Child. Like its outstanding previous seasons, this Italian drama continues to be rich, sumptuous and deliciously overwrought, but at the same time thoughtful and surprisingly delicate. This beautiful take on Ferrante’s work has done nothing but impress since the very beginning, and it goes out on a high.For the first time since season one, Lenù and Lila have been recast, with Alba Rohrwacher replacing Margherita Mazzucco and Irene Maiorino taking over from Gaia Girace. We rejoin Lenù in the late 1970s, when her writing career has truly taken off. As she travels Europe to give readings and speeches, her affair with Nino Sarratore (now played by Fabrizio Gifuni) is all-consuming, to the extent that she wonders if she loves him more than she loves her own daughters. The question of whether she loves him (or anyone) more than her work, however, remains an unspoken one, though it is at the heart of this tale.

Baldwin was charged with involuntary manslaughter but the case was dismissed for evidence withholding, while Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the film’s armourer, was sentenced to 18 months in prison on the same charge, and assistant director David Halls given six months probation for negligent use of a deadly weapon. The film’s closing credits now contain a tribute to Hutchins, with the words “For Halyna” and a quote: “What can we do to make this better?” The festival’s CEO Marek Żydowicz said that Baldwin, who is credited as one of Rust’s producers, was not invited.

To that list, in the section where further disclosure is still urgently required, we should add the UK’s nuclear testing scandal. This calmly scathing documentary sets out the case.Post-second world war, the US and the USSR engaged in a nuclear arms race, and Britain – desperate to cling to its place at the world’s top table – felt obliged to join them. As it tried to keep up with developments in atomic and hydrogen bombs, nuclear tests were desired, but letting off nukes anywhere near regular British citizens was politically unviable, so distant lands were sought and human guinea pigs identified.

The Guardian,We Who Wrestle With God by Jordan Peterson review – a culture warrior out of his depth,"The popular psychologist’s blinkered reading of the Bible does his cause no favoursIt is not easy to review any book by Jordan Peterson, the prolific Canadian psychologist turned lifestyle sage. The temptation is to respond not to the work but the person (or persona): irascible, derisive, uncompromising, contrarian. But here, the work itself poses problems; it is a sprawling, repetitive text that could have done with some ruthless editing. Ostensibly a step-by-step guide through the biblical narratives of Genesis and Exodus (and, for some reason, Jonah), with the goal of uncovering wisdom to help meet present-day moral challenges, it in fact returns persistently to some of Peterson’s favourite tropes about modern culture, its flabbiness and confusion.At one level its structure and argument are clear enough. The scriptural text confronts us, says Peterson, with a set of life-and-death choices. We can conform our rebellious fantasies and myth-driven aspirations to the underlying moral structure of reality, or we can refuse. If we refuse, we wreck our own lives and those of others. If instead we recognise reality, we then face two sorts of pressure. Continue reading...","Wed, 20 Nov 2024 09:00:33 GMT",0.2732,-0.8835

The Guardian,How to cook the perfect aloo bhorta,"This traditional Bengali combination of sticky mashed spuds, onion, chilli and spices punches way above its weight. But is there a definitive version?Bhorta is, Kolkata-native chef Asma Khan explains, the Bengali pronunciation of the Hindi word bharta, meaning mashed – it’s an important distinction, too, because, although spiced mashed vegetables, seafood or meat are found in many regions of the Indian subcontinent, bhorta is particularly dear to Bangladesh and the neighbouring Indian province of West Bengal.Indeed, according to British Bangladeshi food writer Dina Begum, it’s the “quintessential soul food of Bangladeshi cuisine”, repopularised by post-independence efforts to rediscover the country’s culinary traditions and served with panta bhat, or fermented rice, at Pôhela Boishakh (Bengali New Year) celebrations each spring. Adiba and Arafat, the husband and wife team behind the Spice Odyssey website, write that: “In Bangladesh, a country marked by a huge chasm between the rich and the poor, the once austere mishmash of vegetables … has become the gamechanger – marking the return of the privileged to the food of their forefathers. The gradual incorporation of bhorta … as a celebratory food at home and abroad is a tale of how sharing common food as a ritual can become a marker of cultural and national identity.” Continue reading...","Wed, 20 Nov 2024 12:00:06 GMT",0.5719,0.9538
