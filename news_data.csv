But we do expect to see a shift in dietary habits,” said Emily Nurse, head of net zero at the Climate Change Committee, which on Wednesday published its official advice to the government on meeting the UK’s target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050.

The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Calls grow to spend all of Russia’s frozen billions on Ukrainian defence,"Move from freezing to seizing, says Britain’s Lammy; ‘Czech ammunition initiative’ succeeding. What we know on day 1,099   Calls are growing for hundreds of billions in Russian government wealth frozen in the international banking system to be used in full for Ukraine’s defence. Europe and the G7 have found ways to use interest from the financial assets to help Ukraine in the war, but the capital has remained locked up since the February 2022 invasion. The British foreign secretary, David Lammy, said on Tuesday: “Europe has to act quickly, and I believe we should move from freezing assets to seizing assets. It’s not an issue on which any government can act alone. We must act with European allies.” Petr Fiala, the Czech PM, also said the west should use the money to finance military supplies for Ukraine. European leaders have so far failed to reach agreement on how to seize the money without facing legal challenges or setting a problematic international precedent.Ukraine received 500,000 artillery shells bought outside Europe in 2024 under an initiative run by the Czech Republic, said its prime minister, Petr Fiala. Overall, the Czechs co-ordinated the supply of about 1.5m shells in total in 2024. Eighteen countries including Canada, Germany and Portugal collected about $1.8bn by June 2024 to buy 155mm shells under the banner of the “Czech ammunition initiative”. The Czechs continue to send tens of thousands of shells a month. It marks an improvement from a European effort to send Ukraine a million shells by March 2024 – that stretched out to December 2024 because of production shortages.Moscow has dismissed Donald Trump’s claim that Russia would accept European peacekeeping troops in Ukraine, Pjotr Sauer writes. Addressing reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin had nothing to add to the foreign ministry’s position on the unacceptability of Nato peacekeepers in Ukraine.Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, said that after he returns from seeing Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday, “I am hosting a number of countries at the weekend for us to continue to discuss how we go forward together as allies in light of the situation that we face”.The cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine after three years of Russia’s full-scale invasion will be $524bn over the next decade, according to a report released by the Government of Ukraine, the World Bank Group, the European Commission, and the United Nations.A Russian drone attack injured a 19-year-old woman and set a house on fire in Kyiv oblast, said Mykola Kalashnyk, the regional governor. The city, the region surrounding it and the eastern half of Ukraine came under air raid alerts starting on Tuesday night.A Russian attack on the town of Kramatorsk in Ukraine’s east on Tuesday killed one person and injured at least 14, including four children, Ukrainian national police said. Russian fire hit a residential district, damaging 17 houses. Kramatorsk, part of the Donetsk region, is about 17km from the active combat line and remains a constant target of Russian military attacks.A Russian military court sentenced a man to 16 years in jail after he was accused of providing Ukraine with data on a military site near Moscow and preparing attacks, authorities said on Tuesday.

It is the English-language remake of the Welsh drama Cleddau, by Catherine Tregenna, in which two detectives with a shared past are forced into partnership once more when a new crime has echoes&nbsp;of&nbsp;a historical murder they worked on together. Is it a copycat, or did they put away the wrong man? Could there be another explanation? And when are the&nbsp;two detectives with a shared past going to have&nbsp;sex?So far, so classic premise. If, as I do, you believe it is a classic for a reason, you will already be happy to spend six hours in TOTGA’s warm embrace. If you do not, then you will miss a smartly plotted thriller, set in a Cambrian seaside town, that captures the warm intimacy and chilly bleakness of small-town life. You&nbsp;will also miss a drama that provides an astute portrait of complicated adults with complicated relationships that holds the attention no less than the&nbsp;twisty narrative.

Ulrich Sourisseau’s workshop is in a disused railway station in a remote part of the Black Forest in Germany, and he is in extremely high demand. He’s selective about who he sells his machines to, and if he does agree to make you a bit of kit, he’s a little old-school. “He’s cash-only, so I had to travel there with €7,000 on me,” recalls Jon Downing, who bought one back in 2017.Downing then began running his own micro record label in Sheffield, Do It Thissen (that’s “do it yourself” in Yorkshire dialect), specialising in music from his home region. It was a retirement project “to keep me out of mischief and give something back to the local scene,” he says, but Downing has since put out 75 records, from the wonky weirdo punk of Dearthworms to the psychedelic krautpop of Sister Wives, which he personally cut in his shed at the bottom of the garden.

The Guardian,This is a hard choice. We believe in foreign aid – but we have to make cuts. We must keep the UK safe | David Lammy,"Putin’s Russia is a threat to all Europe, including the UK. Vital aid work will be hit as we spend more on defence, but we must deal with the world as it isThere are moments in history when everything turns, but the extent of change is not perceived until later when the fog has cleared. These are hinge points that require clear leadership and bold action. In the late 1940s, my Labour predecessor and hero Ernie Bevin, alongside Clement Attlee, saw through the fog when they led Britain into Nato and the UN, and secured the development of Britain’s nuclear deterrent. In the 1960s, Harold Wilson saw through the paranoia of the cold war, refusing Lyndon Johnson’s request to send British troops to Vietnam. In the 1990s, Tony Blair understood that unless we stopped the president of Serbia, Slobodan Milošević, there would be no peace in the Balkans.Three years into Vladimir Putin’s brutal war, this is again a hinge point for Britain. Keir Starmer’s commitment to dramatically raise defence spending in both this and the next parliament shows his leadership through the fog. Putin’s Russia is a threat not only to Ukraine and its neighbours, but to all of Europe, including the UK. Over successive administrations, our closest ally, the US, has turned increasingly towards the Indo-Pacific, and it is understandably calling for Nato’s European members to shoulder more of the burden for our continent’s security. Around the world, the threats are multiplying: from traditional warfare to hybrid threats and cyber-attacks.David Lammy is British foreign secretary Continue reading...","Tue, 25 Feb 2025 18:42:26 GMT",0.2144,-0.972
The Guardian,"It’s Elon Musk’s ‘pronatalist’ bonanza – so many families, so little time | Marina Hyde","With the mothers of his kids begging for his attention on social media, he makes much of ‘pronatalism’. Is that just a fancy word for bad parenting?If only Elon Musk could impregnate humans at the same rate he’s giving them the ick. Alas, polls show the efficiency tsar’s US approval rating dwindling towards levels he has enjoyed for quite some time among the UK public. And as a country that lived through the Boris Johnson era, I think we have to warn the Americans that if a government figure can’t or won’t answer the basic question “how many kids do you have?”, then he’s probably going to turn out to be a disappointment. And it might even have been a warning sign. If the WhatsApp group of his exes is bigger than Mumsnet and 10 times as pissed off, then it’s just possible you could be dealing with a guy you’re going to end up feeling betrayed by.Is Musk that guy? Who among us can say, certainly considering the sheer number and ferocity of the lawyers Mister Free Speech employs? I do know Elon is something called a “pronatalist”, but I increasingly wonder whether that’s just a fancy new word for a very old form of shittiness. Consider the spectacle of his ex, Grimes, coming on to the social media platform Musk owns and outright begging him to get in touch for his input concerning a “medical crisis” for one of their shared children. “I’m not giving any details but he won’t respond to texts call or emails and has skipped every meeting and our child will suffer lifelong impairment if he doesn’t respond asap, so I need him to fucking respond and if I have to apply public pressure then I guess that’s where we are at.” These posts were either deleted or are now inaccessible, while one user suggested she had been “shadowbanned”. Silly Grimes. If she had put a rape threat or some antisemitism in her APB, it would have stayed up.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Welcome to Britain in 2025 – where there is a heist in my local shop and no one is surprised | Zoe Williams,"Three young men began stealing all the cigarettes and the staff responded with pure resignation. Society is unspooling before our eyesEverything was going so well in my local Co-op. I’d gone in for vape juice, which they often run out of. I could see my preferred brand and I was having a comradely moment with the assistant, who is only too used to my crestfallen face when I have to make do with blueberry flavour. Then, right next to me, a man started to slither through the adjacent service hatch. The first I made of it was that the friction of his body against the counter was pulling his trousers down. I was close enough to see the whites of his pants, which were not that white. I thought: “That young man should really wear a belt next time he tries to hijack the till-cockpit of a Co-op.” Then: “NO WAY! That young man is hijacking the Co-op!”He was wearing a face bandana, so he had at least got that far with his accessorising, and he yelled at the lady to get out from behind the tills, then let his two friends in. It was a classic in-through-the-trapdoor, open-the-drawbridge manoeuvre. The manager was on the phone to the police, saying in neutral tones: “Robbery in progress, robbers in the building,” as they piled cigarettes into three giant bags-for-life, which they had definitely stolen from their mums in advance. The planning was meticulous. We watched for a few seconds, fascinated. I asked the lady if she thought we should hide and she made a noncommittal noise that I have spent ages since deciphering.

The Guardian,"Is a Trump backlash on its way? Well, eggs are as expensive as ever – and you can’t eat the culture wars | Arwa Mahdawi","The 78-year-old president is the ultimate comeback kid, but he is not a king and he is certainly not a god. As prices rise and consumer sentiment slumps, he may come to regret his election promisesEach new morn, new widows howl, new orphans cry and Donald Trump passes a wild executive order. To&nbsp;liberally paraphrase Macbeth, every day seems to bring some new reason to scream into the void. The good news, however, is that even diehard Trumpers seem to be getting sick of all the chaos. A month into Trump’s second act, there are signs that the honeymoon is over and&nbsp;a backlash may be brewing. For certain Republican voters, regret may be setting in.First, the polling. A Harvard CAPS/Harris survey published on Monday gave Trump a 52% approval rating. Meanwhile, three national polls show a decline in support for the president, with most Americans saying he hasn’t done enough to lower prices and has overstepped his presidential powers. A CNN poll published on Thursday found that 47% of Americans approve of Trump’s performance while 52% disapprove – and the numbers are trending downwards.

The Guardian,A brutal ousting at Unilever? Not really. Boards shouldn’t be sentimental about chief executives | Nils Pratley,"Getting rid of Hein Schumacher may not follow the usual FTSE 100 script, but boards should be free to make clinical judgments if there’s a better optionMost removals of chief executives from FTSE 100 companies follow the same script. Financial results disappoint; the share price falls; improvement is promised but doesn’t materialise; the shares fall further; a beleaguered board, harassed by the shareholders, finally pulls the plug. The process tends to take ages. The exit of Hein Schumacher from Unilever is nothing like that.First, he’s been in the job for little more than 18 months. Second, the numbers for 2024 were OK, even if the revenue line for the fourth quarter was weak-ish. Third, the share price hasn’t been crashing – it’s up 10% since Schumacher’s appointment. Nor does there appear to have been a quarrel over strategy, even if the choice of Amsterdam for the primary listing of the soon-to-be-demerged Magnum and Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice-cream division will not have been universally popular.

The Guardian,"The Guardian view on Starmer’s aid cuts: they won’t buy security, but they will undermine it | Editorial","Labour’s ‘pragmatism’ isn’t neutral – it locks the party into fiscal caution, reinforcing stagnation and fuelling the very instability it seeks to avoidPolitics is about choices. Some are forced on governments by circumstance. Others are self‑imposed. Labour’s decision to cut the aid budget to “pay” for increased defence spending is firmly in the latter category. It is also wrong –&nbsp;forcing the world’s poor to pay for Britain’s safety. This is a false economy. Cutting aid will make the world more unstable, not less. The very crises that fuel conflict – poverty, failed states, climate disasters and mass displacement – will only worsen with less development funding. Labour’s logic is self‑defeating:&nbsp;diverting money from aid to defence does not buy security; it undermines it.The numbers tell the story. Despite government attempts to inflate the amounts involved, the extra £5bn‑£6bn for defence is tiny relative to Britain’s GDP. The UK could easily absorb this through borrowing –&nbsp;especially in a global financial system where sterling is heavily traded – or, if the government prefers, through a modest wealth tax. Yet Sir Keir Starmer has chosen to frame this as a zero-sum game, where aid must give way to security. Why? Because this is not about economic necessity – it’s about political positioning. Labour wants to prove that it can be fiscally disciplined even when the numbers don’t demand it. It wants to neutralise Tory attacks, even when the real battle is over priorities, not affordability.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Trump’s realignment: the geopolitical plates are moving. Brace for further shocks | Editorial,"In siding with Russia at the UN, the US has laid bare the extent of the shift. Bilateral visits cannot disguise the underlying crisisThe rumblings prompted by Donald Trump’s re-election soon gathered force. First came tariffs and threats of territorial annexation; then the greater shocks of JD Vance’s Valentine’s Day massacre of European values and Mr Trump’s enthusiastic amplification of Kremlin lines on Ukraine.On Monday came another seismic moment. For more than a decade, the UN security council has been largely paralysed by the split between the five permanent members – Russia and China on one side; the US, France and Britain on the other. This time, when the US brought a resolution calling for an end to the war in Ukraine on the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion, it did not criticise Moscow, demand its withdrawal or back Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The result was that China and Russia backed the resolution – while the UK and France, having failed to temper it, abstained. Continue reading...","Tue, 25 Feb 2025 18:26:36 GMT",-0.3818,-0.2462
The Guardian,Is Blue Labour really the answer to Keir Starmer’s woes? | Letters,"Jim Denham says Maurice Glasman’s views pander to Faragism, in response to an article by Julian Coman. Plus letters from Austen Lynch and Peter BrookerJulian Coman’s article on “the much misunderstood” Blue Labour says Maurice Glasman’s project fell out of favour because it advocated “restrictions on the import of cheaper migrant labour” (An exiled group within Labour is making a comeback – it could hold the key to repelling Farage, 21 February).The truth is that, interviewed by Progress magazine in April 2011, Glasman advocated opening Labour up to supporters of the far-right English Defence League (EDL). Interviewed in July 2011 by the Daily Telegraph’s Mary Riddell, he doubled down. Asked whether he would support a total ban on immigration, even just for a temporary period, he replied: “Yes. I would add that we should be more generous and friendly in receiving those [few] who are needed. To be more generous we have to draw the line.” In response to a further question on whether he supported Iain Duncan Smith’s call for British jobs for British workers, he responded: “Completely. The people who live here are the highest priority. We’ve got to listen and be with them. They’re in the right place – it’s us who are not.” Continue reading...","Tue, 25 Feb 2025 17:32:26 GMT",-0.4404,0.9685

A utopian vision of homes for 3,000 people. Built in the 1930s, they were modelled on the Karl-Marx-Hof in Vienna and La Cité de la Muette in Paris. However, after just 40 years, the buildings were crumbling and largely deserted. Over the course of five years in the 1970s, Peter Mitchell documented their demolition, from smashed windows and wrecked apartments to abandoned wardrobes and solitary shoes. Finally, when all that was left standing was a lone arch, he tried to photograph the wrecking crew standing in front of it, but couldn’t get the arch in.“So,” Mitchell remembers, “the foreman said, ‘We do have a crane.’ I can’t stand heights but they lowered the crane down so I could stand on it, then lifted me up to quickly get the shot. I was swaying about a bit and all but one of them came out blurred – but I got the picture.” Continue reading...","Tue, 25 Feb 2025 16:08:54 GMT",0.636,-0.3506

It was not my intention to watch a play. They were doing One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. I saw my brother Dino who was playing Big Chief, the Native American guy. I knew Dino from elsewhere in the jail, but not for this.I got involved. I found a fascination for Shakespeare that I really didn’t expect. I didn’t think I’d understand the language.

Felicity Cloake tries out supermarket takes on chilled, ready-made chicken and vegetable soup• The best blenders to blitz like a pro, tried and testedAs a small child, my dream was to open an underwater restaurant (no, me neither), and the short menu I painstakingly wrote out for said venture started with chicken and vegetable soup. Which is to say, I have history with this dish. It feels familiar, comforting and overwhelmingly wholesome, yet I don’t often eat it these days, not least because I’ve never found one commercially that makes any welfare claims for the chicken concerned (and I’m generally too cheap to make it myself).So I was quite excited about this particular taste test – and perhaps inevitably disappointed that even the most expensive samples gave so little information about the provenance of their meat. That said, with a handful of exceptions, the standard was pretty high flavour-wise, and Aldi, Marks &amp; Spencer, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s all at least note that they use British chicken, which is a start.

The Guardian,Make a meal of it: how to jazz up a tin of baked beans | Kitchen aide,"Sausages, cheese, chilli all probably spring immediately to mind, but have you considered wine or sage instead?How can I make a tin of baked beans tastier?
 “You’ve come to the right place,” says food writer Melek Erdal. “One of my most popular recipes ever was jazzed-up beans on toast, which came out of lockdown, when we were all utilising everything.” Essentially, when it comes to injecting flavour into baked beans, it’s all about the base, and for Erdal that means toasting spices (cumin seeds, ground coriander, aleppo chilli) in an ovenproof pan, then adding “the magic triangle”, namely ginger, garlic and chilli, and some oil. “Add the beans, crumble feta on top, then pop it in the oven until the top caramelises.” Erdal might also add a drizzle of tahini, “for a take on shakshuka, and a lovely brunch or lunch.”In a similar riffable vein, Eleanor Maidment, author of Pulse, makes a base of chorizo and red peppers, then adds beans and poaches some eggs in them. Cured meat is, of course, always a good idea, too: “Baked beans are quite sweet, so savoury things work really well with them,” Maidment says. “Fry onions and bacon, then add the beans and a splash of Worcestershire sauce, say.”Got a culinary dilemma?

The Guardian,This must be the place: the rise of single-vineyard wines,"The wine zeitgeist is that place is now more important than time, but labelling bottles as hyper local is not as trainspottery as it soundsOver the centuries, winemakers have come up with all sorts of systems and terminology to talk up the quality of their wines. One of the best known and still most widely used rankings singles out time as the most important factor: the basic thinking behind classifying a rioja reserva or gran reserva as in some way special is that the longer a wine has spent ageing in barrel and bottle before it is released, the more refined it will be.For the Germans, preoccupied with ripeness in what was, pre-climate crisis, a difficult place to ripen grapes consistently, it made more sense to build a vinous hierarchy based on sugar rather than oak, in which the higher the levels of sugar in the grape must at harvest, the better the wine should be, from the lowest and lightest, kabinett, to the intensely sweet and concentrated late-harvested, “dry-berries” of trockenbeerenauslese.

We lived in a house nearby, or in tents pitched in the garden. Every day, we walked up to the orphanage to put on developmental activities, sporting events, solve puzzles, play games, stage shows and go on camping trips.I volunteered at the orphanage, in the village of Belskoye Ustye, for almost a decade, but it was the first visit that made the biggest impression. I had seen nothing like it. My closest reference point was probably workhouses or orphanages from a Charles Dickens novel. I vividly remember the smells – cooked food, unwashed bodies, chlorine and urine – and how the children crowded you, grabbing hands and clothes, pinching, pulling hair, jostling and asking questions. Dressed in an odd collection of what seemed to be adult castoffs, the kids spent most of their waking hours in rooms furnished with just a few scuffed tables and chairs, a bookcase and television. At night, and for long periods during the day, cast-iron metal grilles across corridors were locked, confining the older teenagers to their dormitories at one end.
