The Guardian,Swiped: The School That Banned Smartphones review – makes you long to lock your own device in a box,"This three-week experiment to study the horrifying effects of the grim content that children can access 24/7 has predictable results – which are nonetheless horrifyingAs a rule, jealousy is not an emotion social experiment TV tends to elicit. To gain insight into the human condition, such programmes usually involve nightmare-level punishments: volunteers agree to sleep on the street or go to prison or marry a total stranger or live like a Victorian person or be marooned on a desert island – the genre is schadenfreude central. Yet watching Swiped: The School That Banned Smartphones – which follows a group of year 8 pupils from Essex (plus hosts Matt and Emma Willis) as they surrender their phones to a lockable glass cube for three whole weeks – my response is one of pure envy. What a treat. If only a production company would be so kind as to take my phone away from me.Swiped, says Dr Rangan Chatterjee as he guides us through the technicalities of the experiment, marks the first time a digital detox has been studied on this scale. This is probably not the coup it first seems. Science has been slow to solidify a causal relationship between smartphone usage and mental health issues, but every sentient being with social media access knows how detrimental an endlessly refreshing feed is to sleep, concentration, inner peace and general happiness. Let’s just say the final data isn’t the most earth-shattering discovery of our time: if your smartphone leaves you distracted, exhausted and anxious, chances are it’s doing the same to your child.

The Guardian,"The cochlear question: as the parent of a deaf baby, should I give her an implant to help her hear?","Cochlear implantation is controversial in ways that parallel medical situations – such as artificial limbs and cornea transplants – are not. Why does this issue provoke such fierce debate?This essay first appeared under the title The Cochlear Question on Aeon.coI knew my daughter could hear: not just because she loved music, but because she had perfect rhythm. She punched her fists in the air like a human metronome, and brought a doughy heel to the ground precisely on each downbeat. I had thrown off the yoke of milestone-tracking months earlier, having become fixated on her inability to roll during the precise developmental week for rolling. So when she didn’t form consonants at the prescribed time, I made a deliberate choice to ignore it. It didn’t occur to me that deafness might not be a binary, and that certain vibrations and pitches – the downbeat of a song by toddler-music group the Wiggles, say – could be apprehended, while other subtle speech sounds might be snatched out of a sentence. So it was a couple of months after her first birthday when we discovered that our Botticellian baby had mild hearing loss, and two years after that when she lost almost all of her remaining hearing entirely.Like most hearing parents of deaf children, my first close relationship with a deaf person was with my child. Despite a relatively broad cultural education, I knew next to nothing about hearing loss or deaf culture. What little I had absorbed was an incomplete and almost entirely inaccurate patchwork of pop culture snippets – the mother’s horror when her baby doesn’t react to the fire engine’s siren in the film Mr Holland’s Opus (1995); Beethoven’s struggle to hear the first performance of his Ninth Symphony; the lift scene in Jerry Maguire (1996) where the loving boyfriend signs “you complete me” to his partner; Quasimodo’s apparent industrial deafness from the bells of Notre-Dame; and, worst of all, the appalling memory of my university housemate imitating a deaf accent for laughs. This bleak landscape of ignorance and misinformation is often the lookout from which parents begin making decisions, as deaf critics have rightly pointed out. But although I began educating myself belatedly, it didn’t take long for the calcified layers of assumptions and approximations to disintegrate. Chief among them was the unquestioned belief that hearing loss, for an early deafened person, is even a loss at all. Continue reading...","Wed, 11 Dec 2024 23:59:02 GMT",0.4019,-0.9734
The Guardian,‘Sexuality is as individual as a fingerprint’: Daniel Craig and Luca Guadagnino on Queer,"In their feverish film, Craig plays a man embroiled in a drug-fuelled gay affair. He and director Guadagnino talk about love, ageing – and a forgotten sex actThere is no shortage of directors who have made movies about gay life only to then backtrack and claim they were not specifically gay stories after all: Tom Ford did it with A Single Man, William Friedkin with both Cruising and The Boys in the Band. Luca Guadagnino, the director of Call Me By Your Name and this year’s steamy tennis romcom Challengers, is not about to play that game. “It is the most gigantic gay film in history,” he says of his latest picture, for which he recreated 1950s Mexico City on 12 stages at the Cinecittà studios in Rome. “I don’t think there has ever been a bigger gay movie.” Then again, he doesn’t have much wriggle room: the film is called Queer.His feverish adaptation of William S Burroughs’s novel, which was written in the early 1950s but not published until 1985, concerns an American expat, William Lee, who locks eyes with a young stranger across a crowded cockfight. This is Eugene Allerton, a clean-cut, blade-like presence, played by Drew Starkey. And who should star as Lee, the gauche, fumbling, sweaty goofball, but Daniel Craig? If No Time to Die hadn’t killed off James Bond, Queer would have done it in a trice. Continue reading...","Wed, 11 Dec 2024 18:00:03 GMT",0.0,-0.2495

Life hadn’t been quite this good for the Tories since Margaret Thatcher’s days. They couldn’t believe their luck as they bathed in the unbearable smugness of being. They would be in government for another 10 years at a bare minimum. The Labour party? Who were they again? Remind me.Fast forward to the present day and the Tories are a hollowed-out rump with a mere 121 MPs. And the more intelligent Conservatives are thankful to have that many. Few think there is any easy way back for the party. The main lesson from the July election wasn’t how much people loved Labour: it was how much everyone hated the Tories.

The Guardian,What comes next for Syria’s women? A revolution that doesn’t free them is no revolution at all | Mona Eltahawy,"The women celebrating the destruction of jails and dungeons will now be wondering why their own oppression cannot also be dismantledThirteen years after they joined the revolutionary wave sweeping across the Middle East and north Africa, Syrians can say they have consigned the name of Bashar al-Assad to the history books alongside Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia, Muammar Gaddafi of Libya and Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen. But as the past 13 years have shown in all those countries, liberation requires more than removing one man from the presidential palace. We women, especially, know that.Today I am thinking of Razan Zaitouneh, a Syrian revolutionary who along with three of her comrades, collectively known as the Douma Four, disappeared in rebel-held territory on 9 December 2013 – 11 years less a day before Assad was toppled. Zaitouneh’s revolution targeted everyone: the Assad regime, rebel groups and Islamist militants alike.Mona Eltahawy is the author of the Feminist Giant newsletter.

The Guardian,Worried about what to buy the man in your life for Christmas? The perfect gift may be more modest than you think | Joel Snape,"If you really care, get us an upgrade of a bargain-basement product you’ve spotted us using. Our gratitude will be eternalWhen I was a small boy, socks were the inverse of a Platonically ideal present – the last resort of a tragically unimaginative relative, correctly derided in the Beano as the worst possible gift. Now that I’m a 45-year-old dad, though, I’ve done a 180 – few things make me happier on Christmas morning than the tell-tale crinkle of a floppy, foot-shaped gift. Maybe this is what being a grownup really means.I think it’s because, as you age, you tend to invest in fewer luxuries for yourself. Fine, I’m not above a subscription box of IPAs or some nice fineliners, but when it comes to the essentials of life, I buy … the basics. A set of AirPods? You can get a set of Bluetooth headphones for less than £20. Designer glasses? Not when I look so stylish in my nerd-frames. A six-pack of white athletic socks? Yes, please — throw in a pack of plain T-shirts while you’re at it. Continue reading...","Wed, 11 Dec 2024 23:59:02 GMT",0.6597,0.9292

The Guardian,Starmer’s Labour knows the kind of Britain it wants – it just doesn’t know how to build it | Martin Kettle,"Ministers are right to want to reform the state: it’s crucial to their project. But simply telling civil servants to work harder won’t achieve itAfter five months in office, Labour knows where it wants to take the country; but it does not know how to get there. In this, and despite radically different priorities, the Labour government resembles the Conservative one that preceded it. Boris Johnson found in the end that he could not make modern Britain work in the way he wanted. Now, today, it is Keir Starmer’s turn.Starmer’s “plan for change” speech at Pinewood Studios last week was a recognition of the problem. British government, said Starmer, is “broken”. It was a striking admission, but also true in many ways, prisons and social care prominent among them. Starmer responded by announcing five-year targets in key policy areas – the economy, housing, health, policing, early years and energy. But this was not enough. Starmer’s answer does not measure up to the problem that confronts him.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Wed, 11 Dec 2024 17:14:19 GMT",0.0,0.6486
The Guardian,The unhinged presentation of Muslims on GB News has been exposed.

Meanwhile the archbishop of Canterbury is apparently doing “more to promote Islam than Christianity”.Oh dear. Welcome to the unhinged alternative reality configured on GB News, where conspiracy theories about the Muslim takeover of British institutions and society are not simply fringe comments whispered in deep, dark corners of the internet (the archbishop prioritising Islam over Christianity is, after all, quite a feat), but primetime television fare.

The Guardian,It’s not bigotry to worry about migration – the latest figures tell a complex story | Larry Elliott,"Large parts of Britain would not function without migrants, but there are consequences for housing, GDP and productivityRecord NHS waiting lists. Flatlining living standards. Rising levels of long-term sickness. The dire state of the public finances. The list of problems inherited from the Conservatives by Keir Starmer is long, but near the top is how to respond to record levels of net migration.According to official estimates released last month, the past three years have seen almost 2.4 million more people arrive in the UK than have left. Over the centuries, inward migration has been a feature of this country’s history, but the speed and scale of the recent increases are new. In the 1960s and 1970s, emigration tended to be higher than immigration and it has only been in the past quarter of a century that net migration began its upward trend. By way of comparison, net migration in the three years leading up the Brexit vote in 2016 stood at 865,000.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Does the bizarre reaction to the killing of a health insurance boss make sense? Only in America | Emma Brockes,"Joyful memes, novelty merch, gushing support: it’s undeniably callous, but points to a deeply dysfunctional systemFor the almost two decades I lived in the US, my approach to medical bills was always the same. First invoice, ignore. Second invoice, ignore. Third invoice, written entirely in capital letters and in red, kick back to my insurer to buy another month of non-payment before receiving a fourth invoice, which I would also ignore. After that, the bill would go to a debt collection agency in the midwest, which would send me an extremely unfriendly letter threatening court action if I didn’t pay up. I paid up. Ha! That’ll show ’em.This is the rigmarole that millions of Americans go through every single time they visit a doctor for anything beyond routine maintenance. It is simultaneously a standard experience and a trigger for the most overpowering, cortisol-releasing emotions. Dragging my heels until the final notice was a pathetic gesture that achieved nothing, but it was the only mechanism I had for expressing the unadulterated rage caused by a basic fact of life in the US: that – and there’s no other way to word this – you pay these fuckers enormous amounts of money each year and still they fight you on everything.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on politicians using business logic: public services aren’t startups | Editorial,"When an insecure government borrows credibility from business leaders, a lot can go wrongA new government, anxious over economic policy and fretful about its polling, invites business leaders to whip Whitehall into shape. That was Rachel Reeves, ordering ministers a few days ago to submit their spending plans to corporate executives. Among those wielding an “iron fist against waste” will be former bankers from Lloyds and Barclays. But it was also David&nbsp;Cameron in the summer of 2010, bringing in Sir&nbsp;Philip Green as his efficiency guru.From day one, Sir Philip’s appointment raised eyebrows. Just weeks before the general election, the “king of the high street” had endorsed the Tories to be the next government; now he too was part of it. Besides, what right did a billionaire have to audit public spending with so many questions over his own tax affairs? Certainly, the review produced by the businessman, taking all of two months and 33 pages, won’t take much space in his biographies, nor will it rank among Lord Cameron’s high points. The entire thing was a stunt, a cheap headline-grabber with a disastrous choice of frontman, given Sir Philip’s role in the collapse of BHS, hollowing out its pension scheme, and the vote by MPs to strip him of his knighthood.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on South Korea’s martial law debacle: a democratic beacon needs new leadership | Editorial,"President Yoon Suk Yeol’s alarming attempt to impose his will could hardly be worse-timed for a key Asian power The South Korean president’s bizarre, appalling and short-lived attempt to impose martial law last week is still wreaking havoc. Police attempted to raid Yoon&nbsp;Suk&nbsp;Yeol’s office on Wednesday as they investigate him for a potential offence of insurrection. His party says he will hand power to the prime minister and party chief; others call that an unconstitutional “second coup”. It is a measure of the country’s progress since democratisation in the 1980s that the main opposition leader, Lee Jae-myung, initially thought the president’s announcement had been deep-faked, and now describes it as “preposterous”.Mr Yoon claimed without evidence that martial law was necessary to eradicate the threat from “despicable pro-North Korean anti-state forces” – meaning the opposition. Though other conservatives share his bitter conviction that the left are Pyongyang-sympathisers, most people believe the decision primarily reflected his erratic and personalised rule. A political outsider, he made his name as a top anti-corruption prosecutor, but grew angry at scrutiny of his wife’s conduct as well as parliamentary obstruction of his policies. Despite his dismal approval ratings he seems to have thought that the people would back him. Within six hours, he was forced to U-turn.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Readers’ views on plans to sell the Observer | Letters,"Harriet Monkhouse, Alison Chapman and Terry Walton on Guardian Media Group’s proposed sale of the Sunday paper to Tortoise MediaI remember the day the Guardian bought the Observer in 1993. I was so thrilled when I heard the news that I immediately rang my mother so we could share our excitement about the Observer joining the family. The news that Guardian Media Group now wants to flog off the Observer has joined the list of moments when I think: “Well, it’s a good thing my mother didn’t live to see this.” My father died before the two papers were united, but I don’t think he’d be very happy about the latest development either.

The Guardian,What Labour can do to defeat the fantasy politics of populism | Letters,"John Chowcat says voters need a personal stake in democracy, while Stephen Coleman looks at why people turn to the magical thinking of demagogues. Plus letters from Anthony Papadopoulos, Colleen Molloy and Rodney BarkerJonathan Freedland’s stark warning is justified (We cannot afford for Starmer’s government to fail. Because Farage is lying in wait, 6 December). A resurgent narrow nationalism, blaming immigrants for the UK’s squeezed living standards and underfunded public services, could replace Labour in office if Starmer’s growth strategy falters over the next few years. Donald Trump’s protectionism and corporate tax cuts could shortly attract yet more overseas investment to an already strong US economy, further weakening economic recovery here.Labour does need to demonstrate practical improvements that voters will recognise. A closely related deep problem also requires attention. A period of economic pessimism and disillusionment with conventional British politics makes many people feel powerless, unable to control their destinies – a sentiment often manipulated by hard-right nativists promoting social division. To counter this, voters need a personal stake in democracy, through genuine experience of collective debate and&nbsp;real public accountability.

The Guardian,Saudi Arabia’s World Cup: what will the 2034 tournament look like?,"It will be in the winter again and many stadiums and hotels are yet to be built but there is a genuine love for the sportFifa’s bid evaluation report left no doubt: Saudi Arabia had put together the most convincing, highest-scoring package of all time. Staggeringly the fact 11 of the 15 stadiums are yet to be built provided little obstacle; nor did the fact Fifa itself pointed to “associated unknowns or challenges”. Many of the new venues have been designed by the US firm Populous, which also has a headquarters in London. Its work includes Spurs’ home and Lusail Stadium, which hosted the 2022 World Cup final. The visuals are dramatic and the ambition sweeping: King Salman Stadium in Riyadh will hold 92,000, staging the opening game and final. Prince Mohammed bin Salman Stadium, another Riyadh venue, has perhaps been the most widely trailed with its futuristic design and open side that looks out over cliffs. Numerous promises have been made regarding the arenas’ post-tournament legacies and sustainability prospects; hopefully those plans will be effected more quickly than those made for Qatar, where Stadium 974, yet to be dismantled and reconstructed elsewhere as mooted, is one example of a ground running beyond borrowed time.

To say “Dobbo” is not your average coach is self-evident from his CV. In addition to degrees in law and business administration from the University of Cape Town there is surely no other top-level director of rugby with a creative writing degree. As he wryly puts it: “I was the only person on the course who didn’t wear a tweed skirt.”As a player he was also, for two seasons, the only white guy in an otherwise exclusively black working-class club side. “What did I learn? How privileged us white people were.” He was conscripted into the South African army during the apartheid era, has had two novels published and is the son of a noted South African rugby writer, referee and historian. He describes himself as “an accidental coach” having started out as coach of his local university fourth XV, but has subsequently guided the Stormers, then in administration, to the inaugural 2022 URC title, the franchise’s first piece of silverware.

The Guardian,‘To cough was to risk death’: the artist who mapped Syria’s Sednaya prison with testimonies from its survivors,"Warning: this feature contains details of tortureAs an artist and audio investigator, I interviewed people who had been imprisoned in a building where sound and vision were weaponised. So what should happen to this monstrous place now it has been liberated?In 2016, I worked with Forensic Architecture and Amnesty International to lead the acoustic part of the investigation into Sednaya, the Assad regime’s most notorious prison. Since the uprising against the regime began in 2011 until the early hours of Sunday, the prison had been inaccessible to journalists and independent observers. The memories of the few people who have been released were the only resources available to learn about and then document the mass-murder, torture and violation that took place there.In Sednaya, prisoners’ capacity to see anything was highly restricted. From the time detainees were taken from their homes or pulled out of protests and thrown into cells, they were blindfolded. In the cells they were kept in darkness, made to cover their eyes and face the wall in the presence of the guards. Over time, they developed an acute sensitivity to sound. My task, as an artist and audio investigator, was to develop “earwitness” interviews with six survivors of Sednaya, using their sonic memories to help reveal the crimes that took place inside.

Kraven thinks of human beings as the only worthy game (that is: bad people who deserve what’s coming to them) and despises people who presume to kill noble beasts.

Popp, meanwhile, accompanies with melodic drum textures, including interlocking patterns on toms and tuned percussion. Recording almost entirely in single, improvised takes, Enji and Popp produce a remarkably expansive and imaginative sound from just two instruments, sitting somewhere between enveloping ambience and spiritual improvisation.

But she wasn’t quite sure which ones. “The first thing I felt was a kind of shiver,” she recalls in a new documentary. “Was it horror or was it pleasure?” She was intoxicated by the frenzy of neon signs that “reach out and hit you as you travel down the highway”, and exhilarated by the overload of pure “communication without architecture”. Was there something there, she wondered, that architects could learn from?Half a century later, we find her back in Vegas, walking around a graveyard of neon signs in a dusty lot with her husband Robert Venturi. Together the duo changed the course of modern architecture, championing everyday popular taste and the “ugly ordinary” over the rarefied, bleached white world of modernism. They brought back wit, colour and meaning, and embraced messy diversity over the bland homogeneity of so much of the built environment. And Sin City was the cradle of their inspiration – proselytised in their seminal 1972 book, Learning from Las Vegas. Continue reading...","Wed, 11 Dec 2024 14:59:29 GMT",0.0,-0.3336

I was unused to the concept, apart from writing to Santa as a kid. Usually, my family’s norm is to haphazardly guess what each person might want – with a pretty conservative success rate, if I’m being honest. So I was surprised by the tradition of requesting and sharing wishlists – and even more surprised by how much I liked it.I’m the kind of gift-giver who keeps an eye out year-round for what people might enjoy, picking things up in advance and delighting them with my acuity and taste. Nonetheless, I don’t find the perfect gift for everyone every single year like clockwork, because I am not superhuman. Ever since adopting the wishlist tradition into my own family I find having gift ideas direct from the people in my life is unbeatably practical, massively stress-reducing and satisfying.

Everyone knew each other and we were always in and out of each other’s homes.”In the autumn of 1984, one of her neighbours invited her to his family home in New Jersey for Rosh Hashanah, a Jewish new year celebration.

Then came the injury that shattered my dreamsWhen I was 15 I won a scholarship to study at Wells Cathedral school, a specialist music school in Somerset. I had wanted to be a cellist for as long as I could remember. I got up at 5am to play scales, practised at lunchtime and returned to my cello after lessons. I discovered the fireworks of Dvořák, the frenetic drive and nerviness of Shostakovich and the melancholy of Bloch. But above all I fell deeply in love with Elgar’s Cello Concerto.One evening a year later, as I was preparing for a major competition, I pushed myself too far. I was playing a demanding study involving endless trills, working my weaker fourth and fifth fingers too hard, when something felt as if it snapped in my forearm, and I felt a burning pain between my wrist and elbow. When it hadn’t got better after a day or two I started to panic. Days became weeks. I still could not write or play. The school sent me to see specialists, but no one offered a conclusive diagnosis, or any treatment that proved effective. Continue reading...","Wed, 11 Dec 2024 06:55:39 GMT",0.5994,-0.7806

In the US, however, biscuits (cookies) are A Big Deal, and almost a competitive sport. Taking their cue from the Germanic and Scandinavian tradition of plätzchen and lebkuchen, the American holiday cookie platter is, Chicago-based food writer Tim Mazurek explains, “a generous fantasia where butter cookies decorated like angels mingle with rugelach and rum balls. The cookie platter doesn’t care about your religion, or lack of one. It welcomes everyone and promises that you’ll find something you like.”I was completely unaware of this custom until an American-born friend appeared on my doorstep last December bearing a handsomely wrapped package of no fewer than seven varieties of biscuit, so count me a convert, Lord. Less divisive than mince pies and fruitcake, and considerably easier than panettone, biscuits keep and travel well, and are open to all manner of glitzy customisation, making them the ideal edible present. Here I’ve stuck to the simplest sort, the rolled vanilla cookie, but once you’ve mastered that, the world is your glittery gift platter.

The Guardian,I was forced to give my baby away – and it was 40 years before I saw him again,"Abused as a child, barely able to support herself as an adult, Maria Arbuckle was one of thousands of unmarried women who suffered in Ireland’s mother and baby homes. She talks about her long battle to be reunited with her son – and the tragedy that struck soon afterWhen Maria Arbuckle thinks of her time in Ireland’s largest mother and baby home, she thinks of the nursery and its snug rows of cots, each one filled with a tiny, bleating bundle. She thinks of her boy, Paul, among them, and the 8lb 10oz weight of him in her arms. She thinks of how she fed and washed him under the careful watch of the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul. And she thinks of the refrain that ended each visit, when she had to&nbsp;hand him back to them: “He’s not yours any more. He doesn’t belong to you.”Arbuckle, 62, was six months pregnant when she was sent by social services in Northern Ireland to Saint Patrick’s mother and baby home over the border in Dublin. She was 18 and emerging from a childhood spent shunted between a children’s home, an abusive foster home and a church-run industrial school for children considered to be in “moral danger”. It was 1981, Northern Ireland was in the thick of the Troubles and she was living in the border county of Monaghan, far from her native Derry.

The Guardian,‘It’s about total freedom’: Jeff Wall on his photographs of fallen horse riders and flooded graves,"A new exhibition displays 40 years of work by the artist who stages scenes to painstakingly replicate the images in his mind – and some, he says, are definitely easier than othersJeff Wall has long been championed as the master of slow looking. Back in 1985, the year before he turned 40, the British Columbia-born artist received a tip from a close friend. He had, by that point, published landmark scholarly essays, held professorships and made some seminal images, though not that many. His friend had seen a woman fall off her horse, and thought that was something Wall should photograph. “He said: ‘That kind of looked like a subject you could do,’ and I totally disregarded it because I just wasn’t interested at the time. But, two years ago, it came back to me.”Over the past 40 years, Wall has utilised the speed and precision of photography to make exquisite, arresting works based on furtive moments just like this. Ask him how he decides what to shoot and he’ll likely say he’s not sure. Somehow, a vision bubbles up to the surface of his mind. As the viewer, the work he makes in response demands your stillness.
