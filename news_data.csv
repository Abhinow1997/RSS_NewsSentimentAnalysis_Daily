The Guardian,"Ukraine war briefing: Putin aiming to ‘manipulate’ Trump, Zelenskyy warns","Ukrainian president issues warning after Russia’s leader said he was ‘ready for negotiations’ with US counterpart on the war. What we know on day 1,067See all our Ukraine coverage Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has warned that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, is aiming to “manipulate” Donald Trump, after Putin praised the US leader and said he was ready for talks with him. “He wants to manipulate the desire of the president of the United States of America to achieve peace,” Zelenskyy said during his daily evening address on Friday. He said Putin was ready to continue the war and “manipulate the leaders of the world”.Putin has said he is ‘ready for negotiations” on the war in Ukraine with Donald Trump and suggested it would be a good idea for them to meet. The Russian president struck a favourable tone towards his US counterpart, describing his relationship with Trump as “businesslike, pragmatic and trustworthy”. Putin echoed the US president’s claim that he would have prevented the war starting in Ukraine in 2022, and parroted Trump’s debunked assertion that the 2020 US elections were “stolen” from him.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has ordered a halt to virtually all US foreign aid, but made an exception for funding to Israel and Egypt, according to an internal memo to staff at the US state department. The sweeping order appears to affect everything from development assistance to military aid – including potentially to Ukraine, which received billions of dollars in weapons under Donald Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, as it tries to repel a Russian invasion. The scope of the order was not immediately known and it was unclear what funding could be cut given that the US Congress sets the federal government budget.North Korea is preparing to send more soldiers to fight in Ukraine, military officials in South Korea have said, despite reports of heavy casualties among troops from the communist state. South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff said in a statement on Friday that four months after the North sent an estimated 11,000 troops to the Ukraine conflict – a significant number of whom have been killed or wounded – the regime “is suspected of accelerating follow-up measures and preparation for an additional dispatch of troops”.Russian aerial attacks near Kyiv killed three people and wounded several others, Ukrainian officials said on Friday. “Three people were killed in an enemy attack in the Kyiv region,” the emergency services said in a statement on social media. Fragments of a drone had struck a 10-storey residential building after the head of the region said a private home had also been hit, it added.An overnight Ukrainian attack involving more than 121 drones had targeted 13 Russian regions, Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday, but they were repelled. Ukraine’s military said the attack hit a Russian oil refinery and a microchip factory in the Bryansk region with a video posted online showing a giant plume of smoke and flames engulfing an oil refinery in the Ryazan region.Tens of thousands of protesters flocked to a central square in the Slovakian capital Bratislava on Friday, waving banners opposing prime minister Robert Fico’s policy shift closer to Russia. Opposition parties last week said they were initiating a no-confidence vote against Fico’s government, but the prime minister has looked set to survive the vote. The latest round of protests come after Fico privately travelled to Moscow in December to meet Vladimir Putin, a rare encounter for an EU leader since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.Sales of US military equipment to foreign governments in 2024 rose by 29% to a record $318.7bn as countries sought to replenish stocks sent to Ukraine and prepare for major conflicts, the US state department said on Friday. Sales approved in the year included $23bn worth of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey, $18.8bn worth of F-15 fighter jets to Israel and $2.5bn worth of M1A2 Abrams tanks to Romania.

She cowered on the dirt floor as giant boulders flew past the kitchen from the hillside above, sending a rock the size of a small car crashing through the thatched roof of one house, narrowly missing the bed where her grandmother slept. When it was over, the landslide had gouged a huge scar through their property, and Hawel heard the cries: “Mummy, mummy.”She scrambled outside to find her son Samuel, 3, buried up to his chin in rubble. She and her niece Kendra, 8, dug him out; when she clutched him to her, he miraculously had only a few scratches on his back. Continue reading...","Sat, 25 Jan 2025 00:05:05 GMT",-0.3612,-0.8777

What felt fresh and exciting last year has now become slightly rote; something not helped by an intake of contestants who seemed to have been chosen based on their innate annoyingness.One problem is that they all kept saying ‘yourself’ instead of ‘you’, which is a harrowing thing to have to hear over and over again for a month. But the bigger problem is that everyone is wise to the game now. Almost every contestant rocked up to Andross Castle with a honking great sense of self-interested superiority.

The Guardian,Jimpa review – Olivia Colman soars in otherwise muddled queer family drama,"Sundance film festival: Australian director Sophie Hyde’s earnest, semi-autobiographical film moves before it starts to meanderMore so than other film festivals, Sundance can be a kingmaking force, shining light on an unknown film-maker and then entering into a mutually beneficial relationship with them. Directors return, shifted from smaller to larger venues, off-peak to primetime slots, and watching this steady climb can be a gratifying reward.The Australian director Sophie Hyde has earned this more than most. Her first film, 52 Tuesdays, a thoughtful drama about a transitioning parent’s relationship with their daughter, won her the festival’s best director prize before she returned five years later with Animals, a sharp and spiky adaptation of Emma Jane Unsworth’s painfully perceptive novel of a fracturing friendship. She returned three years later with Good Luck to You, Leo Grande, an unusually frank and explicit comedy drama with a standout Emma Thompson (who, along with Animals’ Holliday Grainger deserved far more serious awards attention). In just over a decade, Hyde had established herself as someone whose name had become an instant sign of a certain top-tier Sundance quality, a skilled actors’ director whose films burrowed deeper than most.Jimpa is screening at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution Continue reading...","Fri, 24 Jan 2025 19:01:46 GMT",0.0,0.9899

As for consequences, they are for wimps.Hardly had Trump ended his inaugural rant than Starmer launched another assault on his pet hates, “nimbys” and “blockers”.

We reproduce it in fullO God, you made us in your own image and redeemed us through Jesus your Son: Look with compassion on the whole human family; take away the arrogance and hatred which infect our hearts; break down the walls that separate us; unite us in bonds of love; and work through our struggle and confusion to accomplish your purposes on Earth; that, in your good time, all nations and races may serve you in harmony around your heavenly throne; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.Jesus said, “Everyone then who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock. The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell – and great was its fall!” Now when Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were astounded at his teaching, for he taught them as one having authority, and not as their scribes.Joined by many across the country, we have gathered this morning to pray for unity as a nation – not for agreement, political or otherwise, but for the kind of unity that fosters community across diversity and division, a unity that serves the common good.The Right Rev Mariann Edgar Budde is the Episcopal bishop of Washington Continue reading...","Fri, 24 Jan 2025 11:36:23 GMT",-0.7003,0.9633

The Israel Defense Forces believe he was murdered by Palestinian Islamic Jihad in mid-January.Beyond Chana’s account, we have no further news about my father. Like many other hostage families, we don’t know if he is dead or alive. We may find out this weekend. Hamas is set to release a list on Saturday of who in the first stage of the deal is still alive and who isn’t. We have infinite questions about what our loved ones have endured in more than 470 days of captivity, but may soon face the most binary of answers. We are bracing ourselves. I wish I knew how to prepare for that, knew what was the right thing to do.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Trump’s first days: the overload is intentional | Editorial,"The US president has issued a blizzard of edicts and announcements. Determining where to focus the fightback will be difficult but essential Waiting for Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday was like watching a tsunami gather force. Everyone could see the threat approaching. But its scale was still shocking as it hit land, and what damage it wreaks will ultimately take months and years to determine.The deluge is intentional. For supporters, there is a sense of unleashed macho, almost messianic energy – setting the US on a path to national destiny which might take in Greenland, Panama and ultimately Mars. This time Mr Trump has an electoral mandate, a compliant team with a ready agenda, the obsequiousness of billionaires who command the attention economy, and a compliant supreme court which has already granted the president extraordinary power. He aspires to the rule of a monarch. The flood of executive orders, pardons and pronouncements is intended to overwhelm and intimidate, but also to disorientate&nbsp;opponents.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on The Traitors: television for dark times | Editorial,"The hit show has been compared to cosy crime drama. But it also has parallels with Hilary Mantel’s historical masterpieceDoomy towers, candlelit assignations, whispers in corridors, banishments in the dead of night and a cruel and capricious master – The Traitors has more in common with the prestige historical drama Wolf Hall than you might expect. Based on Hilary Mantel’s Booker prize-winning trilogy following the life of Thomas Cromwell, The Mirror and the Light, its final instalment came to its&nbsp;bloody end in December. In January, the treacherous skies over 16th-century Hampton Court shifted to storm clouds swirling over Ardross Castle in&nbsp;Scotland for the return of the hit reality TV show. Dark times call for dark television.The Traitors might be a spin on the cosy crime formula (strangers in a country house, murder and amateur sleuthing), but the parallels with Mantel’s trilogy are also striking. The English Reformation divided the faithful, after all. In the politics of the Tudor court and The Traitors castle, it’s all about manipulation, power and self-preservation. Everyone is jockeying for&nbsp;favour, watching their backs, backstabbing and trying to fill the coffers for themselves and their cronies. By the final episode, most of the main characters end up with their heads on the block. All of&nbsp;which makes Claudia Winkleman Henry VIII, but&nbsp;with better hair and knitwear.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,We show we’re human when we put pen to paper | Letters,"Students of literature in future will have far less to go on if handwriting becomes obsolete, writes Dr Claire Nicholson. Plus letters from Michael Daley, Alan Sekers, Alan Gough, Dr Emile de Sousa and Marie PatersonThe loss of handwriting skills has far-reaching implications beyond the ability to guide a pen across paper (Signature moves: are we losing the ability to write by hand?, 21 January). I have been privileged to introduce students to the manuscript of Virginia Woolf’s essay Women and Fiction, which was later revised and expanded to become the celebrated text A Room of One’s Own. The impact of seeing her hastily scrawled words in purple ink with crossings-out as she sought the perfect word is a joy to witness and something that will never be matched by the typewritten word. What will a literary archive look like to the students of the future, if it only exists as typed words on a screen? I doubt it could ever reach the same level of excitement.Dr Claire NicholsonChair, Virginia Woolf Society of Great Britain• The disappearance of handwriting is alarming for all the reasons given by Christine Rosen – but while hand-forming letters certainly increases cognitive skills, so too can tracing them. An elderly art school colleague once explained how he’d been trained to draw capital Roman letters as a student at the then South Kensington art school (later the Royal College of Art). Students had been required to trace a large sample Roman capital letter on arrival every morning – until they no longer needed to do so, having internalised all its properties, at which point daily tracings of the next letter began. Every student left the school able to draw Roman letters freehand. It would seem that even a thing drawn, even “mechanically”, is a thing better remembered and understood.

And yet Amorim’s current troubles are simply a magnified version of his first steps into coaching at Casa Pia, the Portuguese third-tier team he took charge of aged 33.Amorim’s future was in doubt, his tactics were questioned, he was losing games: it all seems familiar. And yet he survived, which is not to say this is how it will end at United. In this chapter of his career, a portrait of a remarkable young coach with unusual empathy does emerge. Marcus Rashford might raise an arched eyebrow at that but perhaps he should stick around to discover the real Ruben. Amorim is likely to be a force in European coaching as long as the horror show of United’s chaotic ownership doesn’t drag him into a vortex of failure.

The World Cup is a wonderful tournament but there is debate over how many teams should feature, the Champions Cup has been tinkered with in terms of format and the Premiership has undergone changes, whether it be the number of teams or the absence of promotion and relegation. Against that backdrop, having a tournament as consistently familiar as the Six Nations is special.Whether you’re a supporter, an administrator, a player or a broadcaster, we all believe that the Six Nations is the shining light of rugby.

The Guardian,Marilyn Manson won’t face charges after investigation into sexual assault claims,"Los Angeles county district attorney says allegations are too old and evidence insufficient to charge musicianProsecutors said on Friday that they will not file charges against Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation of allegations of sexual assault and domestic violence.
 The Los Angeles county district attorney, Nathan Hochman, said the allegations were too old under the law and the evidence was not sufficient to charge the 56-year-old shock rocker whose legal name is Brian Warner.
 “We have determined that allegations of domestic violence fall outside of the statute of limitations, and we cannot prove charges of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt,” Hochman said. “We recognize and applaud the courage and resilience of the women who came forward to make reports and share their experiences, and we thank them for their cooperation and patience with the investigation.”
 Nearly four years after the investigation began, the then district attorney, George Gascón, said on 9 October that his office was pursuing new leads that added to the “already extensive” file that authorities had amassed.
 LA county sheriff’s detectives said early in 2021 that they were investigating Manson for incidents between 2009 and 2011 in West Hollywood, where Manson lived at the time. The investigation included a search warrant that was served on his West Hollywood home. The case was initially turned over to prosecutors in September 2021, but the Los Angeles county district attorney’s office requested more evidence-gathering and the investigation resumed.
 The identities of the women police and prosecutors spoke to were not revealed, but the Game of Thrones actor Esmé Bianco – who sued Manson in a case that has been settled – said she was part of the criminal investigation. Before the decision not to prosecute, she criticized how long the process was taking at a rally for Hochman, who was elected soon after.
 “Almost four years ago, I did what victims of rape are supposed to do: I went to the police,” she said on 10 October. “I described to them in agonizing detail how the rock musician Brian Warner – better known by his stage name Marilyn Manson – had raped and abused me over the course of our relationship.”
 Bianco said she gave investigators “hundreds of pieces of evidence, including photos of my body covered in bites, bruises and knife wounds, emails and text messages, threats to my immigration status”.
 In her lawsuit, Bianco alleged sexual, physical and emotional abuse, and said that Manson violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England for non-existent roles in music videos and movies.
 Manson’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He has previously called the allegations “provably false”. A representative for Bianco did not immediately return a message seeking comment.
 In 2021 his former fiancee, the Westworld actor Evan Rachel Wood, named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post.
 Wood and Manson’s relationship became public in 2007 when he was 38 and she was 19, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.
 “He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,” Wood said.
 Manson replied on Instagram that these were “horrible distortions of reality”. He sued Wood, saying she and another woman fabricated accusations against him and convinced others to do the same. A judge threw out significant sections of the suit, then in November, Manson agreed to drop it and pay Wood’s attorney fees.
 The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused, unless they come forward publicly as Bianco and Wood have done.

Spare, elegiac, quiet but affecting, this John Magaro-led character study is, fittingly, filmed and mostly set in the festival’s home state (for now) of Utah. It’s a tense family drama that mostly keeps its cards close to the chest and an ode, at least visually, to the liminal, fragile states one can enter on the road in the American west.The bedsheets are still warm and the dawn light still pale when Ella, played by remarkable newcomer Molly Belle Wright, and her younger brother Charlie (a charming Wyatt Solis) pile into the car at the behest of their tight-lipped father (Magaro). He refuses to say where they’re going beyond a “trip”, but from the way Magaro hunches his shoulders and shifts his gaze, you can assume it’s not for pleasure.Omaha is screening at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution Continue reading...","Sat, 25 Jan 2025 00:10:11 GMT",0.0,0.9672

Now I’m meeting him for the first time in the flesh, ahead of the book’s appearance in paperback, and we’re talking about yet another crisis.“Have you seen the news?” is the first thing he asks, presenting it like a challenge even before he says “hello”. I rack my brain distressingly slowly, like a librarian using a card index for the very first time, thinking: which bit of the news? LA is on fire; Gaza is on fire; Ukraine is on fire; a bunch of Teslas are on fire. Seriously, we’ve all seen a lot of news. Continue reading...","Fri, 24 Jan 2025 05:00:04 GMT",0.5994,-0.9528
The Guardian,‘A constant state of panic’: how war in Gaza triggered new wave of depression and insomnia among Palestinian refugees from 1967 war,"The stress of seeing the destruction of their homeland sent rates of mental illness soaring in Jordan’s Jerash camp – and the ceasefire has brought scant reliefPhotographs by Alaa AtwahAmong the hills of northern Jordan, three miles west of the Roman ruins of Jerash, a sprawling settlement is home to more than 40,000 Palestinian people. Set up as an emergency shelter to accommodate 11,500 Palestinians forcibly displaced from Gaza during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, Jerash camp – known locally as Gaza camp – was intended as a temporary solution.The initial clusters of tents have since evolved into a more permanent settlement, where generations of refugees have grown up. Jordan hosts the largest number of Palestinian refugees in the world and most of the 2.3 million living there have been granted citizenship.

The Guardian,Southport attacks: the failures that allowed Axel Rudakubana to kill – podcast,"The murders of three little girls in the seaside town led to horror – and then racist riots. Now the teenaged killer has been sentenced to 52 years. Josh Halliday reportsIt was hard to imagine a more unlikely place for horror to unfold than a community centre holding a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in the sleepy seaside town of Southport. So when three little girls were murdered and eight other children and two adults viciously stabbed by a 17-year-old boy, it seemed incomprehensible. But before the shock could wear off, misinformation and lies about who had unleashed this misery began to spread. The result was days of racist riots and violence.Josh Halliday, the Guardian’s North of England editor, covered the attacks, the riots and now the court case of Axel Rudakubana as he was sentenced to 52 years in prison. On Monday, as the jury was expected to be sworn in, the now 18-year-old Rudakubana shocked everyone by pleading guilty to all the charges he was faced with. And this week the judge gave him a life sentence. Continue reading...","Fri, 24 Jan 2025 03:00:44 GMT",-0.891,-0.9968
