The Guardian,Who are the main actors in the fall of the regime in Syria?,"Rebel alliance includes groups with roots in Islamic extremism, Arab and Turkmen fighters, and Kurdish and Druze coalitionsSyria live – latest updatesHayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS; Levant Liberation Union) is led by Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, and is the dominant faction in the rebel alliance which toppled the regime of Bashar al-Assad with a lightning offensive launched late last month from its stronghold in the north-west. The group has its origins in al-Qaida and Islamic State, and was formally founded in 2017 after breaking with both. HTS has since governed 2 million people in Idlib province, and evolved a more pragmatic ideology, many analysts say. Concerns remain about its extremist roots and the presence of veteran jihadist fighters among its forces.The Syrian National Army (SNA) is a coalition based in northern Syria backed by Ankara. It was founded in 2017 and includes a diverse range of Arab and Turkmen groups and fighters, including some veterans from the very earliest days of the rebellion against the Assad regime. The SNA participated in the campaign against IS, but has also intensively battled the Kurdish forces in Syria. In recent days, the SNA has launched an offensive against Kurdish groups and has made gains around Manbij, a strategic northern town. Turkey wants to prevent Kurdish groups establishing a solid, contiguous presence on the Syrian side of its southern border and stabilise the zone to allow the return of refugees.

The Guardian,Will emergence of HTS in Syria raise level of global terrorism threats?,"Intelligence chiefs have to decisively analyse the risk posed by group once affiliated to islamists al-QaidaWhen Sir Richard Moore, the head of MI6, warned in a speech given 10 days ago that he had “never seen the world in a more dangerous state” Syria was mentioned just once. The context was that jihadist terrorism was on the retreat in the country, but after the lightning success of the rebel offensive, questions will inevitably be asked again.Intelligence chiefs are now having to quickly reassess the triumphant Syrian rebels, and in particular, the leading group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), now designated as a terror organisation by the US and the UK. Once a Syrian offshoot of al-Qaida, HTS cut its affiliation in 2016 and under the leadership of Abu Mohammed al-Jolani the group has sought to project a moderate image as it has led the counter offensive from Idlib to Damascus. In an interview with CNN, al-Jolani said he would respect Syrian minorities and “no one has the right to erase another group”. Early reports from Aleppo suggest the Christian minority in Aleppo was unaffected after the HTS capture of the city a week ago. Continue reading...","Mon, 09 Dec 2024 18:52:10 GMT",-0.8126,-0.6424
The Guardian,"Ukraine war briefing: Our war dead 43,000 and Russia’s 198,000 says Zelenskyy","Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggests foreign troops to protect Ukraine until it can join Nato; Ukraine’s president woos potential next German chancellor. What we know on day 1,021 Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday that 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the war, while of 370,000 injured, about half had been able to return to service after treatment. The Ukrainian president said 198,000 Russian soldiers had been killed and a further 550,000 injured. Almost 800,000 Russian troops are deployed in Ukraine, he said. The figures were not independently verified.Zelenskyy on Monday made the case for a diplomatic settlement to end Russia’s war in Ukraine and raised the idea of foreign troops being deployed in his country until it could join the Nato military alliance. It came after Donald Trump said Kyiv was ready to make a deal with Moscow to stop the war and that Vladimir Putin should make efforts toward negotiating a truce. The Ukrainian president told reporters he was hoping to call the outgoing US president, Joe Biden, in the coming days to discuss Nato membership.“A troop contingent from one country or another could be present in Ukraine for as long as it isn’t part of Nato. But for that we need to have a clear understanding of when Ukraine becomes an EU member and when a Nato member,” Zelenskyy said. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, caused controversy in Europe in February when he raised the possibility of European nations sending troops to Ukraine. “Even if we get invited [to Nato], what happens then? Who guarantees our security? We can think about that and work on Emmanuel Macron’s proposal,” Zelenskyy said.Zelenskyy asked for more support from Berlin against Russia while meeting with the current German opposition CDU party leader, Friedrich Merz, who is leading opinion polls ahead of elections in February. “We are counting on stronger, more decisive actions from Germany, from you personally. We are counting on it very much,” Zelenskyy said, mentioning Ukraine’s request for an invitation to join Nato and for long-range missiles. Merz has urged the current chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to send Ukraine the long-range Taurus missile system, which could fire deep into Russian territory – something Scholz has refused to do.The Estonian prime minister, Kristen Michal, was also in Kyiv on Monday to meet with Zelenskyy and other senior officials, including Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal.Ukrainian officials said Russian attacks killed a 91-year-old woman in the village of Stara Mykolayivka in the Donetsk region on Monday, as shelling also wounded four others. A man was killed in the southern Kherson region, said the local governor, Oleksandr Prokudin.Ukraine will soon get another €4.2bn after the EU’s member states approved the planned payment, the EU council announced. The money is intended to help Ukraine’s struggling economy. Continue reading...","Tue, 10 Dec 2024 00:29:18 GMT",-0.9201,-0.8216

The Guardian,Somebody Somewhere season three review – remarkable TV that burrows into your heart,"Bridget Everett’s gorgeous comedy bows out as it began: as a beautiful look at family, found family and, above all, friendship. If only HBO hadn’t cancelled it …For anyone from a tight-knit small town who has moved away, the “what if I never left” question may be one that lingers in the mind. This is the story that fuels Somebody Somewhere, which stars the New York cabaret legend Bridget Everett as Sam, who moves back to Manhattan, Kansas, to nurse her sister as she dies of cancer, and ends up settling down, if you can call it that, in the town where she was born and raised. There has always been a sense that this show was fighting against the odds. It is a subtle and gentle tale in a TV landscape that rewards big bangs, and it is one of those beautiful, sad comedies that elicit the occasional belly laugh, but mostly leave behind a low-level hum of melancholy. This summer, HBO announced that this third season will be its last.Somebody Somewhere bows out as it came in, exploring the push and pull between loneliness and human connection. Sam is finally getting on with her surviving sister, Tricia (a fabulous Mary Catherine Garrison), now that Tricia’s divorce from Rick has come through. Tricia’s commercial empire, built on embroidering one particularly rude word on soft furnishings and homeware, is going great guns and has given her financial stability and a massive car. For Tricia, life as a single woman, whose daughter has left home, brings its own challenges. A related scene between Sam and Tricia, in a hotel bathroom in Kansas City, is one of the show’s rare and deserved belly-laugh moments.

She never stops smiling, as any parent who has seen her CBeebies show Maddie’s Do You Know? will attest. On TV (and YouTube) she breezily explains how things work, zooming in with closeup cameras. And that’s much of what happens in this special Christmas live show, where the set-up is that Maddie is doing work experience at Santa’s workshop, and with the help of two elves, and the audience, has to solve some urgent problems in time for Mrs Claus’s Christmas party: what makes crackers go bang? Why do Brussels sprouts make us fart?Moate is the kind of person who makes even chat about poos and farts edifying. It’s all extremely wholesome. A theatre full of children singing along to a song about how great science is. “Sci-ence, sci-ence / Making sense with evi-dence” it goes. “She’s very energetic,” says my seven-year-old, who thinks he’s far too grown up for CBeebies but grinned throughout this well put-together, entertaining hour. It covers electrical circuits and the water cycle with Stem-friendly raps and japes, as Moate brings all her festive cheer and best-ever-primary-school-teacher energy to proceedings.At Apollo theatre, London, until 4 January Continue reading...","Mon, 09 Dec 2024 15:46:50 GMT",0.3804,0.986

Trump won’t be happy• Golden Globes 2025: Emilia Pérez scores 10 nominations as Kate Winslet, Selena Gomez and Sebastian Stan each take two• Full list of 2025 nominationsThe Golden Globes nomination list once again raises the curtain for awards season in this new, uncertain era for the movies: post-strike, post-pandemic, but very much pre-AI. Of course, the Globes cover TV as well, and may well in years to come find themselves in a new era of relevance as so many, rightly or wrongly, claim the distinction between the two is blurring. It is certainly supposed to be a new era of respectability for the Globes, which (it hopes) has put to bed accusations of non-diversity and kickbacks. It’s hoping also that this year’s presenter Nikki Glaser will do better than last year’s icily received turn from Jo Koy.It’s a great Globes list for streamer Netflix, hip distributor A24 and indeed the Cannes film festival, whose films are well represented. But awards lists will always annoy someone and this year that someone is going to be President-elect Trump, who will no doubt be infuriated at the best actor (drama) nomination for Sebastian Stan, who plays young Trump in the early-years biopic The Apprentice. Trump hates it, although I thought the movie went pretty easy on him. Jeremy Strong picks up a best supporting actor nomination for playing Trump’s toxic mentor Roy Cohn.

The Guardian,‘Some see religion – others porn’: Louise Giovanelli on the paintings that made Manchester hot,"Warned she would never get collectors to the ‘grim north’, the artist is now at the forefront of a booming scene. She discusses celebrity worship, her working-class art school – and why she’s obsessed with curtainsThere is no other person in sight when I show up at the Maple industrial estate in Ardwick, Manchester. The sprawling, red-bricked complex has the air of an army barracks or an airport hangar. Doors are shuttered, the grass is overgrown, and discarded car parts line the perimeter. It’s also freezing. “Everyone struggles with directions to get here,” says Louise Giovanelli, when she eventually finds me walking in circles outside. The British artist is dressed in black jeans and a black hoodie flecked with paint. As I follow her through a network of tunnels, I feel like we’re about to attend a secret partisan meeting, rather than enter her studio.But there is a cause being championed here today: the north – and, more specifically, Manchester. The 31-year-old, one of the most talked-about artists of her generation, is at the forefront of a new movement of painters who refuse to bow to industry pressure and relocate to London. A number of them – recently dubbed the “Ardwick Realists” – work together out of this same estate. Continue reading...","Mon, 09 Dec 2024 16:00:16 GMT",0.0,-0.6597
The Guardian,The Christmas Thing review – Krampus comes to town as cult comedy is retuned for yuletide,"Seven Dials Playhouse, LondonTom Clarkson and Owen Visser’s anarchic evening has some bright ideas but may be more fun for those taking part than onlookers‘A festive TV show live onstage,” promise multimedia double act Mr Thing, and they’re qualified to deliver it: anarchic floorshows, performed as if for telly, have been Tom Clarkson and Owen Visser’s metier since establishing their fringe act eight years ago. Key to its cult status in Edinburgh, one suspects, is a late-night slot and a steady stream of comedian guests. Without either, this Christmas version, while never stinting on the anarchy and bright ideas, feels a bit more exposed.That may strike you less if you’re one of those audience members (there are a lot of them about these days) for whom the spotlights are as comfy as the stalls. A half of the two-hour running time is taken up by audience participation, MC’d by try-hard Clarkson, as punters take to the stage to showcase random skills, perform the sound effects to an on-screen movie, or play leading man in a series of green-screen adventures. In fairness, I saw the show in a small crowd, which makes participation ickier and the kind of raucous Noel’s House Party jollity Mr Thing seek to invoke, in their primary-coloured suits, more of an effort.At Seven Dials Playhouse, London, until 21 December Continue reading...","Mon, 09 Dec 2024 22:00:23 GMT",0.3612,0.9838
The Guardian,"Cheese, nibbles and wine: the best Christmas hampers – tasted and tested by Felicity Cloake","From a festive vegan offering to one containing a hefty Christmas ham, these are our food writer’s picks of this year’s finest hampersFestive hampers tend, like many things about Christmas, to be more exciting to receive (there’s always a faintly decadent Brideshead Revisited vibe about such wicker-clad bounty) than to consume (So. Much. Chutney!). For obvious practical reasons, many companies focus on preserves and packets of tea which, grateful as you are for the thought, may not be things you’d have chosen to line the back of the cupboard for years to come.However, the carefully chosen selection below – which, having spent a day tasting my way through, I can personally vouch for – is near guaranteed to bring genuine cheer from delivery to dispatch. Instead of the usual boring biscuits and tedious teabags, there’s stuff you actually want to consume over the holiday, from cheese to champagne. Because the spirit of Christmas is all well and good, but if you’re going to spend your hard-earned money, you want more than the thought to count.The feelgood one:Ukrainian Christmas hamper£174.99 at Experience UkraineThe vegan one:The Yuletide vegan hamper£165 at Fortnum &amp; MasonThe cheesy one:Christmas cheeseboard£55 at Highland Fine CheesesThe traditional one:Ham and chutney pig board£94.95 at Emmett’sThe cosy one:Christmas in a Box£30 at Ginger BakersThe fancy one:The Darcy£260 at Thackray Brown Continue reading...","Mon, 09 Dec 2024 16:00:16 GMT",0.6369,0.9342
The Guardian,They ‘didn’t look the type’: how the media was fooled by Bashar and Asma al-Assad | Zoe Williams,"Some journalists underestimated the threat of the brutal president, while his first lady was glamorised in a Vogue featureAs Bashar al-Assad is ousted as Syria’s brutal president, his wife Asma and children having fled to Russia shortly before, the scenes are too astonishing to settle. We can’t call it a finished revolution, but we can call Assad’s a finished regime and mark the end of the Syrian civil war: 13 years of heinous bloodshed; 580,000 people killed – more than 230,000 of them civilians, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, which attributes about 90% of those non-combatant deaths to Assad’s forces.He never looked the type, foreign correspondents say. Adrian Blomfield in the Telegraph calls Assad “awkward and gangly, his mannerisms unassuming”. John Simpson found him “meek and anxious to please”. And who could forget how un-bloodthirsty, how incongruous, Asma al-Assad looked? Neat and understated, like a wife in a miniseries.

In the evening, about 9:30pm UK time (30 minutes after midnight in Homs), I spotted the first video indicating that my home city was finally free from Bashar al-Assad and his forces. Then a friend shared a link of a man livestreaming from the New Clock Tower Square in Homs. I heard the zaghroutas of women; the chants of men: “There is no for ever. There is no for ever. Long live Syria and down with Assad.” People started gathering in the square, bringing the memory of the early days of the revolution in 2011, when the people of Homs were inspired by their brothers and sisters in Tahrir Square in Cairo, Egypt, but innocent civilians were massacred by the Syrian regime.Now 2011 and 2024 were meeting each other. Two dates that have left in between them mass destruction of cities, and the displacement of more than half of the Syrian population from their homes.

The Guardian,Labour’s ‘planning laws reform’ is really an attack on local democracy | Simon Jenkins,"People should have a say in their surroundings. But in its bid to build 1.5m homes, the government has left them powerlessAll proper democracies have two tiers, central and local. They are equally vital, but in Britain the second tier is all but dead. Local democracy has been crippled by Whitehall since Margaret Thatcher’s rate-capping in the 1980s and councils became cash-strapped agencies of central government. There are now fewer councillors in Britain than there are local councils in France.This week the Labour government has laid out its plan to remove the last real discretion local people have enjoyed: the freedom to order the environs of where they and their families live. Participation in planning is to be stifled following a sustained barrage of abuse from Keir Starmer and his housing minister, Angela Rayner. They have dismissed people exercising their democratic rights as nimbys, reactionaries, blockers, bureaucrats, declinists and newt-lovers.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Mon, 09 Dec 2024 16:18:04 GMT",-0.5233,-0.4215

The list is long, and perhaps we would be less concerned if we were all confident that one ailing business would be replaced with another, more dynamic one. But for many of our high streets, that is not the case.Against that gloomy backdrop, a report published at the end of November by the House of Lords’ built environment committee makes for refreshing reading, opening with evidence of “an optimistic and flourishing future” for our high streets.Holly Lewis is a co-founding partner at the research, urbanism and architecture practice We Made That, and town architect for the London Borough of Hackney Continue reading...","Mon, 09 Dec 2024 10:00:19 GMT",0.5267,0.7224

The Sports Direct maestro wants a seat on the Boohoo board for him and a mate, to go with the 27% shareholding his Frasers Group holds in the struggling online retailer. The vote is on 20 December and, naturally, is being preceded by an entertaining round of back-and-forth insults.This is a scrap one wishes it was possible for both sides to lose. Boohoo, with a share price down 90% in five years, certainly deserves a shake-up that a boardroom bruiser in the Ashley style might deliver. The environment for online clothing pioneers has been turned upside down by the arrival of Shein and others, but Boohoo has added mistakes all of its own.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on the courts in crisis: long waits are a route to injustice | Editorial,"Delayed trials don’t get enough attention. But they are harmful both to individuals and societyJustice isn’t working. The fact that most people do not&nbsp;regularly interact with the courts in England and Wales means that the long waiting lists and staff shortages described in our Courts in Crisis series do not attract the same level of attention as delays in the health service. But with the crown court backlog of cases predicted to hit 100,000, the population of remand prisoners at a record high of 17,000, and trials routinely scheduled for years ahead, victims of crime are being failed every day.For some victims and witnesses, long waits become intolerable and they simply give up. As we reported on Friday, the number of rape victims pulling out of prosecutions part-way through has more than doubled in five years. When women have been courageous enough to seek justice it is appalling to see so many fail to secure it, while perpetrators of sexual offences get away with them. Sir Keir Starmer’s government has committed to halve violence against women and girls in a decade. Our analysis undermines the credibility of this and other pledges. Police and the courts are not the only way of tackling crime. But along with prevention and other measures, timely prosecution of violent offenders is essential.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In Romania, sadly, it is now destined to be remembered as a year in which democracy was derailed rather than celebrated.The unprecedented move by the country’s constitutional court last week to annul the results of the first round of the presidential election, amid allegations of Russian interference, is a landmark moment in the increasingly embattled arena of eastern European politics. The decision followed an astonishing surge to first place by a far-right admirer of Vladimir Putin, who had been polling in low single digits until the eve of the election. According to declassified intelligence reports, Călin Georgescu benefited from a vote that was manipulated by various illicit means, including cyber-attacks and a Russian-funded TikTok campaign. Analysts found that about 25,000 pro-Georgescu TikTok accounts became active only two weeks before the first-round vote.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Soucek and Bowen stave off Wolves on emotional night for West Ham,"Wolves could not convince Julen Lopetegui to stay at Molineux last year but they have kept him in his current job. Woeful defending from set pieces cost Gary O’Neil’s side again and, while West Ham hardly played with much style, they can continue to defer making a call on Lopetegui’s future after seeing off wasteful opponents thanks to opportunistic goals from Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen.Ultimately the sense persists that West Ham are delaying the inevitable given that defeat here would have brought an end to their unpopular manager’s unhappy reign. They are in an odd place – nine points above the bottom three, seven off fifth place – and the overall vibe is unconvincing. This performance did little to energise the home crowd and, although it was important to win for Michail Antonio, who is recovering after his horrific car crash, West Ham would be kidding themselves to think a draw would have flattered Wolves.

The Guardian,F1 2024 awards: Max Verstappen joins the greats after hardest-won title,"The Red Bull driver overcame an ‘undriveable monster', McLaren delivered and Lewis Hamilton ended win droughtWith a fourth consecutive world championship, Max Verstappen deserves to be recognised as one of the greats, a place he has earned not least with this year’s title, his most hard-fought yet. After opening in a dominant Red Bull, he executed clinically to take four of the opening five races, keeping his head even as the controversy surrounding the team principal, Christian Horner, consumed Red Bull. However, McLaren’s upgrades at Miami launched a fightback from Lando Norris and after the Spanish GP with the McLaren a quicker ride, Verstappen had to buckle down and make the best of an unbalanced car that he described as an “undriveable monster”. He did so with the commitment and determination of an Alain Prost or Michael Schumacher. Repeatedly grinding out decent points between Spain and Brazil was vital and ultimately enough to ensure he closed it out, a champion’s performance. It was, however, one marked by an aggressive, uncompromising attitude on track that did him a disservice and for which he was penalised. That side of his character was not enhanced by his ill-tempered late-season spat with George Russell, nor the absurd dive he made on Oscar Piastri at the season finale in Abu Dhabi that meant nothing to him but could have affected McLaren’s championship challenge.

The Guardian,Five key takeaways for England after their series success in New Zealand,"Brydon Carse’s ban has been the making of him, while Shoaib Bashir still represents an Ashes gambleUnless you’re Australia, New Zealand is not an easy place to win a Test series. India haven’t done so since 2008-09; England hadn’t managed it since 2007-08. The relatively modest praise for England’s achievement suggests New Zealand are condescended to in defeat as well as victory. If the first Test was a flawed slugfest, the second was a clinical demolition. England put a good New Zealand team under so much pressure – listen to how often the captain, Tom Latham, used that phrase – that eventually they could take no more. In both games England perceived an early batting collapse as an invitation to go harder, a common occurrence in the first Bazball summer and a sign, when it comes off, of a team in rude health. It was also telling that, for the first time in a while, England’s players looked like they were having all kinds of fun. Continue reading...","Mon, 09 Dec 2024 18:00:19 GMT",0.5719,-0.7955

The Guardian,Weather tracker: US winter in full swing after waves of lake-effect snow,"More heavy snow forecast for north-east this week, while South Africa endures third heatwave of summerWinter is well under way in North America with two distinct lake-effect snow events taking place since Thanksgiving. Lake-effect snow is common across the Great Lakes region, and happens when cold air originating from Canada passes over the relatively warm waters of the lakes, causing the layer of air near to the surface to absorb heat and moisture. Warmer than the air above it, this layer of air then starts to rise, cooling and condensing into clouds which deposit snow on the windward side of the lakes.In this particular event, an area of low pressure centred across eastern Canada dragged very cold Arctic air in from the north and plunged it into the north-east of the US. The dry, arctic air blew in from the north-west across the relatively warmer Lake Erie through Thanksgiving, picked up moisture and deposited snow across areas to the south and east of the lake. A dominant band of snow brought rates of 2.5cm to 7.6cm (1in to 3in) an hour to the Erie and Crawford counties. Within the first 12 hours, approximately 30cm of snow fell in Ashtabula County, Ohio, and by Saturday morning, there were reports of more than 90cm of snow in the far north-east of Ohio and north-west of Pennsylvania. As a result of this heavy snowfall, parts of the Interstate 86 and 90 were shut on Friday 29 November. Continue reading...","Mon, 09 Dec 2024 12:17:28 GMT",0.0,0.6597

For some reason it seems to be billing its new film Mary as a Christmas film, when it doesn’t appear to be anything of the sort.We all know what elements a film needs to have to be considered festive. A big-city career girl. A plaid-wearing apple farmer. A local school that needs to be saved. Maybe a naked snowman who comes to life to teach a hot widow how to love again. Almost certainly Lindsay Lohan. And yet Mary has none of these. It’s all deserts and angels and babies being born in mangers and king Herod. It really isn’t very Christmassy at all.

The Guardian,A Nonsense Christmas With Sabrina Carpenter review – an exceptionally good gift,"She promises us the ‘ho-ho-ho-iest’ hour of all … and she delivers! The gloriously droll star brings the festive special bang up to dateThe last time I was this entertained by a Christmas special was in lockdown, when Mariah Carey waved, regally, from a sleigh, for what I remember being about seven hours. But that was four years ago and there hasn’t been a decent one since. So Santa hats off to Sabrina Carpenter for coming up with a holiday special that feels entirely of the moment, right down to its starry duets, carefully curated off-the-cuff moments and internet-baiting comedy skits. Netflix has given her an unlimited budget, she says drolly, as long as she goes viral.What Carpenter has pulled together in A Nonsense Christmas is a buzzy blend of comedy sketches in the style of Saturday Night Live and duets with other pop stars who are similarly hot to go. While every production is a miracle of teamwork, the behind-the-scenes interludes suggest Carpenter has had more input than simply being moved around like a marionette. The comedy is fine, the duets are fun, but it is the Carpenter charisma that keeps it all flowing nicely. Fans will have a field day with clips of her as a toddler, asking for cake instead of Christmas presents, or gags about skimpy costumes, although newcomers may need a primer on a running joke about the ad-libbing at the end of her 2022 hit Nonsense.

The Guardian,Domestic issues pile pressure on Iran’s president amid foreign policy setbacks,"Tensions over executions and plans for petrol price rise and hijab law add to reversals in Gaza, Lebanon and SyriaThe fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, the latest in a string of foreign policy reversals for Iran including the weakening of its allies in Lebanon and Gaza, has coincided with growing domestic frustration over rising executions, planned increases in the price of petrol and a proposed law that imposes heavy fines and loss of access to public services to any woman not wearing the hijab.The confluence of events is putting unprecedented pressure on Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, to demonstrate what reforms he has introduced since being elected in June. He is viewed domestically as a consensual figure and faces a conservative parliament, but his supporters are impatient for changes that will lift the economy.

But at some point in the coming months, the incoming US administration will likely attempt to negotiate an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine.Donald Trump takes office in January and with his self-image as a great dealmaker boasted on the campaign trail that he could end the war in 24 hours. Last week, Trump appointed the retired army general Keith Kellogg as his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, tasked primarily with ending the war.

The Guardian,‘It’s about total freedom’: Jeff Wall on his photographs of fallen horse riders and flooded graves,"A new exhibition displays 40 years of work by the artist who stages scenes to painstakingly replicate the images in his mind – and some, he says, are definitely easier than othersJeff Wall has long been championed as the master of slow looking. Back in 1985, the year before he turned 40, the British Columbia-born artist received a tip from a close friend. He had, by that point, published landmark scholarly essays, held professorships and made some seminal images, though not that many. His friend had seen a woman fall off her horse, and thought that was something Wall should photograph. “He said: ‘That kind of looked like a subject you could do,’ and I totally disregarded it because I just wasn’t interested at the time. But, two years ago, it came back to me.”Over the past 40 years, Wall has utilised the speed and precision of photography to make exquisite, arresting works based on furtive moments just like this. Ask him how he decides what to shoot and he’ll likely say he’s not sure. Somehow, a vision bubbles up to the surface of his mind. As the viewer, the work he makes in response demands your stillness.
