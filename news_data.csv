During these calls, his mother would sometimes repeat herself, asking the same question just minutes later. “We didn’t think much of it, we assumed it was due to technical problems.” Then his father mentioned that there was something wrong with her memory. “Mum being only 63, I didn’t believe him.” But two years later, during a Christmas break abroad, when his mother went upstairs to use the toilet and couldn’t find her way back down, they knew there was something up.Shirley was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease at the age of 67 by a GP using a cognitive test that includes drawing a clock with a certain time on a piece of paper. She received the diagnosis via a letter that consisted of only one line. “I look at that letter and I am appalled by it,” says Chris. “My mother never saw a neurologist. It was such a thin diagnosis.

The Guardian,‘It feels like a vindication’: Andrea Dworkin’s widower on the radical feminist’s rediscovery,"John Stoltenberg, Dworkin’s partner for three decades, is thrilled by the reissue of three of her books as Penguin Modern Classics, and how a new generation is finding inspiration from her workThough it’s now two decades since Andrea Dworkin died, her widower John Stoltenberg still finds it difficult to talk about her. “I sometimes break down,” he warns me, his mellow voice bumpy for just a moment. In a way, of course, she’s all around. He has stayed on in the Washington DC condominium where she died (he lives there with his husband of 15 years, Joe Hamilton); her books and music – she loved country – are a constant reminder of the life they shared. But her absence is deeply felt nonetheless. “It was a huge loss. Sometimes, I turn to her work just to hear her voice again. I connect to the way her mind was working, and I kind of invent a conversation with her.” In truth, it’s a blessing that she was a writer. In 2005, at the mortuary to discuss her cremation, he heard the horrible word “cremains” for the first time. “In that moment, I had the insight that Andrea’s remains would really be her words. They live on as she doesn’t.”At first, admittedly, those words continued to be read only by a select few. At the best of times, Dworkin was a polarising figure, her uncompromising feminism despised by right and left alike (the right insisted she was a man-hater who believed all sex was rape; on the left, sex-positive feminists loathed her crusade against pornography). But slowly, this changed. “She joined several zones of conversation,” as Stoltenberg puts it. First, the scholars started working on her, devoting chapter after chapter to Dworkin in their academic books. Then, a new generation of feminists began rediscovering her. “I’ve subscribed to a service that tracks mention of Andrea, and I really shouldn’t spend so much time with it, because it giveth and it taketh away,” he says. “I mean, people still write the most vile stuff about her. But there’s also the most amazing engagement and rapture around her work, especially from younger women. Only yesterday, I came upon her entry in the Urban Dictionary…” With a smile, he reads it to me. It calls Dworkin “the most iconic radical feminist EVERERRR” and deploys several exclamation marks for emphasis. Continue reading...","Sun, 23 Feb 2025 15:00:38 GMT",0.3612,0.8544

Secondhand Trumpism will only alienate its voters furtherWhat times these are. As Donald Trump’s sellout of Ukraine gains pace, there are reports that Keir Starmer will flatter the president by inviting him to address parliament. Meanwhile, Trump’s British admirers continue to offer flimsy excuses and undimmed admiration. Before Trump paid tribute to Nigel Farage – a “great guy” – in his address to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) gathering in Washington, the MP for Clacton used his time at the same event to “hail” Trump’s “progress” with Vladimir Putin, and salute him as “simply the bravest man that I know”. By way of bathos, the dependably ridiculous Liz Truss had by then told a much smaller crowd that the country she ran for a month and a half is “failing”, and needs its own Trumpian insurgency.At the top of the party Truss so briefly led, Kemi Badenoch cannot resolve a familiar contradiction – between a dazzled liking of Trump’s ideology, and the political inconvenience of what it means in practice. Late last week, she parroted the obligatory half-arsed rebuttal of Trump’s attack on the Ukrainian president. “President Zelenskyy is not a dictator,” she said, as if that were a revelation. But any observer of her recent engagements will know where her heart really lies.John Harris is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Sun, 23 Feb 2025 12:42:16 GMT",0.0,0.8912
The Guardian,What can Keir Starmer say at the White House that Donald Trump might listen to? | Andrew Rawnsley,"The stakes couldn’t be higher and the risks couldn’t be greater when the prime minister visits Washington this weekFor British prime ministers, with their ideas about the world shaped by the histories of Churchill and Roosevelt, Maggie and Ronnie, and the rest of the folklore about the transatlantic alliance, the prospect of a visit to the White House usually causes tingles of excitement. One of our senior diplomats once offered me an explanation of the allure: “The red carpet is laid out, the national anthems are played, all that stuff is very seductive.” This will be customarily accompanied by ritualistic words about the importance and invincibility of the “special relationship”.Number 10 lobbied hard to get Sir Keir Starmer across the Atlantic early in the second term of Donald Trump and, until recently, Downing Street people were telling themselves that an encounter between the two men needn’t be a disaster and might even turn out to be a success. In the weeks since Trump’s re-election as US president, UK policy might be summarised by the phrase “Don’t poke the beast”. Keep the temperature cool. Ignore provocations. Attempt to trade on British heritage – golf, the royal family – with which this US president has an affinity. Put David Lammy out there to suggest that there is lots to respect about the man whom the foreign secretary used to call a “woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath”.

The Guardian,Trump’s bullshit blitz has Europe on its knees | Stewart Lee,"For the US president’s cheerleaders, the whitewashing of the deaths of ten of thousands of Ukrainians is a small price to pay for sticking it to the wokeratiWas it really only a month ago that the pole-dancer patron, fridge explorer, Brexit get-doer, model bus maker, sofa-strainer, wall-spaffer, current Daily Mail columnist and former British prime minister Boris Johnson eulogised the inauguration of Donald Trump in the Mail, recounting how, as the “invisible pulse of power surged” from the battered bible into the hand of Trump: “I saw the moment the world’s wokerati had worked so hard to prevent.”I hope Johnson is pleased with the way things have worked out. Because now the foolish wokerati have been schooled beyond Johnson’s wettest dreams. It’s the Trump-Putin-bin Salman party! An adjudicated sex offender and convicted fraudster, and a man who sanctioned a chemical warfare hit, killing a British citizen on British soil, have met at the luxury Saudia Arabian hotel of another man, who, according to the US, reportedly approved the murder and subsequent dismemberment of a journalist, to discuss the similarly brutal dismemberment of Ukraine, without consulting either Ukraine itself or the countries most directly affected by the legitimisation of Putin’s territorial anxieties. Don’t worry, Poland! Stable genius Trump has got this covered, so break out the bone saws, pop the cork on the novichok and grab the girls by the pussy! There are 1970s Italian slasher films with less gruesome plotlines. Well said, Boris Johnson!

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Labour arts policy: time to make history again | Editorial,"Sixty years ago this week, Jennie Lee launched Britain’s first culture white paper. Lisa Nandy must pick up the batonThe date is not in many history books. But it should be. It is 60 years on Tuesday since Britain’s first minister for the arts, Jennie Lee, published the first UK government&nbsp;white paper on the arts. The white paper, which crammed more into 18 pages than many government documents do at 10 times that length, was&nbsp;a landmark, an attempt to set out “a&nbsp;more&nbsp;coherent, generous and imaginative approach” to the arts policy this country lacked.The current culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, has yet to publish such a white paper herself. She ought to do so. Nevertheless, last week she did the next best thing, travelling to Stratford-upon-Avon, the most iconic location on these islands in which to reflect on arts policy, to deliver an anniversary lecture in Buzz&nbsp;Goodbody’s experimental Other Place theatre.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Haiti’s deepening crisis: abandoning people when they most need support | Editorial,"As security and humanitarian conditions deteriorate even further, the community needs helpA year ago, it seemed that Haiti had hit rock bottom. Violence had exploded and conditions had deteriorated following President Jovenel Moïse’s assassination in 2021. Then, last February, gangs banded together to free thousands of prisoners, besiege airports and police stations, and demand that Haiti’s unpopular replacement leader departed.Ariel Henry was ousted, but the nation has only spiralled further into crisis. Violence intensified again towards the end of last year. Armed criminals control 85% of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Already desperate circumstances have become much more so: more than a million people – around one in 10 of the population – have now been displaced, triple the level a year ago.

There are no marks for artistic merit, no specific rewards (beyond a try bonus point) for throwing the ball around in the name of entertainment. Occasionally, though, there are days when the losers’ enterprise and energy leaves the deepest impression.None more so, at long last, than Wales. After barely four training sessions under their interim head coach, Matt Sherratt, they looked a team who have not so much had an extreme makeover as assumed a whole fresh identity. Last time out they were gloomily trudging through Italian treacle; suddenly they were running and passing with elan and briefly threatening to cause the mother of all tournament upsets.

A ruthless 11-try demolition of a handy Italy side on their own patch served as a reminder that, on their day, there are few better outfits in rugby than a French team in full flow.Fabien Galthié, the head coach, made some bold selection decisions, dropping his ace wing Damian Penaud and fly-half Matthieu Jalibert from the match-day 23. A seven-one bench split was a sign of the plan and France’s power game duly delivered. They stomped over the gainline with just about every carry, unloaded six heavies off the bench in one go on 48 minutes and pulverised the Italians, who sparkled on rare occasions but were totally outgunned.

But two scientists exploring which items from our technological civilisation are most likely to survive for many millions of years as fossils have reached an ironic but instructive conclusion: fast food and fast fashion will be our everlasting geological signature.“Plastic will definitely be a signature ‘technofossil’, because it is incredibly durable, we are making massive amounts of it, and it gets around the entire globe,” says the palaeontologist Prof Sarah Gabbott, a University of Leicester expert on the way that fossils form. “So wherever those future civilisations dig, they are going to find plastic.

The Guardian,Jerry Butler obituary,"Singer nicknamed ‘the Iceman’ whose hits included Only the Strong Survive and Hey, Western Union ManWhen a Philadelphia radio disc jockey gave the young Jerry Butler the nickname of “the Iceman”, it was in recognition of the singer’s avoidance of on-stage histrionics rather than any lack of warmth in his polished but ardent delivery.Butler, who has died aged 85, had hits across three decades, with records that spanned the evolution of African-American popular music, from the gospel-influenced doo-wop of For Your Precious Love, aimed at the teenagers of the 1950s, through the suave balladry of Moon River and Make It Easy on Yourself in the 60s, to the sophisticated boudoir soul of I Want to Do It to You in the 70s.

The Guardian,Copper Bottom review – a green marvel in every sense,"Adrian James’s copper-clad, energy-generating new home on the outskirts of Oxford is a triumph of style and sustainabilityWe’re used by now to buildings that declare their greenness; that proudly display their timber construction or hemp panels or wind turbines for the world to see; that make an architectural story out of their care for the atmosphere. And why not. But a striking aspect of Copper Bottom, a new house by the architect Adrian James, is that, apart from being in the most literal sense coloured green, it gives little sense of its sustainability. It looks at first sight like a carefree exploration of built form – a WTF YOLO 3D doodle; a fun folly conceived with no particular thought for the environment.James once worked for the brilliantly original British postmodernist John Outram, since when he has been ploughing his own distinctive furrow in Oxford. He and his practice design housing, commercial and education buildings, single private houses, a yoga studio. Nearly 30 years ago he announced himself with a full-bodied, barrel-vaulted Thameside house in the city, with notes of ancient Egypt and warehouse construction, for himself and his wife, Sarah. Now, having raised a family there, they have built Copper Bottom for the next stage of their lives. It sits on the very edge of the city (a 15-minute bike ride from the centre), just where a lush part of Oxford’s green belt starts, with views back to the dreaming spires.

The Guardian,"‘Photography is therapy for me’: Martin Parr on humour, holidaying and life behind the lens","He has a prolific career and extensive portfolio, with his images of British life especially iconic. At 72, he tells Miranda Sawyer, he’s still thinking about what to shoot nextAbout 20 years ago, I was on a judging panel for a photography competition, and one of the other judges was Martin Parr. He was charming and affable, almost teddy bear-ish. He was also utterly ruthless. When it came to deciding which photographs were worthy of a prize, he went through the selection swiftly – no, no, yes, no – without hesitation or doubt. His eye was impeccable.
 Has he always known what makes a good photograph? “Oh yes,” says Parr. “Right from the beginning. Total conviction. I knew I would be a photographer from the age of 13, 14, and I knew what was good even then. I was obsessive about photography. All artists are obsessive, I think.”
 We are in his agent’s office, a small upstairs flat on a market street in east London. Parr owns the building, and this room used to be packed with his work as well as Parr-type things: his collections of Saddam Hussein watches, Soviet-space-dog ephemera, Spice Girls merch. He was obsessed with gathering all sorts of daft stuff, but he’s stopped now to concentrate solely on his work. Though as he says, “photography is a form of collecting.”His obsession now is the Martin Parr Foundation, headquartered in Bristol, which he established in 2017 and which is where all of his photos have been moved to (along with the watches, space dogs and Spiceys). The foundation is a collection of documentary photography of the British Isles, his own and other people’s. Alongside maintaining Parr’s huge archive, it buys work by lesser-known photographers, gives bursaries to those who are just starting out, has a library and gallery, curates shows, and is Parr’s legacy, what he’s most proud of. He’s 72, is in cancer recovery and is conscious of his age. “Hopefully it will be of some benefit,” he says. “I’m not going to say I’m saving the world. I never expect photography to change anything.” Perhaps not, but the Foundation is clearly a good thing: the website is great and the current show, featuring Siân Davey’s photos of family life, is excellent.
 “Have you been to visit it?” he asks. I haven’t. He looks a bit miffed. He’s quick to pick up on things he thinks I’ve missed about what he does. When we go for a coffee after the interview, he says, almost triumphantly, “You just missed me taking a photo with my phone, of that wall!”
 In my defence, there is so much of Parr’s work to see that you could spend your whole life looking at his photographs. He’s been working since the 1980s, has had well over 80 exhibitions all over the world, has published more than 145 photography books. He is madly prolific, with an archive that’s endlessly recategorisable. “If you want me to do a book on dogs, no problem,” he says. “I can come up with 100 pictures straight away. Or cigarettes. I’ve just done a book called No Smoking, using my archive, edited by my gallery here in London.”
 Is he constantly thinking about work?
 “More or less, yes. I’m either thinking about things I haven’t shot, or things I’ve done. What’s got to be done. What can I do next? Where can I go?” Continue reading...","Sun, 23 Feb 2025 07:00:28 GMT",0.4767,0.9695
The Guardian,Gugu Mbatha-Raw: ‘It’s good to trust your gut’,"The British actor Gugu Mbatha-Raw has worked with Reece Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey, been awarded an MBE and told stories that have challenged perceptions around race. So what, asks Rhik Samadder, keeps her so grounded? Early on in Gugu Mbatha-Raw’s career, an older, white actor advised she change her name to something easier to pronounce. She declined – a strong choice for a young actor. “I don’t think it’s that strong,” rebuts Mbatha-Raw. She likes her name. Besides, “it means ‘Our Pride’ in Zulu. To change that would be the antithesis of its meaning.”Mbatha-Raw is known for choosing roles that combine art and social advocacy. She’s won awards, been honoured with an MBE, appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Refugee Agency. People still mispronounce her name, though. The most extreme example she recalls was in Norway, when a host announced her from a piece of paper. “Gucci… Matthew… Ray?

Felicity Cloake tries out supermarket takes on chilled, ready-made chicken and vegetable soup• The best blenders to blitz like a pro, tried and testedAs a small child, my dream was to open an underwater restaurant (no, me neither), and the short menu I painstakingly wrote out for said venture started with chicken and vegetable soup. Which is to say, I have history with this dish. It feels familiar, comforting and overwhelmingly wholesome, yet I don’t often eat it these days, not least because I’ve never found one commercially that makes any welfare claims for the chicken concerned (and I’m generally too cheap to make it myself).So I was quite excited about this particular taste test – and perhaps inevitably disappointed that even the most expensive samples gave so little information about the provenance of their meat. That said, with a handful of exceptions, the standard was pretty high flavour-wise, and Aldi, Marks &amp; Spencer, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s all at least note that they use British chicken, which is a start.

As with other staples – denim, T-shirts, tailoring et al – it’s an investment that will go beyond any trend or season. So, if you buy the right pieces, you’ll likely wear them for years to come.With that in mind, there are a few things to consider when hitting the shops. Above all, it’s best to choose jumpers you know are made well, using good fabrics. That means you should go for brands you can trust in terms of craftsmanship and stick to natural fibres, such as cotton, wool and cashmere. Unlike human-made textiles, these are naturally breathable and temperature-regulating so they’re more comfortable and better for your skin. This sometimes means the price is a little higher than a fast-fashion buy, but they tend to last longer – just be sure to keep them protected when moth season hits.

The Guardian,"Caroline Lucas: ‘I can’t imagine my parents ever voted Green, but they became less antagonistic’","The former Green MP on patriotism, protest and and why Labour is much less ambitious than its votersIt’s tempting to think of Caroline Lucas as a kind of spirit of place in Brighton. She has arrived first at Food for Friends, the oldest vegetarian restaurant in the city, and there is something almost mythical in seeing the pioneering Green MP in its window seat, facing the Lanes, framed by trailing foliage. She has been coming here for as long as she can remember, she says – the restaurant opened in 1981 and used to have folk queuing around the block. She recommends the blueberry and ginger “nojito”, orders the Thai noodle salad and crispy tofu, and half apologises for still being “a vegetarian on the road to veganism” without quite yet arriving at that destination.It’s nine months since Lucas stepped down after 14 years in parliament as her party’s first and, in that time, only MP. I sense that she is still getting used to this kind of thing – leisurely lunches on a weekday, without somewhere to dash off to. She is, rightly, adamant that she has not retired. Far from it: she remains a tireless activist on the issues she cares about – the environment and the climate crisis, and Britain’s return to Europe (among several other patron and ambassador roles she is co-president of the European Movement with the former attorney general Dominic Grieve). She is writing a children’s book, and has an acclaimed adult one already out – called Another England, and one reason for our lunch. It’s about the idea of England, and “how to reclaim our national story”. Continue reading...","Sun, 23 Feb 2025 12:00:36 GMT",0.0,0.1063

The Guardian,The big picture: the jubilation of clubbing in 90s London,"Photographer Ewen Spencer captures the energy of a garage music night for working-class kidsEwen Spencer took this picture at a Sunday club night called Twice As Nice at The End in London’s West Central Street in 1999. He’d been a regular there back in the days when it was held at the Colosseum in Vauxhall, south of the river. The move to the West End signalled that its garage music was becoming more a mainstream part of culture. Spencer, who grew up in Newcastle upon Tyne, had been documenting underground party nights for a decade by then for magazines such as the Face and i-D. He was a soul boy at heart, and saw in garage culture similar attractions: “It was working-class kids dressing up for a big night out,” he recalls, “quite different from acid house, for example.”Spencer’s picture is included in a new Hayward Gallery touring exhibition After the End of History: British Working Class Photography 1989-2024. Spencer was influenced by north-east based photographers such as Chris Killip and Graham Smith; he wanted to make authentic pictures that captured “some of the moves and female-heavy love and jubilation of those nights”, he says.After the End of History: British Working Class Photography 1989-2024 is at Stills, Edinburgh, 21 March to 28 June Continue reading...","Sun, 23 Feb 2025 07:00:29 GMT",0.0,0.9571
The Guardian,A new branch of photography? Found images of women in trees – in pictures,"For 25 years, Hamburg-based collector Jochen Raiß scoured flea markets for historical amateur photographs. After finding a photo of a woman smiling in a tree, he started to notice this was a recurrent theme, especially popular between the 1920s and 1950s. Over the years he accumulated 91 such photos, now collected into a book, Women in Trees. “A number of the photographers have created images that possess a remarkable depth and beauty,” he wrote in the book’s introduction. “The women exert a great effort to hold on to these trees without losing their balance. Their Sunday dresses and fashionable shoes stand in stark contrast to the nature around them.”Women in Trees by Jochen Raiß and Johanna Adorjan is out now (Hatje Cantz, £18) Continue reading...","Sat, 22 Feb 2025 17:00:12 GMT",0.0,0.9537

The Guardian,"‘It was so fleeting, yet weirdly they were almost posing’: Richard Chambury’s best phone photo","The London photographer always saw odd things going on while cycling at weekends, but nothing quite like this …You’d be forgiven for thinking this shot was taken during the pandemic; an inventive, impromptu attempt at masking up, perhaps. Instead, Richard Chambury took it in the spring of 2013, in London’s Victoria Park.“My daughter was 11 and to get her out and about on the weekends we used to go cycling,” Chambury says. “We eventually discovered this was not her favourite pastime; she’s a reader, and likes the warmth. But we always saw odd things going on, people doing the morning walk of shame dolled up from the night before, or wild birds and swans knocking about.” Continue reading...","Sat, 22 Feb 2025 10:00:04 GMT",0.4091,0.0925
