His sixth novel, The Narrow Road to the Deep North, which drew on his father’s experience as a Japanese prisoner of war, won the 2014 Booker prize and is about to become a TV series starring Saltburn’s Jacob Elordi. His latest book, Question 7, is on the shortlist of this year’s Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction (to be awarded on 19 November), having also been shortlisted for France’s Prix Femina Étranger, a prize for novels. For the Spectator, it “uses an eccentric toolkit – part memoir, part history, part fictional imagining – to produce a book quite unlike anything else”; for Peter Carey, it “may just be the most significant work of Australian art in the last 100 years”.How do you feel about Question 7 being up for a fiction prize as well as a nonfiction prize?
 Delighted. Labels are for jam jars.What led you to write it?
 A mistaken diagnosis of early onset dementia in 2022. I was given at best 12 months before it would begin in earnest. In those 12 months I wrote the book. When done, I asked my editor if it showed any signs of cognitive collapse; if it did, I didn’t wish to see it published. She began laughing. The neurologist subsequently confirmed her opinion.Which of the book’s many threads came first?
 Once I had the idea of writing the book as a chain reaction that begins with Rebecca West kissing HG Wells and leads to 100,000 people dying in Hiroshima, my father living and me being born – once I understood that without that kiss, there would be no bomb and no me – then disparate things that had haunted me for so long fell into place. I thought much about my parents who, in a world they knew to be meaningless, nevertheless asserted an idea of love as their answer to the horrors out of which my island home is torn.Wells’s novel The War of the Worlds is pivotal to the narrative. Do you remember the first time you read it?
 I thought I knew the story – yet when I first read it, perhaps 20 years ago, I was staggered to learn in Wells’s introduction that it was inspired by the extermination of Aboriginal Tasmanians. It isn’t a hokey Edwardian set piece. It’s an indictment of English imperialism.Are you a restless writer? Your books are similar to one another mainly in their difference …
 I’m easily bored. And then there’s age. I seek forms that account not just for what’s lost but reflect what’s gained.Were you inspired this time by the discursive turn that English-language fiction has taken since WG Sebald?
 Fashions come and go. With this book, what mattered above all wasn’t literature, but life. During Covid, life for us all seemed on hold. The question I was left with was: do we wish to live, or are we content just to exist? And I think that question haunted many. Continue reading...","Sat, 16 Nov 2024 18:00:44 GMT",-0.2411,0.9734
The Guardian,Are cancer survivors less likely to develop Alzheimer’s?,"Research shows that patients with a history of cancer are less likely to develop dementia and those with Alzheimer’s are less likely to develop cancer. Understanding this relationship, say scientists, could lead to new treatmentsWith age comes disease. Cancer and Alzheimer’s dementia are among the commonest and most feared health conditions – particularly in countries with ageing populations such as the UK. Several decades ago, researchers at a psychiatric centre in New York observed a curious relationship between these two diseases. At autopsy, they found an inverse relation between cancer and Alzheimer’s disease.In one of the first epidemiological studies on the topic Jane Driver of Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts in the US followed 1,278 participants aged 65 and older for a mean of 10 years. Published in 2012, the results showed that cancer survivors had a 33% decreased risk of subsequently developing Alzheimer’s disease compared with people without a history of cancer.

The Guardian,"So, it’s goodbye to Gary Linker and to the costly, star-struck culture at the BBC | Martha Gill","The presenter’s departure from Match of the Day reveals a welcome shift at the BBC, but fame worship lingersIs the age of the megastar fading at the BBC? It is possible to read too much into Gary Lineker’s retirement, which has dominated headlines. Some have wondered if this heralds a general ousting of “the woke” from public life – Lineker was famous for his outspoken “lefty” views. Others reckon the decision stems from an outbreak of tall poppy syndrome; the public were jealous and hounded him out.Lineker himself has hinted that his move has something to do with upcoming changes to Match of the Day. But Lineker is also remarkable for his salary, about £1.35m a year, making him the corporation’s highest earner. Will his successor be paid as much? It’s unlikely.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The EU is under siege from present-day descendants of the Goths, Mongols and Vandals. But what were top MEPs doing? Haggling over who gets which well-padded seat in the European Commission – as if it really matters in a chaotic, predatory world where Europe is a tethered, bleating goat surrounded by wolves.Vladimir Putin’s Russian horde is advancing from the north, devouring Ukrainian territory and setting the stage for more illegal annexations. To the east, Xi Jinping’s China, leveraging a whopping €292bn (£244bn) annual trade surplus, is playing European divide-and-rule while running aggressive covert intelligence and hacking ops. To the west, after an electoral clean sweep, America’s Vandal-in-chief is itching for a fight. Continue reading...","Sat, 16 Nov 2024 17:00:43 GMT",0.0,0.0258

The Guardian,"You say bap, I say bread cake, but do delivery apps mean regional food names are becoming a thing of the past? | Rachel Cooke","A sourdough-and-rocket monotony is spreading outwards from the M25. I worry about what we’re losingI have a vivid memory of arriving at university at the back end of the 1980s and telling someone I needed to buy a bread cake, at which point I remembered (too late!) that most people call the round baked item in question a bap or a roll. The term bread cake – no, it has nothing whatsoever to do with cake – is highly regional: a&nbsp;South Yorkshire and, at a push, East Midlands thing. If I’d been wearing a&nbsp;Tracey Emin-style neon sign on my head that said, “I am from elsewhere, possibly another planet”, I couldn’t have announced myself more clearly. Not that I was embarrassed – and in any case, old habits die hard. On Sunday mornings, when I make bacon sandwiches, the floury baps that I like to use, soft as pillows, are still bread cakes to me. They&nbsp;always will be.The experience I describe was, however, a long time ago and, today, as I think about making pease pudding for dinner (I’m joking; of course we’re having pasta), I find myself wondering about regional differences when it comes to food. Do they belong, now, to the past? Admittedly, it’s still hard to lay your hands on parkin in London: Gail’s Bakery looks to Europe, not Leeds, its nose in the air and a silk scarf tied firmly around its neck. But Eccles cakes and Cornish pasties are ubiquitous now, and I’ve seen haslet with my own eyes at the Islington branch of Tesco (a&nbsp;herby meat loaf, haslet is very good in bread cakes, so long as they’re thickly buttered). Neal’s Yard Dairy, the fine cheesemonger, sells Staffordshire oatcakes. Leave the capital, meanwhile, and you will find that a sourdough-and-rocket-inflected monotony is spreading ever outwards from the M25. Continue reading...","Sat, 16 Nov 2024 17:00:44 GMT",0.0,0.6517

There’s a vaccine sceptic in at health, a misogynist as attorney general, a possible Russia sympathiser as director of national intelligence and first choice for defence is a Fox News anchorman. Oh, and the new US ambassador to Israel believes there’s no such thing as the West Bank.Yet what they may lack in intellectual rigour, moral rectitude and empathy, they more than compensate for in fake tans, chiselled jaws and mistresses. Where once Gordon Brown worked to build a “goat” (government of all talents), Trump is opting for a government of old goats.

But there was concerning news last week with new figures showing the economy grew by just 0.1% in the three months to the end of September, falling significantly short of expectations.Some business leaders have linked this anaemic growth to uncertainty in the run-up to last month’s budget.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Testing times: Cricket’s traditions are being clean bowled by cash | Editorial,"Old-school charm faces off against big-money leagues, as short-form tournaments threaten to sideline the  old orderTwo cricketing worlds collide next week. Australia and India meet on Friday in Perth in the opening Test of what promises to be an epic encounter –&nbsp;the first five-match series between the two great rivals since 1991-92. Five-match Test series used to be the norm. However, with the exception of England&nbsp;v&nbsp;Australia, they have become rare. One‑day cricket, and&nbsp;especially&nbsp;Twenty20, has eroded the time&nbsp;available&nbsp;for the longest form of the game, forcing&nbsp;series to be shortened to three or even two matches. What used to be a novel lasting all summer has become a novella, over in a trice. But in this Australian summer, something like tradition again rules. Five Tests spread over a month and a half, with the Christmas and new year Tests in Melbourne and Sydney in their time‑honoured place.The new cricket world, however, won’t let tradition dominate. Just two days after the Perth Test begins, the Indian Premier League (IPL) “mega-auction” will unfold in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, underscoring the desert kingdom’s growing influence in global sports.

As parents who have been estranged for three years from our daughter, we too can testify to the sheer pain and sense of bereavement which occurs when estrangement happens out of the blue, and which is rightly highlighted in the article.Like others, we have followed the psychologist Joshua Coleman’s excellent guidance and observations very carefully in an attempt to try to come to terms with this horrible experience, and welcome the fact that he highlights the role of therapists. There are many excellent professional therapists out there.

So it was disarming to find myself standing in the cramped galley kitchen of a ground-floor flat in north London with one of the world’s greatest living painters as he made us coffee.“I only have instant, I’m afraid,” said Auerbach. “And sorry about the mess.” Continue reading...","Sat, 16 Nov 2024 16:00:45 GMT",0.6249,0.3612
The Guardian,"‘She gave me the chance that became my life’: Jeanette Winterson on her first editor, Philippa Brewster","The pioneering feminist editor and publisher died in October. The Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit author looks back on the close friendship they sharedI met Philippa Brewster in 1983. She was a commissioning editor at Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul – in&nbsp;those days an independent London publisher, specialising in nonfiction. Philippa had been given the go-ahead by RKP to launch Pandora Press. Back&nbsp;then, publishing was a male-dominated industry. Editors were men, authors were men, reviewers were men. This was normal. Feminism had begun to change the normal.Virago led the field in 1973, initially republishing female writers whose work had gone out of print. The Women’s Press, founded in 1978, was more directly political, and interested in the work of women of colour whose voices were not heard. Philippa saw a&nbsp;gap in the market for a nonfiction imprint covering history, biography, travel, cultural studies – the kind of books she was already championing as an editor, now given the boost of their own brand and a marketing budget.

The Guardian,Amyl and the Sniffers review – nonstop fireworks,"Roundhouse, LondonThe Aussie rockers led by the magnetic Amy Taylor showcase new album Cartoon Darkness with an explosive set that just keeps giving and givingPart of the appeal of the Roundhouse, a famous north London venue, is that if a gig ever becomes boring, you can gaze at its vaulted, jointed ceiling – a marvel of the industrial age. It’s a safe bet that no one checks the architecture tonight, or on the other two nights of this sold-out residency. Because punk crossover stars Amyl and the Sniffers are never dull: they go off like a long-haul firecracker, detonating time and again.Their ingredients are, yes, consistent – the thuggish judder of Gus Romer’s bass, the wallop of Bryce Wilson’s drums, the unapologetic squall of Declan Mehrtens’s electric guitar and singer Amy Taylor’s fierce invective – against predatory men, internet trolls and people who seek to muzzle her. They often feel like the same set of adversaries. But the Australian band rebuild their pub-glam-punk rock Lego again and again, with surprising variety.

The Guardian,Soundtrack to a Coup d’Etat review – superb study of how jazz got caught between the cold war and the CIA,"Johan Grimonprez’s fascinating documentary uses the assassination of DRC prime minister Patrice Lumumba to launch a dizzying look into the politics of jazz in the 1950s and 60sIt’s been quite a year for thrillingly inventive music documentaries. First there was Gary Hustwit’s Eno, a groundbreaking portrait of the pioneering musician, producer and artist that tore up the rules of cinema and reinvented itself with each new screening. And now there’s Belgian film-maker Johan Grimonprez’s dazzling Soundtrack to a Coup d’Etat, a breathtaking, ideas-packed journey that weaves together American jazz and the geopolitical machinations of the 1950s and 60s. It’s almost reductive to describe this extraordinary essay film as a music documentary – it’s about so much: the cold war; the bloody fingerprints of colonialism in Africa; the 1961 assassination of Patrice Lumumba, prime minister of the newly independent Democratic Republic of the Congo; Nikita Khrushchev’s shoe. But linking it all is an eye-opening exploration of the politics of jazz, and the music itself, freewheeling and skittish and pulsing through every frame.This densely detailed and fascinating film skips between timelines and continents. It covers the CIA’s use of unwitting jazz musicians (Louis Armstrong, for example) as distractions to cover their political meddling in various countries. It touches on the incredible Andrée Blouin – Lumumba’s adviser and speechwriter, women’s rights activist and a figure who warrants a whole other documentary dedicated to her remarkable life. There are snippets of adverts for iPhones and Teslas, acknowledging how the mineral resources of the DRC made it such a prized target for colonial powers, and tying the country’s past to the unfolding story in the present day. Informative, exhaustively researched, but never dry or didactic, this is a phenomenal achievement by Grimonprez, who holds his own country to account for its shameful role in this sorry tale.In UK and Irish cinemas Continue reading...","Sat, 16 Nov 2024 15:00:41 GMT",0.0516,0.8976

The Guardian,Trend watch: get ready for a country weekend,"Argyle knits and plaid coats, tweeds and wool… This season the heritage look is back. The aim? Off-duty royal at BalmoralFashion’s longstanding love of heritage and dressing up in the style of those attending country-house weekends has dominated the runways this season, from Chloé’s cape silhouette plaid coat to Wales Bonner’s check barn jacket styled over a dark tweed two piece. Meanwhile labels such as Margaret Howell and Stefan Cooke have adopted hardwearing tweed, styled with denim or paired with a knit, and heavy-duty wool trousers in a palette of autumn hues, from mustard, olive green and russet to rich chestnut brown. It’s a look suitable for long walks in the countryside, with textured wool coats layered over quilted and canvas barn jackets, such as Mango’s contrasting collar version (6, below) or Sezane’s flap pocket design in camel, £285.Knitwear is the foundation to this look, an argyle cardigan or jumper that’s reminiscent of Brideshead Revisited, the Mitford sisters and off-duty royals at Balmoral. The argyle knit is a great entry-point to this trend, and &amp;Daughter’s Ava sweater (£395), made in Hawick, Scotland, is the real deal, made with responsible Wool Standard-certified wool. On the high street, M&amp;S (10) has a simplified graphic take on the design (£35). There are also plenty of pre-loved iterations to be found, for example at Beyond Retro and eBay. For day, keep things practical with flat boots: Whistles lugsole knee-high pair (£259) have an equestrian vibe that works for the trend. Alternatively, Blundstone’s ankle boots (£190) come in a variety of colours and weather-appropriate finishes. Mixing textures and pattern is key, try checks with wool and throw in some embellishment to stay on the right side of cosplay. Continue reading...","Sat, 16 Nov 2024 23:55:52 GMT",0.3612,0.9349
The Guardian,"What a carve up! Playful, intricate Japanese leaf art – in pictures","Almost every day for the past five years, the Kanagawa-born artist Lito has drawn an image on to a leaf – usually a jaunty scene from the animal world involving, say, a biker-dude rabbit or a frog in a phone box – and carved it out with a scalpel before posting a photograph to social media. A painstaking process, it nonetheless suits Lito’s “propensity to devote long hours to detailed work” – a diagnosis of ADHD aged 30 was what prompted him to quit his corporate job and start carving leaves for a living. And a living it is: he’s sold 300,000 copies of his leaf-art books to date and exhibits his work throughout Japan. The combination of playful Studio Ghibli-esque imagination and exhaustive attention to detail is central to the appeal.See more on Instagram at lito_leafart Continue reading...","Sat, 16 Nov 2024 17:00:44 GMT",0.5848,0.7184
