The Guardian,Smoggie Queens review – an adorably sweet drag sitcom,"This series about a tight-knit queer community joyfully celebrates British camp culture – from deadpan humour to loving Lorraine Kelly. What a shame it’s not more funnyDickie is a drag queen – but not a very good one. For a start, he finds it impossible to get his eyebrows right: they’re usually scrawled haphazardly across the upper reaches of his forehead. And while his every utterance comes suffused with bitchy energy, he flounders during any actual war-of-wits. What Dickie does have, however, is a ridiculously inflated sense of self-worth: in the grand tradition of sitcom monsters, his three defining personality traits are vanity, delusion and a spectacular dearth of talent. When his boyfriend decides he’s had enough of this “selfish, egotistical prick”, Dickie’s impulse is to soften his heart with a repulsively flat rendition of Make You Feel My Love, which is cut short when he is hit by a car. Needless to say, he doesn’t get his man back.Dickie would probably like to think he is the star of Smoggie Queens – the brainchild of comedian Phil Dunning, who plays him – but he’s not; this Middlesbrough-set sitcom (Smoggie is a nickname for someone from the area) is very much an ensemble piece. In fact, that’s the whole point: the show’s primary theme is “chosen family” – a group of friends that are a staple of LGBTQ+ communities. Dickie’s clan includes kindly middle-aged drag queen Mam (played by a masterfully disguised Mark Benton; I gasped when I saw his name on the credits), stony-faced wannabe singer Sal, token heterosexual Lucinda and naive newbie Stewart, whose youth is taken as an act of outright hostility by the ageing Dickie.

Yet Biden’s flowery self-congratulation jars at this fragile moment. It sounds like cruel mockery to the beleaguered people of Gaza.With the truce holding for a second day – despite some apparent breaches – Lebanon has been spared more death and wanton destruction, for now. Many people are celebrating and heading home to the south despite Israeli warnings. But Biden’s belief that the accord will hasten a Gaza ceasefire, spike the guns of Iran and its proxies, and open the way to the wider regional settlement he has long sought finds scant justification in fact.Simon Tisdall is the Observer’s foreign affairs commentatorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Direct Line, on the other hand, is a troubled FTSE 250 insurer with a new-ish chief executive, Adam Winslow, whose turnaround plan has not been applauded wildly by the stock market.Aviva’s 250p-a-share, or £3.3bn, offer for Direct Line therefore looks to be the opening shot in a negotiation.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on the ‘spy cops’ inquiry: police lies are finally being exposed | Editorial,"It is due to the courage of victims that we are learning why these undercover officers behaved as they didEven for those familiar with parts of the stories about women who were deceived into intimate relationships&nbsp;with undercover police officers, the evidence that has emerged in recent weeks has been&nbsp;shocking. The litany of destructive behaviour either carried out by, or caused by, officers deployed&nbsp;to&nbsp;spy on campaigners, who were mostly active in leftwing causes, is being laid bare as never before: self-harm, heroin use, unprotected sex leading&nbsp;to emergency contraception, coercive control&nbsp;and the sudden abandonment of female partners and children.On Tuesday, Belinda Harvey told the public inquiry how she was manipulated by Bob Lambert, who tricked at least three other women into relationships as well. The son he had with one of them, and abandoned as a toddler, did not learn the truth for decades. The Metropolitan&nbsp;police has since paid the son an undisclosed amount, along with £425,000 to his mother, known as Jacqui. Continue reading...","Thu, 28 Nov 2024 18:57:04 GMT",-0.4767,-0.8942
The Guardian,The Guardian view on Nasa’s next frontier: exploring the hidden oceans of Uranus is worth it | Editorial,"What lies beneath this ice giant’s surface might be the potential for life – but not as we know itFor nearly 40 years, Uranus and its five largest moons have been dismissed as frozen and lifeless. This view was formed by humanity’s only close encounter with the Uranian system at the edge of our cosmic neighbourhood. Data sent back by Voyager 2 in 1986 indicated that the distant ice giant was sterile and inactive. But that probe had the misfortune of flying past Uranus just when a powerful solar storm hit, creating a distorted impression of its true nature. Far from the barren worlds previously assumed, a new analysis suggests that the celestial bodies could hold hidden oceans, and perhaps even the conditions necessary to support life.This news should put rocket boosters on the $4bn&nbsp;plan by Nasa, the US space agency, for a mission to return to Uranus. The clock is ticking to make it there by 2050, just in time for its planetary equinox, when sunlight floods Uranus and its moons from pole to pole. Nasa wants to launch a mission by 2032 – a timeline that allows the spacecraft to use Jupiter’s massive gravity like a slingshot and shoot a probe out to Uranus in time for its seasonal transition.

The Guardian,Cop29: poorer countries are left shortchanged again | Letters,"Chiara Liguori says the richest and biggest polluters must be targeted to finance the green transition, while Steve Brown says there is no sign of a transition away from fossil fuels. Plus Philippe Delacote, Tara L’Horty, Anna Creti and Andreas Kontoleon on flaws in carbon credit marketsEd Miliband is right to say that “there is no route to a stable climate without supporting developing countries to embrace the clean-energy revolution” (Here’s what I learned at Cop29. Rows aside, an unstoppable transition to clean energy is happening, 25 November). However, it is misleading to suggest that the $300bn climate finance goal adopted at Cop29 to help lower-income countries tackle the climate crisis is trebling the previous figure of $100bn when it does not consider inflation adjustments.It is also a gross exaggeration to say that the deal “will help poorer countries … to decarbonise and protect their populations”. Even without accounting for inflation, it is a tiny fraction of what is needed, with much of it likely to be delivered as debt-inducing loans.

The Guardian,Cambridge water credits are a gift for developers | Letter,"Cambridge councillor Jean Glasberg on how large-scale developments can be pushed through by the government in an area that’s the driest in the countryGeorge Monbiot is right to warn us about the use of soil and carbon credits as part of “the war against reality” everywhere (Trump’s science-denying fanatics are bad enough. Yet even our climate ‘solutions’ are now the stuff of total delusion, 21 November). He omits, though, the other element essential for life on Earth: water.Perhaps he has not heard of the latest Cambridge invention: “water credits”. These have been dreamed up by a “water scarcity group” to address the problem that East Anglia, the region chosen by the government for the greatest growth, is the driest in the country. While new reservoirs are proposed, and pipelines to bring water from as far afield as Wales, it is recognised that it will be years before these are functioning. Meanwhile, large-scale proposals for new hotels, retail, offices, and homes for the thousands of people who will come to work in them, sail through the planning system regardless.

The Guardian,Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend,"Fraser Forster steps up for Spurs, while the threat level is at its highest for Manchester City at AnfieldFabian Hürzeler singled out Joël Veltman as one of the Premier League’s most underrated players as Brighton prepare to face the bottom side, Southampton, on Friday. “He knows what to do to win games,” Hürzeler said of the Netherlands defender, who has started all but one of Brighton’s league games so far. Veltman – who spent eight years at Ajax before moving to the Amex in 2020 for £900,000 – is 11 months older than his manager and his experience has proved invaluable to his side in the absence of the captain, Lewis Dunk, through injury. He is expected to return against Russell Martin’s side as Brighton attempt to record a fourth clean sheet of the league season, not to mention take the opportunity to move into second place in the table before the rest of the weekend’s fixtures.

The Guardian,Ranieri’s delight as Hummels strikes late for Roma to ruin Tottenham’s night,"Contrary to expectations, it ended as a night for travelling veterans to display their staying power. These are the moments that explain why Claudio Ranieri stepped out of retirement and, although Tottenham had enough chances to take another step towards the knockout stages, they could not complain when Mats Hummels rescued a point for Roma at the end of a contest in which neither side took much interest in defending.Spurs, who slipped outside the top eight despite taking a 2-1 lead at half-time thanks to Son Heung-min’s penalty and Brennan Johnson’s excellent goal, were guilty of a lack of control. Ange Postecoglou’s substitutions did not make his team better, although it still seemed that Ranieri’s return to London was heading for despair when Fraser Forster made a stunning stop from Gianluca Mancini’s volley during the dying stages.

The Guardian,Bomb threats target Democratic Congress members from Connecticut,"Jim Himes, Joe Courtney and John Larson report threats to their homes, a day after Trump cabinet picks targetedSeveral Democratic members of Congress from Connecticut have been targeted by bomb threats on their homes, the lawmakers or their offices said on Thursday.
 Jim Himes, Joe Courtney and John Larson all reported that their homes were the subject of bomb threats. Police who responded said they found no evidence of a bomb on the lawmakers’ properties.
 This happened a day after a number of Donald Trump’s most prominent cabinet picks and appointees reported that they had received bomb threats and “swatting attacks”, in which perpetrators initiate an emergency law enforcement response against a victim under false pretences.
 Courtney’s Vernon home received a bomb threat while his wife and children were there, his office said.
 Himes said on Thursday morning he was notified of the threat against his home during a Thanksgiving celebration with his family. The US Capitol police and Greenwich and Stamford police departments responded.
 Himes extended his family’s “utmost gratitude to our local law enforcement officers for their immediate action to ensure our safety”. He added: “There is no place for political violence in this country, and I hope that we may all continue through the holiday season with peace and civility.”
 Larson also said on Thursday that East Hartford police responded to a bomb threat against his home.
 The threats follow an election season marked by violence. In July, a gunman opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing him in the ear and killing one of his supporters. The Secret Service later thwarted a subsequent assassination attempt at Trump’s West Palm Beach golf course in Florida, when an agent spotted the barrel of a gun poking through a perimeter fence while Trump was golfing.
 Among those who received threats on Wednesday were New York representative Elise Stefanik, Trump’s pick to serve as the next ambassador to the UN; Matt Gaetz, Trump’s initial pick to serve as attorney general; Oregon representative Lori Chavez-DeRemer, who Trump chose to lead the Department of Labor, and former New York congressman Lee Zeldin, who has been tapped to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.

The Guardian,Charli xcx review – feral masterclass in pop presence heralds Brat winter,"Co-Op Live, ManchesterThe star brings hedonistic energy to this arena show, reviving the rush of her 2024-dominating sixth album with sweaty, stage-licking abandonIf there was ever something that could shock away the midweek doldrums, it’s the sight of Charli xcx spitting on the floor as she performs the remix of Guess featuring Billie Eilish, only to dive to the ground and lick it up. Hygienic? Perhaps not. But is it Brat? Clearly. This is the opening night of the Brat tour, after all.Of course, this is a show many have been waiting for. While Charli’s sixth album was only released earlier this summer, the record’s impact – from its lime-green coloured album cover, messy party girl aesthetic and subsequent co-option by political figures – has led to the kind of cultural dominance that most pop stars dream of. For Charli, it was a long time coming: having spent most of her career as pop’s most innovative outsider slowly inching her way into the mainstream, she finally shot into her imperial phase with the best album of her career.

The Guardian,"Schubert, Ter Schiphorst, Andre album review – something old, something new","Steger/Kuss Quartet(Rubicon)Alongside a rather brittle Death and the Maiden, contemporary composers Iris ter Schiphorst adds a recorder to a string quartet while Marc Andre’s miniatures study texturesWith their performance of Schubert’s best known quartet, Death and the Maiden, the Kuss Quartet include two works written specially for them by composers whose music is still little known in the UK. Iris ter Schiphorst’s Sei Gutes Muts adds a recorder (Maurice Steger) to the four strings, and introduces whispered phrases from the text of the Schubert song that forms the basis of the second movement of his D minor quartet, to which the recorder player reacts as the strings pulse around him. Marc Andre’s Seven Pieces are miniatures, the longest of them barely 100 seconds long, each a concentrated study in a technique or a string texture.Whether these three works make a convincing package is another matter. There is something rather brittle about the Kuss’s approach to the Schubert, which never quite captures the work’s extraordinary dramatic and lyrical range. In a quartet that is so familiar and which has been recorded by a century’s worth of great string ensembles, it needs something more than the addition of the two contemporary scores to make it stand out.

The Guardian,Hasse: Serpentes Ignei in Deserto album review – dazzling performances bring this oratorio of snakes on a plain to life,"Jaroussky/Orliński/De Sá/Lezhneva/Les Accents/Noally(Erato, two CDs)Thibault Noally captures the exuberance of Hasse’s 18th-century ‘church opera’ originally written for female voicesNowadays Johann Adolph Hasse (1699-1783) is best remembered as an important figure in the history of opera, a composer whose 60-odd opere serie to librettos by his friend Pietro Metastasio became immensely popular across Europe in the middle decades of the 18th century. Hasse travelled widely, and in the 1730s he divided his time between Germany and Italy, where he was regularly commissioned by the opera houses in Naples and Venice. But he produced liturgical music too, and he was appointed maestro di cappella (chorus master) to the orphanage of the Ospedale degli Incurabili in Venice.It was for the girls of the orphanage that Hasse composed his biblical oratorio Serpentes Ignei in Deserto (1734), to a text in Latin based on the Old Testament story of the serpents in the desert sent by God to punish the Israelites, until Moses’ prayers are answered and his people are saved. Serpentes Ignei is less a devotional piece than a taut, dramatic “church opera”. The tone is set in the vivid Sinfonia with which the oratorio opens, followed by eight arias and one duet for the six soloists; there is no chorus, and most of the connecting recitative is accompanied by the orchestral strings.

The Guardian,Stephanie Collie obituary,"Costume designer for TV and film – notably Peaky Blinders – acclaimed for the accuracy and range of her period detailingTelevision period drama now has its own history of more than 60 years of series and serials, with many thousands of costumes recreated to evoke eras from ancient Rome to the day before yesterday. But those designed by Stephanie Collie for the first six episodes of Peaky Blinders, shown on BBC Two in 2013, had all the shock of the new, despite that initial series being set in 1919. Period drama usually privileges the ensembles of fashionable women, but the most exciting of the Blinders costumes were for working-class dandy gangsters from the early 20th century.Previously, in adaptations of Dickens, Gaskell and Bennett, urban lower orders knew their wardrobe as well as their social place – clad in corduroy over uncollared shirts, perhaps a muffler to fill in the neck against bitter cold and a generic “cloth cap” – none of it incorrect, but without age or degree, and seldom any sexuality. Collie, who has died aged 60, perceived something far sharper during her research into Birmingham’s vintage criminals. She studied old police mugshots, plus the solid woollen cloths and narrow cuts seen at the racecourses, where Savile Row-tailored nobs dealt with horse-breeding and betting mobs who had developed their own sporting style over more than a century around the stables, including nattier caps – six-panelled, generous towards the rim and with a canvas-reinforced brim (easily razor-blade enhanced for plot purposes).

In art, it often turns up as a reminder of death. Yet walking into the Wallace Collection’s ravishing display of early 18th-century clocks by André-Charles Boulle, you find out that it can be joyous after all. There are no brooding images of mortality and Judgment day here, just dazzling timepieces that tell you to make love, be happy and face down that ticking destiny.This small but scintillating show is a time capsule of the Enlightenment and its art style, the Rococo. That may sound like a lot to load on to the clockmaker Boulle, a brilliant craftsman who also made tables, candle stands and whatever else French royalty and nobles desired at his workshop in the Louvre. Yet Boulle and the other ingenious artisans who collaborated with him were interested in philosophy and science – and it shows. At first sight, the glistening decor on a pedestal clock, complete with a golden face, looks fantastic: then you see three decorative cylinders hanging down. Beneath the mythical finery, shows Boulle, rational machinery is concealed. And it’s machinery that still works after 300 years: all the clocks in the show are wound up, ticking and periodically chiming. Continue reading...","Thu, 28 Nov 2024 13:24:02 GMT",0.836,0.9756

These range from secluded, unspoilt coves with fine, white sand and crystal-clear waters to the more easily accessible and well-known beaches that tourists flock to every day. So where do you start?You’ll find the best introduction in Hua Hin and Koh Samui. Two very different destinations but both oozing with the charm and beach experience that you’d expect from Thailand. Once a quiet fishing village on the skinny stretch of mainland north of the Malay peninsula, Hua Hin was established as a royal getaway in the 1920s and has since grown into a fashionable resort town. While Koh Samui offers laidback island life with pristine beaches, tropical greenery and a calm blue sea.

I’m a size 18 and struggle to find nice clothes, but I noticed she was a similar size.” Barbara asked Andrea to lean over and look at the label on the coat, so she could find out where it was from. “She almost fell off her chair trying to see, so I decided to just go and ask,” says Barbara.

The Guardian,‘Gentlemen shared their tattoos over dinner’: how our taste for tattoos started with the rich,"Highly decorated skin is everywhere these days, but tattoos have a more elevated pedigree than you may think. A new book aims to make us think differently about Victorian aristocrats … and bank managersIn an age in which it appears impossible to walk down the high street every summer without being confronted by countless examples of inked flesh, you may be inclined to think that tattoos are no longer associated with the underground, or indeed the underclass. But the history of the practice is long and winding. A&nbsp;Vanity Fair account from 1926 is typical of many similar interventions both before and after: “Tattooing has passed from the savage to the sailor, from the sailor to the landsman. It has since percolated through the entire social stratum; tattooing has received its credentials, and may now be found beneath many a tailored shirt.”“There’s obviously a long, complicated and important history relating tattoos to sailors, and also to criminals and assorted ne’er do wells”, explains Matt Lodder, author of Tattoos: The Untold History of a Modern Art), a handsomely illustrated new book on the subject. “But the main reason, certainly in Britain, we have a tattooing industry is because rich people wanted to get tattooed. I&nbsp;wanted to explore that industry and how it developed, and especially look at the people involved in it who have, with varying degrees of success, made tattooing a serious and standardised professional practice.” Continue reading...","Thu, 28 Nov 2024 08:00:37 GMT",0.7184,0.8919

The Guardian,Assisted dying: a historic vote comes to parliament - podcast,"Deputy political editor Jessica Elgot explains how the assisted dying bill came to the House of Commons this week, and how MPs are feeling about their vote. Dr Lucy Thomas speaks about her experience in palliative care and her fears if MPs vote the bill throughOn Friday, MPs will vote on the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) bill – a once-in-a-generation vote on whether those with terminal illnesses should have the right to an assisted death. The right, in other words, to end one’s own life with the help of medical professionals.As the Guardian’s deputy political editor Jessica Elgot explains, it would be a monumental social change, and has been compared to previous reforms on abortion, the death penalty and equal marriage. Yet with just a day to go, it is not at all clear which way the vote will go. Indeed, Helen Pidd hears from MPs in parliament, some of whom are still unsure whether they will support or oppose the bill. Continue reading...","Thu, 28 Nov 2024 03:00:30 GMT",0.0,-0.9285

The Guardian,How having babies became so political - video,"The pronatalist movement in the US is gathering pace once again, rekindled by Silicon Valley personalities and hard-right conservatives who are becoming increasingly vocal about whether or not women are having enough babies. But it's not just in the US, some governments in other countries have launched marketing campaigns encouraging people to have more children, while others have offered financial incentives. But while many of these policies claim to be about halting population decline, there are other factors at play. Josh Toussaint-Strauss interrogates efforts around the world to boost birth rates, as well as the underlying political motivations, from bodily autonomy to immigrationBirthrates are plummeting worldwide.

The Guardian,Pride and protest: a photographic history of the fight for LGBTQ+ rights,"Images by Fred W McDarrah feature in a new exhibition that follows key moments of community and liberationThe Manhattan photographer Fred McDarrah came to prominence documenting the Beat movement that overtook Greenwich Village in the 1950s, capturing, among others, Jack Kerouac (who sat for a portrait in McDarrah’s apartment) and one of the earliest photos of a very young and unknown Bob Dylan. It was this portfolio that made his name at the Village Voice, where he would work for an astonishing 50 years, but toward the end of the 1960s McDarrah began to photograph an entirely new movement sweeping over the Village.In spring 1966 at Julius’s Bar, a short walk from the Stonewall Inn, four gay men – Dick Leitsch, Craig Rodwell, John Timmons and Randy Wicker – engaged in what they termed a “sip-in” in order to challenge a law that made it a prosecutable offense for one man to buy another a drink. It was one of the first salvos in the incipient gay rights movement, and McDarrah was there to see it, perfectly capturing the decisive moment when a bartender – collaborating with the group – placed his hand over the drinks and stated that it was against the law to serve the men. The image is a perfect distillation of the encounter, a moment when customer and bartender are exchanging deep, meaningful looks that say so much more than words.
