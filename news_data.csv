The Guardian,Humphrey’s world: how the Samuel Smith beer baron built Britain’s strangest pub chain,"Since the 1970s, Humphrey Smith has acquired scores of pubs and historic properties around the UK. But time after time, he has left the buildings empty. Why has he allowed his empire to moulder?In early September 2022, Alivia Bienko and her husband, Liam, were driving through Stamford Bridge, an idyllic village on the River Derwent, near York, when a shuttered pub caught their eye. Stuck to one of the windows was an A4 sheet advertising for a couple to live in and manage the pub. On the advert was a mobile number for Samuel Smith, the brewery that owned the pub. Founded in 1758, Samuel Smith Old Brewery is one of the largest family-owned brewery and pub operations in the UK. Bienko had experience in hospitality, and she and Liam were open to a change. They decided to look into the job.Online, they came across a few stories of couples who had been thrown out of their jobs running Samuel Smith’s pubs, largely for “missing money or missing beer”, Bienko said. Nothing unusual about that. But when the couple dialled the number on the advert, they were surprised to find themselves speaking to Humphrey Smith, the stupendously wealthy chairman of the company, who has been in charge since the 1970s. “He said, ‘I can come and meet you tomorrow’,” Bienko told me. “It was very odd and we were very nervous, because we were living in a small caravan and here was a millionaire coming to visit us.” Continue reading...","Thu, 19 Dec 2024 05:00:06 GMT",0.0,-0.7564

She is certainly in alien territory here, and plays Prospero with the steely-voiced conviction of a commander giving urgent instruction to an interstellar space crew at imminent risk of attack. She is making her West End debut in this late Shakespearean drama as its gender-reversed central sorcerer and usurped Duchess of Milan, and the remote isle of sounds and sweet airs which she sequesters appears to be floating in deep space.The dark hills and rubble on Soutra Gilmour’s set look lunar, the booms and bursts in the black background sound like explosions of interplanetary matter (the sound design and compositions are by Ben and Max Ringham) and the lights (designed by Jon Clark) look like the blazing beams of UFOs.

The Guardian,Liaison committee day. This was Keir Time. He’d dreamed of it for most of his life | John Crace,"Being asked about what he has been doing is Starmer’s idea of fun. There’s nothing he likes more than going on and on about himselfAn appearance before the liaison committee – the supergroup of select committee chairs – is usually something that strikes fear into any prime minister. Sleepless nights. Panic attacks. Boris Johnson was so phobic that he frequently binned his invitations to show up. Not that it did much good. He was only delaying the inevitable. The whining schoolboy, with his satchel and shining morning face, creeping like a snail unwillingly to school. Theresa May was just gnomic. Short elliptical sentences, signifying nothing. A face bathed in misery.Keir Starmer has been a refreshing change to all that. Not just accepting his lot. A necessary final 90-minute endurance act before he could pretty much knock off for Christmas. Instead, he actively sought an invitation. Sending out a reminder to the committee before it had even thought about a possible date. Pestering them to get their act together. He couldn’t wait a moment longer. Four-and-a-half years of being ignored as leader of the opposition had been more than enough. This was Keir Time.Taking the Lead by John Crace is published by Little, Brown (£18.99).

If you have any of them in your life, cut them out now. If they cannot understand the point of theatre, if they cannot see something amazing without wanting to dissect and destroy it, if they feel the need to point out that a woman cannot actually be sawn in half or a rabbit pulled from an ordinary top hat – well, they do not think much of you, my friend.So, then, to Miracles – a Christmas special showcasing the skills of the magician Steven Frayne (AKA Dynamo) as he travels up and down the country, entertaining people on the streets with astonishing card and other tricks.

I felt nervous, but was determined to make a good impression on Bridget’s parents, who lived in a remote rural&nbsp;community in the Scottish Borders – a part of the world that was very different from anything familiar to me.Having grown up in a Muslim family, I was unused to traditions such as Christmas dinner. I worried that requesting halal meat might interfere with her family’s food plans. Bridget’s parents, being deeply kind and empathetic people, suggested that perhaps I&nbsp;could prepare a Christmas curry for the family.

In March, an ombudsman judged that they deserved redress for communication failings, recommending compensation of between £1,000 and £2,950 each for maladministration.However, the government claims that this is not justified on the grounds that about 90% of these women did know the new retirement age.

The Guardian,"A string of assassinations, a faltering economy, a shortage of workers: the pressure on Putin is ratcheting up | Olga Chyzh","A vacuum among his generals is the last thing the president needs. He will be holding his breath for Trump’s inaugurationThe assassination on Tuesday of the Russian general and conspiracy theorist Igor Kirillov in downtown Moscow is yet another operation in a string of small, morale-boosting actions by Ukraine and its sympathisers. Last month, Valery Trankovsky, a senior naval officer, was killed in a car-bombing in Crimea. Sergei Yevsyukov, the former chief of the Russian-operated Olenivka prison that Russian forces blew up in 2022, killing many Ukrainian prisoners of war, died in a similar attack this month in Donetsk. All three men had been accused by Ukraine of war crimes.These killings are more than acts of retribution; they are part of a calculated effort to signal Ukraine’s resolve in the face of Russian aggression. They serve as a warning to Moscow’s military establishment and offer a modicum of justice to a Ukrainian public enraged by the atrocities committed by Russian forces. Yet the effectiveness of such assassinations is less clear. In authoritarian regimes that lack mechanisms for orderly power transitions, the elimination of high-ranking officials can destabilise leadership structures. A sudden vacuum at the top risks igniting infighting among elites and undermining the regime’s cohesion.Olga Chyzh researches political violence and repressive regimes, she is an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of TorontoDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Women’s body hair shouldn’t be controversial. It’s time to stop policing our physical choices | Nova Weetman,"We must preserve the rights of women to make decisions that have nothing to do with anyone elseGrowing up in the 1980s, all the teenage girls I knew shaved their legs and their armpits as soon as they could. I was 15 when I started. I borrowed one of Mum’s razors without her knowing and dry shaved my calves. I can still remember the beads of blood forming after I nicked the skin, and how surprised I was that the hair started growing back so quickly.Amazingly, I didn’t meet a woman with visible underarm hair until I was backpacking across Europe in my late teens. I stayed in youth hostels where everyone seemed more confident than me about getting changed in the dorms, and many of my fellow travellers were surprised that I still shaved.

The Guardian,"The Guardian view on the Pelicot rape trial: Merci, Gisèle, from women everywhere | Editorial","Gisèle Pelicot’s extraordinary courage and composure has forced a reckoning in France and elsewhere. We must act on her demand for changeGisèle Pelicot, a 72-year-old woman who had retired to a small village in provincial France, has become a heroine not only to compatriots but to people thousands of miles away, rightly saluted by global leaders and ordinary citizens alike. In refusing anonymity, and insisting that the trial of her ex-husband and other men for raping her be held in public, she has forced a broader recognition that “shame must change sides”. Her extraordinary courage and composure shone through the grim hearings.For almost 10 years, Mrs Pelicot’s husband of decades drugged and raped her, and sedated her so that dozens of others could rape her at his instigation. Dominique&nbsp;Pelicot was caught by chance after a security guard caught him filming up women’s skirts at a supermarket, prompting police to seize his computer equipment. But he has since admitted an attempted rape in 1999, after police matched his DNA to a sample from the scene, and is under investigation for a 1991 rape and murder that has similarities with that incident. He denies involvement.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Britain and its constitution: a country we should know better | Editorial,"A new survey shows that the UK has a far more exhaustive written version of its laws and principles than many thinkIt is often said that Britain has no written constitution. The lack of one is sometimes invoked by critics to attack – and occasionally by defenders to justify – the archaisms, anomalies and other mysteries that abound in the practices of the British state. No less an authority than Queen Elizabeth II said that the constitution “has always been puzzling and always will be”. The reality, however, is more straightforward, but also more subtle.Constitutions, wrote the political scientist Anthony&nbsp;King, “are never – repeat, never – written down in their entirety”. Even the much-vaunted United States constitution, for example, contains no provision about the electoral system. Nor does the French one. A capital&nbsp;C is not a precondition for a constitution.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,There’s little evidence of a ‘brain microbiome’ | Letter,"Prof Mark Pallen, Dr Aimee Parker, Prof Nick Loman and Prof Alan Walker take issue with an article that discussed the existence of a brain microbiome and its impact on diseasesContrary to what is implied in your article (The brain microbiome: could understanding it help prevent dementia?, 1 December), the weight of expert opinion in medical microbiology rejects the existence of a “brain microbiome” in the sense of a resident microbial community in healthy human brains. While pathogenic microbes – such as Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease, or fungal pathogens like Cryptococcus neoformans – can invade the brain and cause neurological symptoms, these are examples of infections, not evidence of a native&nbsp;microbial&nbsp;community.Similarly, cognitive benefits of vaccines can be explained by their role in preventing infections or modulating immune responses and inflammation, rather than any impact on a “brain microbiome”. Furthermore, the studies cited in the article have not undergone independent validation, nor do they provide any kind of consistent picture. This mirrors controversies around other supposed microbiomes – such as that of the placenta – which have failed to withstand independent scrutiny. Over a decade of research indicates that contamination, typically from laboratory reagents, is the most plausible explanation for such findings, particularly when even supposedly ultrapure water has been shown to harbour DNA signatures and culturable microbes.

But we shouldn’t delude ourselves that political leadership alone is enough to shift the dial on many of these generational challenges.While I have critiqued the detail of Whitehall reforms announced by Labour this winter, most of us who have worked in or with Whitehall would accept the need for these institutions to work differently.

Regardless of Manchester City’s extended wobble, a result at home to Pep Guardiola’s side will go a long way to providing an indication. It was always going to be a big ask for Villa to better or even equal last season’s achievements but, with automatic qualification to the Champions League last 16 a distinct possibility and a top-four finish within reach, it has been another solid, if imperfect, start. Only once this season have Villa recorded victory after a European night, in September after winning at Young Boys.

You have to respect that. But something is telling me that Usyk is going to do it again. Usyk just has luck on his side and he has skills. He has the backing of his people and is fighting for his country.”Usyk beat Dubois in August 2023 when he stopped his young British challenger in the ninth round of a bruising contest. But he was hurt by Dubois in round five and slumped to the canvas after a punch on the beltline was ruled as a low blow. Usyk was given four minutes to recover before, drawing on his vast experience and reserves of will, he eventually battered Dubois into submission.

When the drizzly season hits, it’s the weatherproof saviour that makes leaving the house just about bearable. Beyond practicalities, though, it’s also an important style choice. As the top layer of every outfit, it’s the piece of clothing everyone sees first, so you need to make it count.There’s much to consider when hitting the shops for a new piece of outerwear.

The Guardian,The 8 best sustainable British cheeses to garnish your Christmas cheese board,"From soft, buttery cheddar to crumbly caerphilly, here’s our pick of cheeses that will benefit you, the animal and the environmentThe fruity tang of a strong cheddar; the creamy ooze of a brie; the honk of a blue so ripe it threatens to walk off the board. To cheese lovers, these are as much a part of this season’s sensory joys as mince pies and a Christmas tree glowing with lights.Yet they can come at an environmental price. Sustainability is frustratingly complicated for those of us who want to lay on a cheeseboard without guilt this Christmas. Most of us now know about livestock emissions, global deforestation in the name of producing feed, and the pollution – via agricultural runoff – of local waterways. A few years ago, we were told being sustainable meant avoiding dairy completely; then we learned about the benefits ruminants can bring to the soil when farmed regeneratively.The cheddar:

The Guardian,‘It’s all starting to get very emotional’: how Gavin & Stacey became one of TV’s most beloved comedies,"It’s back this Christmas … for the final time. But how did the naughty, surreal sitcom charm Britain so much that new episodes are a national event with viewing figures akin to a royal wedding?The last time Gavin &amp; Stacey was the centrepiece of the Christmas schedules, in 2019, 11.6 million people watched it, then annoyed each other for the rest of the night by shouting “Oh” and “What’s occurin’” in accents so far from Barry that search parties were sent out to find them. By the time catchup and streaming figures were included, that figure had grown to 17.1 million. Getting so many people to agree to watch anything together is now a feat so rare it’s usually reserved for football, royal weddings and lockdown announcements. But somehow, a comedy about a normal couple from different parts of the UK, and their slightly less ordinary family and friends, has become a momentous national occasion.The last Christmas special bowed out with a cliffhanger, as Nessa told Smithy “I loves you, with all my heart,” then went down on one knee and proposed. Smithy’s shocked face, followed by a brutal cut to the credits, left everyone hanging. Now, five years later, at 9pm on Christmas Day, we will find out what he said. According to its writers and stars Ruth Jones and James Corden, this hour-and-a-half special really will be the last ever episode. In May, Corden shared a black-and-white photograph of him and Jones holding up the script, with “The Finale” very clearly right there in the title. (If that isn’t enough proof, on New Year’s Day BBC One is showing a documentary called A Fond Farewell, another title it will be hard to walk back.) “It’s all starting to get very emotional,” said Corden at the start of December.

When her song Pretty Girl went viral in late 2017, she was still in her first year of college.Two years later, her debut album, Immunity, was widely praised for its maturity and poise, with Cottrill writing and producing all the tracks (with input from Vampire Weekend founding member Rostam Batmanglij). The follow-up, Sling (made with Jack Antonoff), was equally self-assured as Cottrill reflected on her mixed experiences of the music industry and sudden fame.

The Guardian,The 50 best TV shows of 2024: No 3 – One Day,"A word of mouth phenomenon thanks to pitch-perfect turns by Leo Woodall and Ambika Mod, the David Nicholls romance provided joy, tears and 90s nostalgia galore• The 50 best TV shows of 2024• More on the best culture of 2024Our cultural landscape is filled with sequels, remakes and attempts to squeeze every last drop out of established IP. So the prospect of a TV series based on David Nicholls’ 2009 weepy romance One Day was not the most exciting prospect. Not least because the novel had already been adapted for the screen, starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess in 2011, and had been met with decidedly mixed reviews.But Netflix’s witty and heartstoppingly romantic series proved to be one of the year’s best and most moving shows. In lesser hands, the format could have come across as gimmicky – given its charting of two decades of the relationship of privileged cad Dexter (Leo Woodall) and working-class artistically inclined Emma (a star-making turn from the delightful Ambika Mod), with each episode set a year apart on 15 July, starting in 1988 when the two met at the University of Edinburgh. But with the team behind it including Nicholls and Three Girls’ Nicole Taylor, the material was handled with such care that the frequent needle drops on hits by the Verve, N-Trance and Cornershop – and even the more brazen nods to nostalgia (80s puffed sleeves, chunky Nokias, phone booths being used as more than public toilets) – came across as artful, joyous time stamping. Mod and Woodall’s performances were pitch-perfect and their rare chemistry had you hoping for a happily-ever-after every step of the way. Word of mouth spread like wildfire, and despite not having the star power of many Netflix properties, it became the most watched series on the platform the week after its release.

Occasionally, I even feel pretty. So it’s hard not to be convinced, when I see a photograph of myself, that I am under a horrible illusion of being happily average-looking and am actually pretty hideous. This is made even worse when I see a photo as being terribly unflattering and others say it’s nice! I am aware this is quite superficial, but it makes me really upset. Which is the truth here?

Now it’s to close, leaving devoted customers bereftThe premise of Old Town clothing was a simple one: choose from a limited range of designs and fabrics (cotton drill, canvas, linen or cord), provide your measurements and, a few weeks later, a box would arrive through the post containing your trousers, jacket or skirt, handmade in Norfolk by designer Will Brown, Marie Willey and their team of 10 seamstresses. But this year Old Town announced they are not taking any further orders and is winding down the main business – news greeted with anguish among their regular clients, including myself.“We’re 68, we are tired,” Willey says. “We made a rod for our own backs because we’ve micromanaged things to the point it’s worn us out.” Each had clearly defined roles – Willey dealing with customers and ordering fabric, Brown the designing and making. In fact, he was the only person who knew how to operate the buttonhole sewing machine so he did them all himself, for years. Continue reading...","Thu, 19 Dec 2024 07:00:08 GMT",0.5106,0.6124

She discusses the trauma she has lived through – and why she still has faith in the futureWhy does anyone go on I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!? Sometimes there’s an obvious reputation-washing agenda, which annoyingly seems to work – people who are really hated come out more popular (Matt Hancock, for example). Other times it looks as if they need the money. For Tulisa, born Tula Paulinea Contostavlos 36 years ago in north London, her recent stint sounds more like aversion therapy. “I had a lot of fear surrounding exposure,” she says, “and I got to the point where I thought: ‘Am I holding on to this fear because of what people have done to me in the past? Am I letting other people change my perception of what my career is and could be?’ I didn’t want to feel that way any more.”It wasn’t really about winning (she got voted off in week three) and, as for the rest, the result was inconclusive. She didn’t stick around to watch the winner crowned, as is customary, but flew home from Australia early, overwhelmed. “I came out, still followed by cameras, all tits and teeth, and it wasn’t until I was on my own that I felt this introvert-overload. I was hyperventilating, crying. It was too much.” She was never able to determine, “Is this about a fear I have of being in the spotlight?
