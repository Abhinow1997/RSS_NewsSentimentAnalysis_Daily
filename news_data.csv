The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Putin admits situation ‘very difficult’ in Kursk as Kyiv forces mount new offensive,"Moscow shows ‘indifference’ to civilian humanitarian corridor offer, says Zelenskyy; France delivers Mirage jets. What we know on day 1,080Russia said it was battling a new Ukrainian offensive in Kursk, as Kyiv offered a humanitarian corridor for civilians in the Russian region it has invaded and partly occupied, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, admitted the situation there was “very difficult” as he met with regional governors. The Russian defence ministry said Ukraine deployed two mechanised battalions, tanks and armoured vehicles about 10 kilometres (six miles) from the border to the south-east of the Ukrainian-controlled town of Sudzha. There was no comment on the fresh offensive from officials in Kyiv, and Russian statements on the extent of any fighting could not be verified.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Thursday praised his troops for the Kursk offensive and issued several army units with state honours. “The occupier can and should be beaten on its territory. The Kursk operation clearly explains the meaning of the principle of ‘peace through strength’.”Zelenskyy’s office accused Moscow of “indifference” to the fate of its own citizens. “We are ready to open a humanitarian corridor from Kursk region to the depths of Russia in response to an official request of the Russian Federation. Apparently, the Russians do not want such a humanitarian corridor, because we have not received a corresponding request from them.” The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov claimed Russia was doing “everything” it could for Russian civilians in Kursk; however Moscow refused to comment publicly on the idea of a humanitarian corridor.Ukraine said on Thursday it had received a first batch of French Mirage 2000 fighter jets as well as F-16 fighters from the Netherlands. The numbers are classified but the Mirages are thought to number around six, while overall the Netherlands has promised to deliver Ukraine a total of 24 F-16s, in addition to the jets it supplies to a training centre for Ukrainian pilots and crew in Romania. French officials said the Mirages, originally conceived for air-to-air dogfights, had been adapted to enable air-to-ground strikes.Ukrainian forces struck an airfield in southern Russia that was being used to launch Shahed drones, Ukraine’s general staff said on Thursday. The night-time attack on the Primorsko-Akhtarsk airfield in Russia’s Krasnodar region started a fire, the general staff wrote on Facebook. Videos that were claimed to show the fire were posted online. It was not possible to independently verify the claims. The Russian defence ministry reported shooting down Ukrainian drones over Krasnodar – it frequently says drones were shot down when in fact there has been a successful attack by Ukraine.Volodymyr Zelenskyy will lead Ukraine’s delegation at the Munich security conference next week, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said on Thursday. The US vice-president, JD Vance, and Donald Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, are also expected to attend. Yermak said the Ukrainian delegation would present the country’s position on ending the war and their views on how “a long and lasting peace” can be achieved. 
 “It’s necessary that the leaders and the experts in politics who will be in Munich realise that this is momentum – that we are very near to really ending this war by a just and lasting peace, but [it’s] necessary to be together … Not to give Russia an opportunity to divide the world, to divide partners.”During his election campaign, Trump promised to end the fighting within 24 hours of taking office – revising that after he was elected to within six months. However, it is unclear how a ceasefire deal would take shape with Russia and Ukraine remaining far apart on terms. Ukrainians would provide Kellogg with “full and real information” about the situation on the battlefield, ongoing mobilisation efforts, and the status of weapons and equipment delivery, Yermak said. “I think it’s important that we go through these consultations and negotiations before the [Trump] administration has any plans,” he said. “Because our position is that it’s impossible to have, and will be a big mistake to have, any plans without participation by Ukraine in preparing this plan.”Slovakia’s gas transit company SPP said on Thursday it had started getting gas from Russia via Turkey after Ukraine halted Russian flows via its territory. “They are conducted by the southern route through TurkStream and via Hungary to Slovakia,” said SPP spokesman Ondrej Sebesta. TurkStream runs for 930km (580 miles) under the Black Sea from the Russian resort city of Anapa to Kiyikoy in north-western Turkey, then connects to overground pipelines that run up through the Balkans to Europe, supplying EU member Hungary, Slovakia’s southern neighbour.

Now scientists have weighed in on the perfect way to boil an egg, and the results are egg-stremely tasty.From a materials perspective, cooking an egg within its shell is more complicated than it might at first seem.

It’s almost impossible to believe any of the bragging, soundbite-spewing chancers are even good at businessThe opening scenes of The Apprentice – Lord Alan Sugar’s search for a new business partner – have become a yearly tradition on British TV. We meet a squad of suited and bodycon business dress-clad candidates, who seem to be competing to say the most ridiculous thing. “I’m like a lion in the business world. Fierce, hungry and ready to devour my prey,” says Chisola Chitambala, a contestant on the latest series, which is airing weekly on BBC One. “The level of competitiveness I have is disgusting! I am the human equivalent of a tank. Nothing gets in my way,” insists meal-prep entrepreneur Mia Collins. “I can sleep when I’m dead!” proclaims Amber-Rose Badrudin, while hair-transplant consultant Carlo Brancati boasts: “What others can earn in a month takes me one hour.” (This gives rise to the question: what are you doing here, then?)The first series of The Apprentice premiered 20 years ago this month on BBC Two. The days when it felt like a genuinely exciting format are long gone, however, because it is now one of the most predictable shows on TV. Ratings have stalled, it’s being panned by critics and it has grown into a high-cringe spectacle – one that symbolises a wider slide in standards in reality TV and beyond.

Although Austen’s stories will remain the same, the covers of these editions feature cartoonish illustrations of the characters, and are being marketed as “full of meet-cutes, missed connections and drama”.

VerulamiumParkRangerI knew Dennis Hopper as the actor in Easy Rider, Apocalypse Now and Rebel Without a Cause, and that he stood for the counterculture, but I’d never done a deep dive. Ten years ago I saw his photos at the Royal Academy and realised he was also a brilliant photographer; I started reading biographies and checking out the movies I’d missed. Then I wrote a fun song about him called Dennis Hopper where every line rhymed with Hopper. I thought it would be great to do an EP, because his life was so colourful, but after some of my band members secretly recorded some instrumentals and suggested I put lyrics to them, I realised it could be an album of his life.I started just before the pandemic but had all these other albums and box set projects, so I’d work intensely on Hopper then leave it and return with fresh ears. It has 25 songs. A friend of mine suggested I was doing too many voices myself – an American commentator, an old hippy and so on – and needed some guests. I used to love those Bruce Springsteen bootlegs where he’d do these incredible narratives at the end of the songs and thought, “If we could only get Bruce … ” He had come to a Waterboys gig in Dublin 10 years ago so there was a connection, and our manager asked his. Bruce did three takes for the song Ten Years Gone and sent all three. I got to pick between them. He did it so brilliantly and brought all the drama that I’d hoped he would.

The Guardian,"‘We water, rest, water’: the green belt of vegetable plots cooling a city","A green belt circling the capital of Burkina Faso is preparing the country for the climate crisisAs far as the eye can see is a hodge-podge of trees, vegetable plots and water tanks. Up close it may look like a gigantic allotment, but this unusual project actually stretches for 2,000 hectares (4,942 acres), a green belt that now completely rings the city of Ouagadougou.The green belt began life many years ago in the 1970s, with the aim of building a protective wall against the encroaching desert that lies beyond the greenery, just a few steps away. In Burkina Faso, one-third of the territory – about 9 million hectares of productive land – is degraded, with an estimated average degradation rate of 360,000 hectares per year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). “Burkina Faso is not a climatically favoured country, but the drought of the 1980s exacerbated the problem, leading to significant population movements toward less degraded areas,” explains Sidnoma Abdoul Aziz Traoré, an environmental economist and expert in land degradation at the Centre Universitaire de Ziniaré (CUZ).

That was always a mistake: aspiring autocrats are most dangerous when they come to power a second time. But even those bracing for shocks could hardly have expected Trump to be so blatantly lawless and destructive once back in office. This approach – sabotage bureaucracies, violate the constitution, then see what happens – might now be applied to education.Trump’s choice of education secretary, pro-wrestling billionaire Linda McMahon, seemed positively harmless compared with figures like the walking talking threat to public health known as Robert F Kennedy Jr. Though she has an accusation of having enabled the sexual abuse of young boys in the wrestling world hanging over her, McMahon denies all wrongdoing.

The Guardian,"I don’t know if Lucy Letby's convictions will be upheld, but I know we all have a stake in the outcome | Gaby Hinsliff","This is not just about one terrible set of allegations. Health, the law, checks and balances: it is testing public confidence in everything Beyond reasonable doubt. Those words carry a heavy moral burden, and so they should. Jurors hold another human being’s life in their hands, and must be convinced there is no other rational explanation for the facts presented to them than the defendant’s guilt. But what happens when those facts start to shimmer and blur, to multiply and divide confusingly before your eyes?Lucy Letby is officially Britain’s worst serial child killer, serving 15 life sentences for murdering seven babies and trying to kill seven more. But her case has become as troubling to some medical professionals as it is attractive to conspiracy theorists because of the stubbornly persistent doubts at its heart. There are things we may never know for sure about those babies’ last moments.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Thu, 06 Feb 2025 18:31:09 GMT",0.0,-0.9911
The Guardian,Who will show Trump and Netanyahu that they're not above the law? It has to be Europe | Steve Crawshaw,"The US president is quick to roll out the red carpet for an ally wanted for war crimes. Now Europe must stop placating themDonald Trump’s proposal to evict 2 million Palestinians from Gaza is an unashamed declaration of support for ethnic cleansing. As so often, he seems ready to ignore moral and legal codes alike. “Deportation or forcible transfer of population” is listed in the Rome statute of the international criminal court as a crime against humanity. And yet a US president has put that idea on the table. Trump insists this would be in everybody’s interest. According to him, Palestinians would not want to return to their homes. “I have heard that Gaza has been very unlucky for them,” he recently said. The population is, in Trump’s words, “living in hell”, with “death and destruction and rubble and demolished buildings falling all over”. He made no mention of Israel’s responsibility for that death and destruction and rubble.More than 30 years ago, during the early months of the bloody Bosnian war that I had been reporting on as the eastern Europe editor of the Independent, the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadžić, explained to me that the ethnic cleansing of the Muslim population that was then under way was, in fact, doing the Bosnians a favour. “We let them go,” Karadžić explained with a smile, “with their luggage and everything.” Like Karadžić, Trump does not hide the fact that Palestinians who are forced to abandon their homes would have no choice in the matter. Sitting next to Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump suggested: “I don’t think they’re going to tell me no.”Steve Crawshaw is author of Prosecuting the Powerful: War Crimes and the Battle for JusticeDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The idea of ‘welfare’ has lost all meaning. Just look at the cruel state of women’s prisons | Zoe Williams,"A new report says there’s a ‘basic lack of decency’ in England’s jails. It’s a motif repeated across a nation stripped to the boneOne of the fundamentals of modern jail craft is the idea that it’s hard to convince prisoners that you care about their welfare if they’re living in squalid conditions. This has been understood for years, with fluctuating amounts of buy-in from politicians about how important it was to offender management that inmates felt cared about.Self-harm, meanwhile, has long been an issue of concern. I remember, in the 1990s and 2000s, detailed conversations with prison psychologists about why women’s prisons had disproportionate amounts of it: one idea, which I always found the most convincing, was that women, where they had children, were almost always the main carer, so were in a state of constant anxiety about who was looking after them. Another theory was that psychological interventions such as anger management courses had been devised for male prisoners; women responded differently to the discovery that they could have controlled their anger – by blaming themselves. That was also plausible.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

The Guardian,Grim news for Rachel Reeves is good news for the FTSE 100 | Nils Pratley,"The stock market is not the economy – as shown by the new closing high after the Bank of England’s rates cutNever confuse a stock market index with a symbol of national economic health. The truth of that old piece of wisdom was demonstrated on Thursday as the FTSE 100 went on a rip-roaring run – up 104 points, or 1.2%, to a new closing high of 8,727 – while the Bank of England cut interest rates because the UK economy was flat on its back.The point always to remember about the Footsie is that its constituents are an international crew, or at least they operate internationally. Goldman Sachs’ analysts calculated recently that, in aggregate, only 22% of the revenues of FTSE 100 companies were generated in the UK. North America, at 29%, and the Asia-Pacific region, at 23%, are more important. Think of the likes of index heavyweights AstraZeneca, BP, GSK and Shell: their UK revenue exposures are measured in low single-digit percentages.

The Guardian,What will Trump 2.0 mean for the global world order? | Stephen Wertheim,"If the administration is embracing a multipolar world, does that mean the end of American primacy?Many assumed that Donald Trump’s second term as president of the United States would turn out like his first. But this time looks to be different. In his opening weeks, the US president has taken a flurry of actions he never attempted before, wielding sweeping tariffs against the US’s neighbors, upending portions of the federal workforce, and attempting to change constitutionally enshrined citizenship laws through executive order.The early signs on foreign policy are no exception. In his inaugural address, Trump said next to nothing about the issues that have dominated US foreign policy for decades – matters of war and peace in Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Instead, he spoke of expanding US territory in the western hemisphere (and going to Mars), harking back explicitly to the 19th-century tradition of manifest destiny. Astoundingly, Trump mentioned China solely for the purpose of accusing it, inaccurately, of operating the Panama canal. When he turned beyond the Americas, Trump’s most telling line signaled restraint: “We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end – and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.” Continue reading...","Thu, 06 Feb 2025 14:00:15 GMT",0.0,0.5565

But there is too much gloss, when so many people are still sufferingNow she’s an opera. Yet another myth-making apotheosis lifts Margaret Thatcher to iconic realms, crafting for her an image recalling Elizabeth I.

This week saw James Graham’s Brian and Maggie drama about an interview that helped tip her towards her downfall. Next week, Radio 4 brings us When Larry met Maggie, Tim Walker’s play imagining scenes when Laurence Olivier coached the ingenue education secretary in the art of wooing and even seducing audiences.This week marks the 50th anniversary of Thatcher’s election as leader of her party.

The Guardian,"The Guardian view on Sudan’s war: borders can’t contain a devastating, destabilising crisis | Editorial","The rest of the world has largely ignored the horror of this conflict, but will find its effects ripple outwardsAs Sudan approaches its third year of civil war, the dynamics are suddenly shifting. Sudan’s military, which launched a major offensive against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in September, made&nbsp;swift progress in Gezira state, and in recent days&nbsp;has abruptly and unexpectedly regained ground&nbsp;in Khartoum.Whether it has truly turned the tide – as key backers appear to believe – has yet to be seen. Even if the capital can be fully retaken and secured, reconstructing the devastated city would be an immense task. The RSF might well entrench themselves elsewhere; this may further spur their ferocity in the western region of Darfur. Meaningful negotiations between the warring parties look even more distant. There is still less prospect of a return to civilian politics, overthrown in a coup by the partnership of the army chief, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF leader, Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo – known as Hemedti – before they turned on each other.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They were asked to give evidence of the development, implementation and practice of VAD in their respective states, which they did.They gave the committee facts, not faith; experience, not opinion. Any “evangelising” would have been for those at the end of life to have the choice to die with dignity at a time of their choosing.

The Guardian,Mahler: Symphony No7 album review – sheer brilliance: this is one of the finest Mahler 7’s on disc,"Bavarian Radio SO/Rattle(BR Klassik)Simon Rattle and the BRSO’s account of Mahler’s tricky seventh symphony is direct and vivid.Though it was launched without a great deal of fanfare, five years before he took over as the Bavarian Radio Symphony’s chief conductor, Simon Rattle’s Mahler series with the Munich-based orchestra was already promising to be one of the most significant additions to the composer’s discography in recent years. Rattle’s accounts of Das Lied von der Erde and the Sixth and Ninth Symphonies have already appeared, all of them taken from performances in the Isarphilharmonie im Gasteig in Munich, and the new version of the Seventh was recorded there last November.When complete, this will be Rattle’s second Mahler survey, following his cycle with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in the 1980s and 90s (he went on to rerecord some of the symphonies with the Berliner Philharmoniker too, but not all of them). Inevitably, there are distinct differences in his approach to the Seventh across the 30-odd years that separate the Birmingham and Munich versions, as well as between this latest one and a live recording that was included in a composite box of the Mahler symphonies issued by the Berlin Philharmonic four years ago.

But they’re right. The older I get, the more I know it. When I was 20, I could sleep anywhere: a friend’s floor, a filthy sofa – even a phone box one night. These days I won’t get a single one of 40 winks if I’m not lying on a decent mattress. Comfy but firm, cosy but breathable, and with loads of cool spots for my feet.Today’s best mattresses promise all this and more. Gone are the days when your biggest decision was between a sprung double or a sprung king size. Pocket springs are still around, but they face stiff – well, medium firm – competition from hybrid mattresses that combine springs and memory foam to provide that all-important balance of comfort and support.Best overall mattress:

The Guardian,The food filter: which supermarket has the best extra-virgin olive oil?,"From luxury Sicilian to budget buys, our Rome correspondent tests supermarket extra-virgin olive oils – and reveals how much you should spend • The best hot sauces, tasted and rated by Thomasina MiersYears ago, a good cook, who happened to be Greek, told me to think of olive oil not simply as liquid fat, but as an essential ingredient, as flavour and as a seasoning, with the ability to act like herbs and spices. He’s absolutely right and his excellent advice continues to motivate me when I’m choosing extra-virgin olive oil, which is the single most important ingredient I buy, and my biggest expense in the kitchen. While I do have the odd special bottle for drizzling, I am more interested in a good-tasting all-rounder that I can use for everything (my cooking is largely vegetable-, pasta-, pulse-, cheese- and egg-centric), including deep-frying (in a very small pan).Just to recap, olive oil is the liquid fat obtained by pressing olives, which are fruits. Once picked, they need to be processed as soon as possible – that is, crushed, then centrifugally spun to separate the pulp, water and oil, all in scrupulously clean machinery and at a steady temperature, which preserves the natural aromas of the olives. It takes about eight kilos of olives to make a litre of oil, which, to be considered extra-virgin olive oil, needs to have no defects and no more than 0.8% of free fatty acids. And that comes at a price: expect to pay between £14 and £18 a litre. Continue reading...","Sat, 01 Feb 2025 10:00:39 GMT",0.6369,0.9847

In these fancier coffee spots, everyone’s dependable, unfussy go-to is being eclipsed by a newer import from Australia and New Zealand: the long black.Conducting an unofficial survey of coffee spots, I noticed nearly every barista had a slightly different explanation of the drink. “It’s basically exactly the same as an americano,” one whispered conspiratorially. “It’s a shorter black coffee, the same size as a flat white,” explained another.

I could have one man say: [falsetto] ‘We’re going to tax you 25%.’ And I could say another: ‘Listen, you motherfuckers, we’re going to tax you 25%!’”“We’re a debtor nation. Something’s going to happen over the next number of years in this country, because you can’t keep on losing $200bn … and yet we let Japan come in and dump everything right into our markets. It’s not free trade. If you ever go to Japan right now and try to sell something, forget about it, Oprah. Just forget about it. It’s almost impossible. They don’t have laws against it. They just make it impossible. They come over here, they sell their cars, their VCRs, they knock the hell out of our companies.” Continue reading...","Thu, 06 Feb 2025 05:00:04 GMT",0.0,-0.9594
The Guardian,‘He wanted to have a wing of the Tate named after him’: remembering the groundbreaking art of Donald Rodney,"A new show celebrates the pioneering, polemical artist who inspired a generation of Black British creatives – and whose works are as relevant today as they’ve ever beenFor many reasons, 1981 stands as a landmark year in Black British history. That January, the New Cross Fire claimed the lives of 13 young Black people. Amid widespread suspicion that the fire had been a targeted attack by violent racists, the police concluded otherwise after a lacklustre investigation. In April came the Brixton uprising, which resulted in 279 injuries to police and £7.5m worth of damage to the area’s buildings and vehicles. While the subsequent Scarman Report acknowledged some of the hardships facing people of colour, it emphatically denied the existence of institutional racism in Britain – no surprise perhaps given Thatcher had swept to victory a couple of years previously on the back of a wave of anti-immigration sentiment.It was against this tumultuous backdrop that Donald Rodney – born to Jamaican parents and raised in Smethwick, West Midlands (a hotbed of racial tensions in the 1960s)– entered art school at Trent Polytechnic in Nottingham. “When I joined in 1980 there were no other Black students but the year after there were three or four including Donald,” says Rodney’s friend and collaborator Keith Piper. Piper, himself a young Black artist who had already begun exhibiting politically charged work, swiftly formed an alliance with Rodney. “In a sense, he was the most unlikely to pick up those ideas and run with them because he was so flamboyant,” says Piper. “He was every inch the artist – very humorous but incredibly sophisticated in his connection to contemporary art.” Looking back, Piper says it was striking how early Rodney was proselytising the genius of Basquiat and he was fascinated with how his neo-expressionist techniques might be used to make more explicitly political art.

The Guardian,500lb black bear survives LA wildfires hiding under house – video,"For those lucky enough to have a place to return to in Altadena, going home meant dealing with unfinished chores left behind when the Eaton fire forced them to evacuate. For Samy Arbid, who had moved into a property just a block from the fire line in November, there was a different kind of challenge: a 525lb (240kg) black bear. It had moved into the crawl space under the house before the fire and was still sheltering there when Arbid and his wife returned. The California wildfire department stepped in to help, luring the bear out with treats after deciding it was too big to tranquillise. The bear's new home is much more appropriate: the Angeles national forest Continue reading...","Wed, 05 Feb 2025 22:20:28 GMT",-0.296,-0.7645
