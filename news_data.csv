Fire officials have warned that given the severe damage to the aircraft, the number of casualties could rise.Jeju Air flight 2216 from Bangkok to Muan was carrying 181 people – 175 passengers and six crew – when it came down, skidded along the runway and hit fencing and a wall around the perimeter before catching fire.Rescues are underway, with two people brought out of the wreckage so far. Emergency services are continuing their search operation.The Boeing 737-800 may have suffered a bird strike that caused the landing gear to fail, according news agency Yonhap. The flight had reportedly attempted one landing before being forced to “go-around” when the landing gear failed to lower normally.South Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, has ordered “all available equipment and personnel to be mobilised” for the rescue operations at Muan international airport in the country’s south-west and is heading to the crash site, about 300km from the capital, Seoul.The pilot of Jeju Air flight 2216 from Bangkok appeared to be attempting a belly landing after the plane’s landing gear failed to deploy properly, Yonhap is reporting.

Their older children, six and eight, go to the village school and Jenna, a special needs teacher, is nursing their youngest at home. “We fell in love with the house, because every window has such a lovely view.

The Guardian,We all love TV show The Traitors … what does that say about us?,"As the scheming show returns for a third series, its appeal to millions worldwide suggests everyone has a wicked sideFor the benefit of the uninitiated, The Traitors is a BBC One game show involving 22 players, classed as either Traitors or Faithfuls. Staged at a Scottish castle (Ardross Castle in the Highlands, north of Inverness), it features a group of selected Traitors who must “murder” the Faithful, while the Faithful identify and banish Traitors. If a Traitor evades detection and makes it to the end, they swipe the entire prize pot, totalling as much as £120k.So, yes, it’s a gameshow, but, as those in thrall to the cloaked global entertainment franchise could tell you, it’s also so much more than that. It’s a dark and terrible dance of back-stabbing and scheming. It’s the pungent base notes of human nature. It’s the cynical celebration of deceit as a life skill. It’s “Let’s turn calculated personal betrayal into a gameshow!”. Indeed, what does the full-hearted embrace of The Traitors say about the modern British psyche, and are we ready to hear it?

The Guardian,"‘All people could do was hope the nerds would fix it’: the global panic over the millennium bug, 25 years on","Planes were going to drop out of the sky, nuclear reactors would explode. But then … nothing. What really happened with Y2K? People still disagree …Just before midnight on New Year’s Eve, 25 years ago, Queen Elizabeth II stepped off a private barge to arrive at London’s Millennium Dome for its grand opening ceremony. Dressed in a pumpkin-orange coat, she entered the venue with Prince Philip, taking her place alongside Tony and Cherie Blair and 12,000 guests to celebrate the dawn of a new millennium. At the stroke of midnight, Big Ben began to chime and 40 tonnes of fireworks were launched from 16 barges lined along the river. The crowd joined hands, preparing to sing Auld Lang Syne. For a few long moments, the Queen was neglected – she flapped her arms out like a toddler wanting to be lifted up, before Blair and Philip noticed her, took a hand each, and the singing began. A new century was born.One politician who wasn’t in attendance at the glitzy celebration was Paddy Tipping, a Labour MP who spent the night in the Cabinet Office. Tipping was minister for the millennium bug. After 25 years, it might be hard to recall just how big a deal the bug – now more commonly called Y2K – felt then. But for the last few years of the 90s, the idea that computers would fail catastrophically as the clock ticked over into the year 2000 was near the top of the political agenda in the UK and the US. Here was a hi-tech threat people feared might topple social order, underlining humanity’s new dependence on technological systems most of us did not understand. Though there are no precise figures, it’s estimated that the cost of the global effort to prevent Y2K exceeded £300bn (£633bn today, accounting for inflation).

The Guardian,"How will AI reshape the world? Well, it could be the spreadsheet of the 21st century | John Naughton","Large language models have changed how big corporations function, and the arrival of AI ‘agents’ – essentially automated Moneypennys – could prove irresistibleIf 2024 was the year of large language models (LLMs), then 2025 looks like the year of AI “agents”. These are quasi-intelligent systems that harness LLMs to go beyond their usual tricks of generating plausible text or responding to prompts. The idea is that an agent can be given a high-level – possibly even vague – goal and break it down into a series of actionable steps. Once it “understands” the goal, it can devise a plan to achieve it, much as a human would.OpenAI’s chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, recently explained it thus to the Financial Times: “It could be a researcher, a helpful assistant for everyday people, working moms like me.

Ideal for dictators, autocrats, strongmen, neo-Stalinists, far-right nationalist-populists or just students of geopolitics, it’s fanatical fun for all the family!Under conventional fantasy football rules, imaginary teams are composed of real-life players from the Premier League.

The Guardian,Sheffield’s museums show how art comes to life when it is connected to place | Rowan Moore,"Institutions in and around the city combine great works with humdrum relics of local life, to fantastic effectI’ve been living partly in Sheffield for the past month or so, which has given me the chance to catch up on some of the great monuments of industry and power in and near the city – the model miners’ village and the fantastical Jacobean castle in Bolsover, the stately home of Wentworth Woodhouse with its battleship-length Palladian facade, the buildings of the subtle modernist Peter Womersley in Huddersfield.Also the Weston Park Museum in Sheffield and the Derby Museum and Art Gallery, both of which combine world-class art with humdrum relics of local life. In one, a large John Singer Sargent portrait of three young Yorkshire women shares the premises with the plastic car roof sign of a 1970s driving school. In the other, there is a gallery full of the illuminated tableaux of science and humanity by Joseph Wright of Derby and another room with a collection of stuffed animals, presumably from a local donor. I hope institutions like this, apart from whatever upgrades might be desirable, don’t change: art comes to life when it’s seen as part of the place it comes from.

I started last year’s annual roundup by noting that it had been the hottest year on record and … guess what? 2024 has now surpassed 2023 as the hottest year ever. Many of the same extreme themes from last year have also persisted: anti-abortion activists are still trying to roll back reproductive rights in the US and the horrific situation for women in Iran and Afghanistan has only got worse.Meanwhile Gaza is still being destroyed, and – despite the fact that an increasing number of experts are terming the bombardment a “genocide” – the US is continuing to enable the destruction and much of the world is still continuing to look away. The civil war in Sudan, which started last April, has also spread catastrophically, with women and girls bearing the brunt of the humanitarian crisis.

The Guardian,The battle of Cable Street is entwined in my family’s history – and its message of hope still resonates  | Tracy-Ann Oberman,"On that day in 1936, members of my Jewish family stood up to the Blackshirts. Their fight against racism inspired our adaptation of The Merchant of VeniceIn the weeks leading up to the battle of Cable Street, Oswald Mosley, inspired by his friend Hitler, sent his Blackshirt militia into the East End of London to whip up hatred against Jewish people. Jewish buildings were daubed, synagogues smashed and posters calling for patriotism and national pride in the face of the “untrustworthy international Jewish Entity” were nailed on walls and doorways.Then, on Sunday 4 October 1936, the fourth birthday of Mosley’s fascist party, he sent more than 3,000 uniformed Blackshirts in four marching columns through London’s East End and its predominantly Jewish community, promising a “Greater Britain” and blaming all society’s ills on these immigrant Jews. He fully expected to be supported by the working-class population of the area and assumed it would be delighted by his rousing speeches of hate – as Mussolini and Hitler’s audiences had been abroad. Instead, the local community came together to drive the fascists out – immigrants, socialists, Jews and trade unionists stood side by side in solidarity.

Years later, another special woman rekindled my love of that placeIn our end of year series, writers and public figures remember the place or time when they felt most at homeIn the 18th century, physicians went looking for a nostalgia bone, as though a person’s yearning for a past time or place could be assigned to a chunk of tissue. But for me, writing in the 21st, the stimulus can be found not in the body I’m in, but the memories I carry. And in particular, as I edge further into my 40s, the memories of coastland I visited in the 1980s: a four-mile stretch in south-east Cornwall where my family and I summered each year with my grandmother.As a child, I would zigzag down the narrow cliff path with wild abandon, my mother nervously calling out to me as I sprinted down to the white sand below. This is where the roots of so many of my happy memories can be found. Not simply in the towering cliffs themselves, but in my fearless approach to them at that age, galloping towards the sea without any doubt that my legs would get me there.Kat Lister is the author of The Elements: A Widowhood Continue reading...","Sat, 28 Dec 2024 08:00:35 GMT",0.0,0.8824
The Guardian,"The Observer view on the UK economy: don’t despair, signs of growth are emerging","There are hazards ahead, but Rachel Reeves’s big calls in the budget have left the country better placed than the dominant narrative suggestsA downside of living in a country with an extraordinarily one-sided media is that it becomes ever harder not to be affected by the dissing-the-Labour-government-at-every-turn lens through which it sees the world. So it is with the economy. The story that an over-empowered chancellor has made a series of mistakes, so risking near certain economic stagflation, is told with relentless enthusiasm.The statistical revision before Christmas that showed there was no economic growth between July and September is allegedly proof of an economic stasis Rachel Reeves has engendered, while private sector wage inflation suddenly accelerating to 5.4% is obviously a harbinger of inflation to come. The Bank of England has paused further interest rate reductions despite the decline in business and consumer confidence. Investment remains stubbornly low. The Labour government is plainly the only cause of this worrying turn of events, according to the consensus narrative. The chancellor, exaggerating the balefulness of the Tory economic legacy, has talked down the economy. In addition, Labour has released the demon of public sector pay with generous settlements to doctors, nurses and railway workers, and heaped costs on business through its thoughtless £25bn hike in national insurance contributions and unnecessarily empowered workers with its proposed agenda for work. Typical Labour. Continue reading...","Sat, 28 Dec 2024 18:00:44 GMT",0.0772,0.1027
The Guardian,The Observer view on Jane Austen’s 250th anniversary: Once more unto the breeches | Editorial,"Plots and sprigged muslin aside, the author’s enduring legacy also lies in her relevance as a foil for modern moresFor some, it will be enough merely to re-read Persuasion, and thence to cry yet again at Captain Wentworth’s declaration of utmost love for Anne Elliot. But during the many and various celebrations in 2025 that will mark the 250th anniversary of the birth of Jane Austen, others, it seems, are planning to take a rather more full-hearted approach. Be warned: there will be breeches.In Bath, where Austen took up residence in 1801, a series of costume balls are to be staged, one with a seaside theme inspired by the uncompleted Sanditon. At Chawton in Hampshire, where she lived with her mother and sister Cassandra from 1809, festivals will be devoted to Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Emma, the latter to include a Dress Up Day, should you happen to have a sprigged muslin gown hanging at the back of your wardrobe.

The Guardian,Rare earths: another reason we mustn’t allow Russia to win in Ukraine | Letters,"Dictators in Russia and China should be denied further control of raw materials used in electronics, writes John E Havard. Plus a letter from Fawzi IbrahimA footnote to the excellent article by Timothy Garton Ash (What if Russia wins in Ukraine? We can already see the shadows of a dark 2025, 21 December). The so-called rare earths are essential raw materials for advanced electronics industries. China – with the world’s largest economically exploitable reserves – has a major strategic advantage in access to rare earths, underlined by the tight export controls that it has recently imposed. In Europe, it is eastern Ukraine that has the best reserves. To gain and maintain control of Ukraine’s reserves would be a major boost for Russia.A defeat here for Ukraine, enabled by the failure of the west to provide the long-term support that it has promised, would signal to China that it should not be too concerned about western resolve in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Taiwan is a dominant supplier of the advanced electronics, incorporating rare earths, that will continue to be a major determinant of economic success.

The Guardian,14 of the best men’s coats for winter – from puffers and parkas to trenches,"A quality coat is central to a successful winter wardrobe, so here are our top tips for choosing the perfect style for youDuring winter, you wear your coat more than anything else in your wardrobe. When the drizzly season hits, it’s the weatherproof saviour that makes leaving the house just about bearable. Beyond practicalities, though, it’s also an important style choice. As the top layer of every outfit, it’s the piece of clothing everyone sees first, so you need to make it count.There’s much to consider when hitting the shops for a new piece of outerwear. Will it be warm enough? Is it a design you’ll wear in a year’s time? Does it coordinate with the rest of your wardrobe? Continue reading...","Wed, 18 Dec 2024 15:00:03 GMT",0.6369,0.9237
The Guardian,"Kieran Culkin on pranks, parenting and why his famous family doesn’t need therapy: ‘Us siblings, we’re already cooked’","He’s been on screen since he was seven – but only prepares for a scene 10 minutes before. Yet somehow the mischievous Succession star is now tipped for an Oscar. How did the chaotic, charismatic actor do it?Kieran Culkin tries the upright chair first, the one opposite me, high-backed and leather. But no, that’s no good. He can see his reflection in the wall mirror, he’ll be catching himself all interview, thinking how tired he looks with his hooded eyes and beard, how jet&nbsp;lagged. Sleep is always tricky, but he’s been up with the kids – five and three – who weren’t supposed to join him for this publicity tour but there was a last-minute crisis, the short version of which is that the whole family is over from New York (with Culkin, 42, there’s always a long and short version).So, he flumps on the banquette, where he’ll be facing guests drinking afternoon cocktails in the low-lit, high-ceilinged bar here at the Corinthia hotel in London. He tests the firmness of the upholstery. Pantomimes boneless relaxation. Looks at me to gauge the distance between us. No, this won’t do, either. He’s too low, these people are distracting and, proximity-wise, he’s a little close. He scrambles back to the chair. Grabs the drinks menu. Muses that you may as well have the expensive thing if you’re not paying, orders champagne plus whatever trimmings, strains to peek at my notes. “Your fun notes. Notes I am not allowed to see.” He taps his phone screen, “OK, your time starts … now.” Cackles like a cartoon villain. “Yeah, just kidding.” Continue reading...","Sat, 28 Dec 2024 10:00:35 GMT",0.0,-0.9365

The Guardian,On my radar: Jasleen Kaur’s cultural highlights,"The Turner prize-winner on the art of the Gaza Biennale, the joys of a queer community choir, and a poet who speaks to today’s injusticesThe artist Jasleen Kaur was born in Glasgow in 1986. She studied at Glasgow School of Art and later at the Royal College, and had her first solo show, Be Like Teflon, in London in 2021. She works mainly with installations, using everyday objects to explore identity, cultural memory and political belonging. Earlier this month, Kaur won the Turner prize for her 2023 exhibition Alter Altar at the Tramway in Glasgow, which memorably featured a replica of her dad’s red Ford Escort covered in an outsized doily.

The Guardian,Better Man review – Robbie Williams monkeys around in a raw and emotional biopic,"Replacing Williams with a CGI ape in an otherwise human cast pays off enormously in Michael Gracey’s warts-and-all tale of the pop phenomenonIt was a throwaway comment: Robbie Williams, Take That’s cheeky chappie-turned-tabloid fodder solo phenomenon, described himself as a performing monkey, prancing and preening in front of the cameras and seeking the approval of the audience (or at least a banana or two). But for director Michael Gracey (The Greatest Showman), it was the key to unlocking Williams’s conflicted relationship with his celebrity and his compulsion to perform. In a creative gamble to rival Piece by Piece director Morgan Neville’s decision to tell the Pharell Williams story with Lego animation recently, Gracey replaces Williams in this warts-and-all biopic with a CGI chimpanzee in an otherwise human cast. It’s a gamble that not only pays off – it’s arguably the main reason the film works as well as it does.Narrated by Williams (Jonno Davies delivers a motion-captured performance as Robbie the Monkey) in a tone that strikes a precarious balance between wry self-deprecation and maudlin self-pity, the story itself is pretty generic stuff: a by-the-numbers trawl through the early hardship of Williams’s working-class childhood in Stoke-on-Trent, father-son tensions and industrial-level substance-abuse issues. The film’s emotional beats – Williams’s doomed relationship with All Saints singer Nicole Appleton; the death of Robbie’s beloved nan – are hammered home with piledriver subtlety. But the capering ape device transforms what would otherwise be a rote addition to the rock biopic canon, infusing the story with humour, mischief and a sparky, unpredictable anarchy. Yes, Williams clearly takes himself pretty seriously and has a weakness for therapy-speak platitudes. But he also invites us to see him as a surly adolescent chimp in a shell suit. You have to love him for that.In UK and Irish cinemas Continue reading...","Sat, 28 Dec 2024 15:00:41 GMT",0.5423,0.9428

I was in the bar afterwards and, to my surprise, there she was. I’d read all her books – The Country Girls, August Is a Wicked Month, Girls in Their Married Bliss – because you could get them in the north of Ireland when they were banned in the south. Like a lot of people I was slightly in awe of her, but she came over and chatted and she was extremely warm and generous.Soon after that, she began to invite me to her famous soirees at her house in Carlyle Square in Chelsea, and we became friends. There were always big stars at her gatherings and she would cook roast lamb for everybody. I remember Jack Nicholson showed up at one. He kept calling her “Ed”, can you imagine?

They did change my life, but not in the way I’d hopedI love to run, but ask me about my running times or distances and I will have no idea. For me, running is about squeezing exercise into a busy schedule, clearing my head and being in nature.

The Guardian,How owls helped me conquer my fear of the dark,"With the aid of the birds I was able to learn to love the nightAs a child I was afraid of the dark, as so many children are. Not the dark in and of itself, but what I was certain it contained: bad spirits, bad people, monsters with ill intent. The dark hid creatures with talons and teeth, or men with weapons who would use them to sneak up on an unsuspecting child and do them harm. The dark let curses slip out of buildings or hedges and attach to a child walking past. I kept myself bounded within the dome of torchlight on winter afternoons, thinking of light as a spell of protection. I went to bed by the orange glow of a nightlight, the hall light on and the door ajar.I borrowed Jill Tomlinson’s book The Owl Who Was Afraid of the Dark from the library and fell in love with the baby barn owl, Plop. He thinks “dark is nasty” and won’t go hunting with his parents. He learns through others who love the dark that it can be exciting, kind, fun, necessary, wonderful, beautiful and super.

The Guardian,A ceramicist’s personal take on commemorative blue plaques – in pictures,"For more than 25 years, Horace Lindezey has been making art at Venture Arts, a Manchester-based studio working with learning disabled artists. In his ever-growing collection of ceramic blue plaques, created with the assistance of ceramicist Caroline Tattersall, he celebrates people who have meant something to him – family members, friends, TV personalities and musicians – focusing on life’s central milestones: births, marriages and deaths. “I feel happy with making the plaques,” says Lindezey. “I roll the clay on to the mould, paint it white, then I put the letters on it.

Their boy, Miles, was six months old at the time.“As I was taking him inside, I saw the reflection of my son’s back rolls in the glass door.” Ostrander grabbed his iPhone 14 Pro and turned the front camera on. “He was teething back then; not crying, but not his usual pleasant self either. I was juggling a wiggling baby and my phone, so I&nbsp;could only take two frames.” Continue reading...","Sat, 28 Dec 2024 10:00:35 GMT",0.6369,-0.2206
