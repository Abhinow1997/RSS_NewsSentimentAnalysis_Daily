The Guardian,The 50 best TV shows of 2024: No 5 – Industry,"It might be packed with unspeakably wild antics, but this full-throttle drama is clever, astonishingly written TV – which is on its way to being one of the greatest shows of all time• The 50 best TV shows of 2024• More on the best culture of 2024The coolest thing I am able to say at the kind of parties where people discuss TV is: “I’ve been an Industry guy since the first episode”. Looking back at that pilot, first broadcast in 2020, it feels far away and distant now in the shadow of season three’s outrageously huge finale: five baby-chick graduates all trying their best in their entry-level job interviews, the credits blazing with the searing but baffling-in-hindsight “Directed by: Lena Dunham”, most of the scenes actually being in the office. Go back and watch that episode now, I say at parties that I am fully aware I am being boring at, and it feels like a completely different show – I don’t think there was a single scene in season three when Harper looked at a computer, for instance – but because of how fast and how smartly Industry has evolved, that change doesn’t feel jarring. It started good and has only gotten better and bigger. With HBO renewing for season four before Kit Harington had even got peed on in season three, it can only get more daring and enormous.This is the season that everyone has caught up with my visionary zeal for the show, and it has been reflected (a sad admission) in my Reddit homepage algorithm. Industry has a fanbase now, a vociferous one, one that makes Yasmin and Rob edits and speculates about what moves Harper will make next and asks questions like, “Quick one, struggling to understand the show: what’s money?”. This is the year Industry has suffered from (but not bowed under the weight of) Succession comparisons, which for my money were slightly more apt in season two than now, seeing as it has evolved so completely into its own thing. But you can squint and see where the line between them might be drawn: like Succession, Industry is on HBO; like Succession, Industry paints ghoulish characters in vivid new colours (this year’s addition of Harington’s Henry Muck was a particularly interesting new texture of eco-when-it-suits-him posh boy: knows exactly what to say in gilded rooms and how to shake hands with tycoons but has a fragile chip in his ego that will never really be therapied away); like Succession, Industry has people whose thirst for success has bled into every aspect of their lives; like Succession, Industry has an incredible sideline in audacious I-can’t-believe-they-typed-that-and-I-can’t-believe-HBO-allowed-it-and-I-can’t-believe-they-convinced-an-actor-to-say-it! dialogue. I’m not allowed to repeat any of my favourite lines but search for the mouthwash comment from the fantastic Rishi-centred episode White Mischief, and you’ll see what I mean.

However, for a new era of kids coming up under punk at the Ratinger Hof club, the opposite was true. “They were uncool,” says Robert Görl of DAF. “You viewed yourself as the opposite of them.”“Boring, sedate and sterile” was how his late bandmate Gabi Delgado once described the music of Kraftwerk, who were disliked so much that some took to violence against them in the club if they showed up.

He is a problem, a royal problem: it’s time they owned itNo matter how much you try to digest the implications of the alleged Chinese spy scandal, some details are just comically indigestible. Take the fact that Prince Andrew has somehow contrived to find staff even stupider than him. Here is one senior aide called Dominic Hampshire, writing in March 2020 to the Chinese businessman with whom the Duke of York has found himself unfortunately entangled: “Outside of [Andrew’s] closest internal confidants, you sit at the very top of a tree that many, many people would like to be on.” Sorry, is this March 2020? A full four months after the four-dimensional pile-up that was Andrew’s Newsnight interview? Which was followed immediately by the duke’s own mother sacking him? Dominic, there were ventilators that people would rather have been on than that tree.Or take the fact that the rural Buckinghamshire pub where David Cameron took the Chinese premier Xi Jinping for a pint in 2015 was bought by a Chinese firm called SinoFortune, which seems to have promised billions of UK investment that never materialised.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"What price a wonderful Santa memory for you and your kid? Try £24: ‘ho, ho, ho’ not included | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett","The ‘blatantly fake beard’, the ‘cheap red suit’? It must be that time of year again – the season of the great fleecingDid you take your kids to see Santa this year? If so, how much did you pay? At one grotto in Winchester, it was £18.50 per child and £6 per adult, so no wonder if people took exception to his “blatantly fake beard” and “cheap red suit” and demanded their money back. “I’ve seen better Santas rolling around town on their way to Christmas parties,” one visitor complained. For that price, you’d expect a “Ho, ho, ho!” at the very least, but those weren’t apparently forthcoming, either. (As an aside, Hampshire really isn’t doing much to bolster its festive rep this year, after one of its vicars also apparently told schoolchildren that Santa isn’t real.)
 Yes, it’s that time of year again – the season of the great Christmas fleecing, felt by all of us, but especially parents. Just what, exactly, are parents in Winchester paying £6 for? To stand there for five minutes and take a photo? At least London zoo doesn’t charge the adults at its Santa’s grotto. But the price – £17.50 per child – practically requires you take out a new mortgage, and doesn’t include zoo admission; and that’s for just your basic, no-frills meet-and-greet. If you want to opt for the “Meet Santa Deluxe”, it’s “only” £22.50 more per child. You find yourself wondering what, exactly, makes him so luxurious – a cashmere beard, perhaps?I know I probably sound Grinchy, but I hate the money-making cynicism of it, and what that says about us as a nation (you want childhood magic? Well, it’ll cost you). Most galling of all is the horrific number of children in poverty who aren’t getting enough to eat, let alone to see Santa. Would it really be so hard for one of the many decent blokes with a DBS check to put on a costume and go to meet some children for free?

The Guardian,I went to see two very different pantos this week. Here's what I learned | Zoe Williams,"After watching the glitziest pantomime in London, I had a night out at a hilarious ‘adult’ show. It was a good reminder that you don’t need big money to deliver big laughsThey call the Palladium Christmas pantomime “the glitziest show in town”, which basically means “most expensive”. I feel moved to point out that I wasn’t paying; I went with my friend, who is a theatre critic. It’s anyone’s guess which sounds the most boastful: “I’m so well-connected, I get to go to a panto for free” or “I’m so incredibly rich I could blow 200 quid on a theatre ticket”. Let’s say they are both as bad as each other.It was Robin Hood, starring Jane McDonald, Julian Clary and Nigel Havers, but the first convention of panto is that the story doesn’t really exist. They’re looking to create a spectacle that reminds you a bit of a dream you once had about the story. If ever there is anything on the stage and you can’t for the life of you figure out the point of it – an incredibly long and repetitive song, for instance, in which people nearly hit each other in the face with blunt objects – it’s because there is a convention. Person shamed in the audience, typically for being bald? Call-and-response demands from the audience? A sudden shower of delicious sweets, probably Freddos? These are the building blocks of the form, which is the only one the English have ever invented, said my friend. I said: “What about … ?” and he said: “Don’t say morris dancing”, and I was actually going to say cockfighting, but only because I had already been overexposed to Clary and Havers.

But once he is making decisions that affect people’s daily lives, Musk may find the shine wears offCongratulations to Elon Musk, a genius of truly galactic proportions, who recently made what might have been the world’s savviest investment. The tech billionaire spent more than $277m backing Donald Trump, along with a number of other Republican candidates in the election – and that quarter-billion-dollar investment has paid off nicely. Musk’s net worth has increased by 77% since Trump’s victory, and has now surpassed $400bn (£315bn), according to a recent estimate from Bloomberg, making him the first person ever to officially reach such a milestone. Still, in just a couple of years, Musk’s current fortune might look like chump change: the man is reportedly on track to become the world’s first trillionaire by 2027.How did he get (even more) rich so quick? Well, if you want to be diplomatic about it, as CNN was, you can say something like “an alliance with president-elect Donald Trump has pushed his ventures to the forefront”. But the more direct answer is that everyone knows the incoming Trump administration’s guiding principle is quid pro quo. Since it seems highly likely that taxpayer money will be funnelled towards Musk’s various companies, the value of those companies has been blowing up. Kind of like his SpaceX rockets – one of which exploded so ferociously earlier this year that it tore a hole in the ionosphere. Is that a bad thing? Iono.

The Guardian,The ‘quad-demic’ is here – and with it I have become a disease detective | Zoe Williams,"Anytime anyone tells me they are ill, I now launch endless inquisitions about their symptoms. Why do I care so much?Neologisms may have the excitement of the strange, but there is nothing exciting about the “quad-demic” if you’re afflicted by it. Even if the idea of getting out of a load of events is thrilling to you, you would still prefer to have a cold, or maybe sprain your ankle, than get any of the quartet: flu, Covid, respiratory syncytial virus or norovirus.Nevertheless, with warnings of a “tidal wave” of disease this winter, any time anyone is ill, I want to know where on the quad they would put themselves. And people are ill everywhere you look, which is, I guess, why they’re calling it a “quad-demic”. It’s not, particularly in the case of norovirus, any of my business. It takes studied restraint to stop me drilling in for symptoms.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"If you’ve got children, you need to watch Swiped – and see how sick their phones are making them | Simon Jenkins","The terrible toll that smartphones are taking on young people is now undeniable. We need to start talking about a banEvery parent of a school-age child should watch Swiped, the Channel 4 documentary on smartphones shown last week. It was devastating. It told of an Essex secondary school’s experiment in response to what it saw as a rise in anxiety and stress among its 11-year-olds. A group of them agreed to surrender their phones for three weeks.The parents’ stories were familiar – of children unable to make eye contact with adults, no longer chatting with ease, spending hours alone and staying awake into the small hours. Some spent five, six, even nine hours a day on their phones. They made “friends” with total strangers, received hate mail, suffered panic attacks, went from normal to self-harm. Surveys claim a quarter of British 11-year-olds have now watched online pornography. One child died in tragic circumstances closely linked to their social media use.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Tue, 17 Dec 2024 10:00:46 GMT",-0.5106,-0.9841
The Guardian,The Guardian view on a Moscow assassination: Ukraine’s justified strike and Russia’s baseless outrage | Editorial,"Kyiv’s targeted killings expose the reach of its intelligence services, challenging the Kremlin’s war machine while sticking to the laws of warRussia’s leadership is furious that one of their top commanders has been assassinated by Ukrainian spies. Yet their anger seems misplaced: the targeted killing of Lt Gen Igor Kirillov was not an unprovoked act, but a consequence of Russia’s ongoing offensive and Ukraine’s right to defend itself under international law.The explosion that shook a quiet Moscow neighbourhood – eliminating the head of the Russian military’s chemical, biological and radiological weapons unit, known as RKhBZ – also revealed the unexpectedly formidable capabilities of Ukraine’s secret service (SBU). The general and his assistant are the most senior figures assassinated since Russia’s 2022 invasion. The pair were killed when a bomb, concealed in a parked scooter outside a Moscow residential building, was remotely detonated. Continue reading...","Tue, 17 Dec 2024 18:32:21 GMT",-0.7184,-0.9836
The Guardian,The Guardian view on online safety: ministers must stand up to big tech | Editorial,"With a code full of holes, Ofcom has shown that it is unfit to hold the world’s biggest businesses to accountNo one, not even its biggest supporters, thought that last year’s Online Safety Act was perfect. Finding a balance between free expression and digital access on the one hand, and the prevention of various kinds of harm on the other, was a hugely challenging task. The resulting legislation has been criticised as confused. But it was an important first step in regulating some of the world’s most powerful companies, and forcing them to comply with values – enshrined in laws – made in parliament and not boardrooms.Much of the detail was left to Ofcom, the media regulator. This was a mistake by the last government, which should have adopted a broader-brush approach rooted in principle rather than process. But the narrowly technocratic code issued by Ofcom on Monday has compounded the error. Rather than filling in the gaps in the act, Ofcom has left loopholes for both online predators and the businesses that profit while enabling them. One particularly dismaying omission is measures targeted at sites promoting suicide and self-harm. Continue reading...","Tue, 17 Dec 2024 18:31:44 GMT",0.4215,0.8656
The Guardian,Reducing jury trials will imperil confidence in the justice system | Letters,"Readers respond to Labour plans to set up a new tier of court without juries to clear the backlog of casesSo the remedy for the problems in the criminal justice system is to create a third tier of criminal court to dispense quicker but, inevitably, second-rate justice (Some jury trials may be scrapped in England and Wales as court backlog hits record high, 12 December). Crown court, magistrates court and kangaroo court. Who will have confidence in a court that has the power to impose substantial custodial sentences, but has no jury&nbsp;and will consist of a&nbsp;judge and&nbsp;two magistrates?Such middle-class justice is not going to be well received among the ethnic minorities in our inner cities, who are likely to find themselves at the sharp end of it. How can the procedure be swifter and at the same time be as fair as trial by judge and jury? What do we cut out? Problems are best solved by establishing the&nbsp;root cause and fixing it.

The Guardian,The role of courts in tackling addiction | Letters,"Stuart Harrington says decriminalising drugs would be more productive than specialist courts, while Jane Lawson remembers a pioneering court that kept families togetherHaving specialist courts that can impose treatment orders rather than prison sentences for those whose offending is related to substance addiction may be a cheaper option than a custodial sentence, but they will not address the issue of why so many desperate addicts are forced into criminal activity (Specialist courts proposed to break addictions of prolific offenders in England and Wales, 11 December).In the UK, half of all recorded acquisitive crimes are drug-related – and half of all homicides. As long as the acts of procuring and using drugs remain illegal, desperate people will find themselves drawn into a spiral of criminal behaviour. Rather than adding an extra layer to the judiciary, a more cost-effective and humane option would be the decriminalisation of drug use – which has been proven to be effective in reducing harm and criminal activity.

The Guardian,Mudryk mystery deepens as failed drugs test threatens to ruin career,"Already struggling to deal with expectations, nobody knows when the Chelsea winger will set foot on a pitch againPeople who come across Mykhailo Mudryk often sense a distance. Intentionally or not, mystery attaches itself to the shy young man who caused such excitement when he turned up at Stamford Bridge in January 2023. None of the winger’s managers at Chelsea have been able to crack the code and the sense is that Mudryk’s guard will go higher after the Football Association provisionally suspended him after&nbsp;a positive drug test.This is a story without winners. A career that promised so much is in danger of falling apart, and one of the saddest aspects of Mudryk’s plight is that his absence is unlikely&nbsp;to derail Chelsea’s burgeoning title challenge.

The Guardian,Avanti West Coast workers to strike on New Year’s Eve,"Avanti says it is assessing how much impact strikes will have but spokesperson says disruption will be ‘significant’Workers on Avanti West Coast will go on strike on New Year’s Eve after rejecting a deal designed to resolve an ongoing dispute over rest day working.
 The dispute is over enhanced pay for rest day working, including voluntary overtime to cover staff absences such as those caused by vacancies, sickness, annual leave and training.
 The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said its members working as train managers would strike on New Year’s Eve, 2 January and Sundays between 12 January and 25 May.
 An RMT spokesperson said: “Our members have resoundingly rejected Avanti’s latest offers in two referendums, and sustained strike action is now the only way to focus management’s minds on reaching a negotiated settlement with the union.”
 The RMT said up to 400 of its members were involved in the dispute. They voted by 83% against the suggested deal.
 Avanti said it was assessing how the strikes would affect its services and would confirm its plans as soon as possible.
 Strikes planned for 22, 23 and 29 December were suspended last week after a suggested agreement was put to a referendum of RMT members.
 An Avanti West Coast spokesperson said: “This strike action will cause significant disruption to our customers making journeys on the West Coast Main Line over an extended period.“We’re disappointed our train managers, who are RMT members, have voted to decline the very reasonable, revised offer made to them to resolve the rest day working dispute and avoid inconveniencing our customers. We remain open to working with the RMT to resolve the dispute.”
 A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “This is incredibly disappointing news for passengers who would have been hoping to leave strike action in 2024, and we strongly encourage both the RMT and Avanti West Coast to get back around the table and work in good faith to resolve this as quickly as possible.
 “As part of our plans to reform the railways, we’re determined to move towards a seven-day working week and end the overreliance on rest day working, giving passengers the certainty and reliability they deserve.”
 Speaking in May at an International Workers Day rally, the RMT boss, Mick Lynch, said he did not trust the prime minister, Keir Starmer. “I don’t trust him completely. I know that he’s going to do something, but empty gestures are no good,” he said.
 Lynch added: “We’ve had 45 years now of Thatcherism, and that’s what’s causing all our problems. We’ve got embedded in Thatcherism, which is coming home to roost now with all these problems, so I don’t have to trust him, I know that he’s going to be in power and I’ve got to make sure that he does the job that he’s committing to.” Continue reading...","Tue, 17 Dec 2024 20:19:21 GMT",-0.128,-0.9348

Sustainability is frustratingly complicated for those of us who want to lay on a cheeseboard without guilt this Christmas. Most of us now know about livestock emissions, global deforestation in the name of producing feed, and the pollution – via agricultural runoff – of local waterways.

The Guardian,The TV killing spree: why are so many smash-hit shows about women being murdered?,"In the last few months, grisly dramas about violence against women have topped the television ratings. They are part of a trend – and attract enormous female audiencesArriving home from work the other day in the wind and rain, my mood was further darkened by news headlines about Trump, floods across the UK, and a US military expert proclaiming that the world is now at its most geopolitically dangerous since the second world war. Reaching for the remote, I switched channels in search of my go-to stress remedy – a nice juicy murder drama.It might sound counterintuitive to find solace in such grisly fare, but I find there is something soothing about following a plotline where someone, usually a woman, comes to harm or tries to outwit a psychopath, leading to an investigation. Clearly I’m not alone. On Netflix, Woman of the Hour, a film in which an aspiring actor (Anna Kendrick) crosses paths with a serial killer, topped the ratings in October until it was dethroned by Don’t Move, in which a grieving woman is paralysed by a serial killer. In September, also on Netflix, another drama about a murdered woman, The Perfect Couple, racked up 3.4bn minutes of viewing time in its first week. It became the streamer’s biggest show since Bridgerton. Continue reading...","Tue, 17 Dec 2024 10:00:45 GMT",-0.8689,-0.9551

The Guardian,Mufasa: The Lion King review – storytelling takes pride of place in punchy origin tale,"This heartfelt prequel to the 1994 classic recounts the dramatic backstory of King Mufasa but is scarred by a forgettable musical scoreHow did Scar, the wicked uncle from The Lion King voiced by Jeremy Irons, get to be so … well … wicked? How is it that he was only ever known by that cruel and callous nickname, while everyone else got noble-sounding multisyllabic names ending in vowels? Was he once nice, even misunderstood? And, in providing the answers, will the prequel give a clear rebuke to the now rather discredited facial-scarring-equals-evil equation? Well, the answers will show that this movie musical, like the original, is still a rather old-fashioned Kiplingesque creation at heart.It is certainly Scar who has the important character arc and narrative journey here, so it should perhaps be his name in the title. Mufasa, originally voiced by the legendary James Earl Jones, here turns out to be a thoroughly and unsurprisingly decent character from the outset. This movie, a backstory-followup to the 1994 classic in the same photorealistic animated style as the 2019 reboot, is in fact a punchy, heartfelt and rather ingenious drama, with a fair bit of storytelling energy from screenwriter Jeff Nathanson and director Barry Jenkins.

Accompanied by ditzy Mellotron and wide-eyed flute, the song verges on romcom territory, with singer-songwriter Claire Cottrill as the unlucky-in-love lead. But behind the flirtation there’s a painful, driving need to want and be wanted in return. “I need a reason to get out of the house,” she admits, before softening the blow of rejection with the metaphor of a casting call: “Ask if I’m in a movie, no, I didn’t get the part.”Charm dwells in this world of attraction and desire. Giddy songs such as Second Nature, with its heartbeat pulse of piano and Cottrill’s nervous laughter, exist in the magnetic forcefield between two people inexplicably drawn together. But with Clairo’s typical incisiveness, her third – and best by far – album is also about what happens when the spell wears off, and when closeness becomes cloying. “Do you miss my hands hanging on the back of your neck?” she asks on the deceptively breezy Add Up My Love, before shrugging it off, playing it cool: “It’s just something I’m into.” Continue reading...","Tue, 17 Dec 2024 14:00:41 GMT",0.6908,0.9859

Crow Country, Fear the Spotlight and now Mouthwashing all make terrifying use of low-poly characters, smeared textures and muted colour palettes to generate dread and abjection – and in this sci-fi odyssey from Wrong Organ they’re also brilliantly utilised to symbolise complete psychological breakdown.The setup to Mouthwashing is simple and familiar: when a hulking spacecraft crashes in a remote part of the galaxy, the small crew slowly goes insane waiting for a rescue that is never going to come. Not helping matters is their cargo: millions of gallons of high-alcohol mouthwash – which very quickly gets abused by the desperate and deeply flawed castaways.

The dance era was coming to an end and Britpop was exploding, but then this American rock band Extreme had a huge hit with a power ballad, More Than Words, so I thought it would be OK to break the mould.

The Guardian,Is our model of the universe wrong? – podcast,"For the past 10 years cosmologists have been left scratching their heads over why two methods for measuring the universe’s rate of expansion provide totally different results. There are two possible solutions to the puzzle, known as the Hubble tension: either something is wrong with the measurements or something is wrong with our model of the universe. It was hoped that observations from the James Webb space telescope might shed some light on the problem, but instead results published last week have continued to muddy the waters. To understand why the expansion rate of the universe remains a mystery, and what might be needed to finally pin it down, Madeleine Finlay speaks to Catherine Heymans, the astronomer royal for Scotland and a professor of astrophysics at the University of EdinburghThe Hubble constant: a mystery that keeps getting biggerSupport the Guardian: theguardian.com/sciencepod Continue reading...","Tue, 17 Dec 2024 05:00:40 GMT",-0.4767,-0.5346

The Guardian,Gotta lotta bottle: doing the rounds with Britain’s last milkmen – photo essay,"Their floats were once a regular sight, quietly whirring down the country’s streets, delivering daily pints. Photographer Maxine Beuret captures the vanishing world of electric milk floats (and their drivers)You often hear them before you see them: the unmistakable clink and tinkle of glass bottles in crates, and the low whine of the electric motor. Milk floats are a uniquely British sight, and an increasingly rare one, which is why the British photographer and cultural historian Maxine Beuret has spent 20 years documenting their use by dairies across England, as part of her project Two Pints Please.Beuret, who calls herself a historian of the commonplace, has documented several quirks of British culture that are at risk of disappearing (or have since gone), including slam-door commuter trains, TfL’s Routemaster buses before they were decommissioned, and traditional shops in the Midlands including a sweet shop, a men’s outfitters and a hardware store. She first photographed an electric milk float while undertaking another project called Familiar Interiors of Leicester – her hometown – in 2005. As well as creating a record of the library, the hospital, the pub and other cherished places, she visited the local dairy, Kirby &amp; West, and “instantly fell in love” with the milk floats, she says. “I&nbsp;loved the compact, functional design, clean lines, and fragile sense of history they carried with them.”Overlooking the yard at Parker Dairies Continue reading...","Sat, 14 Dec 2024 08:00:10 GMT",0.0,0.765
