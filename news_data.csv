The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Moscow claims control of Velyka Novosilka but Ukrainians say fight continues,"Warehouse strike in Russia ‘destroys 200 Shahed drones’; Ryazan oil refinery hit again, says Kyiv’s military. What we know on day 1,069Russia on Sunday claimed its troops had captured Velyka Novosilka, a strategically important town in the Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine. The statement could not be independently verified, and Ukraine’s 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade said its troops had only strategically withdrawn from certain parts of Velyka Novosilka to avoid encirclement. “This does not mean that we have completely left the city, the fighting in Velyka Novosilka continues. All actions are aimed at minimising our own losses and maximum damage to the enemy.” The brigade said the withdrawal would make it topographically difficult for Russians to advance by making the river an obstacle. “The enemy … will have no peace, any movement is cut off by shells and drones.”Russia also claimed it troops had taken control of the settlement of Zelene in Donetsk region. There was no independent confirmation. Zelene lies south of Pokrovsk where Russia has incurred mass casualties in a grinding campaign against Ukrainian defenders. In its latest Russia-Ukraine war assessment, the Institute for the Study of War said: “Russian forces recently advanced near Toretsk, Pokrovsk, Kurakhove, and Velyka Novosilka.”Ukraine’s military said it destroyed 200 Shahed drones in an attack on warehouses in the Oryol region of Russia. “Concrete structures were hit, where thermobaric warheads, which are used to equip drones, were stored. There is information about a strong secondary detonation.”Ukraine on Sunday claimed a further successful drone strike on the Ryazan oil refinery south-east of Moscow. It was the second attack on the same site in less that two weeks. Kyiv said the refinery is one of the four largest in Russia and is used by Moscow’s air force. “Explosions and a fire were recorded in the targeted area,” it said. The Russian regional governor in Ryazan – Pavel Malkov – said Russian air defence had “destroyed” drones over the region and that authorities were assessing the damage. Russian officials routinely falsely claim that all attacking drones were destroyed and any damage was only caused by falling debris.An undersea fibre optic cable between Latvia and Sweden was damaged on Sunday, likely as a result of external influence, Latvia said, prompting Nato to deploy patrol ships to the area and triggering a sabotage investigation by Swedish authorities. Nato was coordinating military ships and aircraft under its recently deployed mission, dubbed Baltic Sentry. The effort follows a string of incidents in which power cables, telecom links and gas pipelines have been damaged in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

The Guardian,Rachel’s Farm review – an 80s star’s eco project gives us all hope of salvation,"Actor Rachel Ward’s sterling efforts to farm sustainably make for an inspiring, charming documentary. It places optimism and energy front and centreHang on – the Rachel in Rachel’s Farm is Rachel Ward?! By heavens, it is! She was the star of the 1983 cassock-ripper The Thorn Birds, which united several countries in pursuit of the question of whether her young, wild Meggie – in the Australian outback to help her aunt run a sheep station – would persuade the local priest (played by 1983’s Richard Chamberlain) to forsake his calling for earthly pleasures. Well, Ward has now forsaken acting&nbsp;for literal earthly pleasures and become a regenerative farmer.This charming and inspiring (if slightly rambling) 90-minute film takes us to the smallholding she and her husband, Bryan Brown (yes, him from The Thorn Birds, too! They met on set and have been together ever&nbsp;since!), have used for decades as a holiday escape from their lives in Sydney. It follows their efforts to make the farm ecologically sustainable. She is clearly the driving force, while Brown is happy to go along with everything. “I’m totally supportive,” he says with&nbsp;an easy grin from an easy chair on the porch. “As&nbsp;long as it&nbsp;doesn’t cost me a bundle.” Continue reading...","Sun, 26 Jan 2025 22:25:01 GMT",0.4404,0.9953

They told Hansford that Marcus Garvey, the revolutionary Jamaican leader who pushed for the unity of Black people and a collective return to Africa, would soon be posthumously pardoned for mail fraud.Hansford dialed in Garvey’s son, Dr Julius Garvey, for a three-way call to break the news to him before it hit the newspaper circuit. As he thought of his nearly two decades of legal and advocacy work to help exonerate Garvey, Hansford remembered Garvey’s wife Amy Jacques who began the efforts to pardon him in 1923.

The Guardian,The Thing with Feathers review – Benedict Cumberbatch’s grief horror falls apart,"Sundance film festival: An unaffecting adaptation of Max Porter’s acclaimed novella is perched awkwardly between fantasy and reality, failing to convince on either levelThe messiness of grief, something most of us know too well, has been given a smoothing effect on screen, an experience so awful and unpleasant made easily, annoyingly palatable. The cliches that have come to define it have become so normalised that we often forget what it’s really like to see the horrible, frightening reality shown to us. On the page, and stage, Max Porter’s novella Grief is the Thing with Feathers was for many, a fantastical yet identifiable story of loss, the tale of a father losing his wife transformed into a dark, magical fable of transformative horror. Its central conceit – a giant crow haunting the aftermath of death – was such a compelling visual that, despite the pitfalls that come with adapting something so beloved, the big screen felt like a natural next step.In his introduction before the adaptation’s late-night Sundance premiere, writer and director Dylan Southern (whose work has previously focused on music documentaries) informed us that this would be no traditional grief drama, a subgenre one has come to often glumly expect from the festival. This would be something far more unusual.The Thing with Feathers is screening at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution Continue reading...","Sun, 26 Jan 2025 17:38:26 GMT",-0.7845,-0.8388

Father Frank Mann, a retired priest from Brooklyn, offered a blessing to the ruthless real estate operator who made his fortune in the borough and bankrolled his son’s pilgrimage over the Queensboro Bridge into Manhattan to blow a half-billion dollars through six bankruptcies and the financial collapse of the Taj Mahal Hotel and Trump Castle casino in Jersey City, and a blessing for Fred’s wife, too, without whom “this day would never be the miracle that has just begun”.Father Frank had struck up a relationship with Donald after he sent him a photograph of how he had weeded the Trump family gravesite at the Lutheran All Faiths Cemetery. A single tombstone marks not only Donald’s parents, but also Fred’s father and mother, Donald’s original immigrant grandparents – Friedrich deemed an undesirable in Germany – and Fred Jr, subject of Fred’s abuse that helped drive him into alcoholism and his early spot in the family plot. “From their place in heaven,” intoned Father Frank, “may they shield their son from all harm by their loving protection and give him the strength to guide our nation along the path that will make America great again”.Sidney Blumenthal is a Guardian US columnist.

Here’s my new corporate glossaryI note, wearily, that the work culture wars grind on. We are in the midst of yet another push to get staff back in to the office, with Amazon, Morgan Stanley and Asda all desperately trying to stuff the human genie back into its cubicle bottle. Staff at the Office for National Statistics and the Land Registry, among others, have voted to strike to preserve their right to work from home (WFH). Stuart Rose, former CEO of M&amp;S and until November executive chair of Asda, told Panorama that home work isn’t “proper work” and the Mail quotes a “Gen Z CEO” saying he is wrong. Can’t we all just get along?One possible explanation for the continued conflict is that we have become strangers to each other.

The Guardian,"Until we tackle the nihilistic rage behind terrorism, it will stay the menace of our age | Kenan Malik","We need to rethink our understanding of violent attacks such as in Southport, in order to confront the deeper reasons why furious young men kill‘Britain faces a new threat,” Keir Starmer claimed last week after Axel Rudakubana pleaded guilty to the murders of three young girls in a Taylor Swift dance class in Southport; terror not just from “highly organised groups with clear political intent” but also “acts of extreme violence perpetrated by loners, misfits, young men in their bedroom, accessing all manner of material online, desperate for notoriety”. The Crown Prosecution Service, to the outrage of many, has refused to categorise the Southport killings as terrorism because “there is no evidence the purpose was to advance a particular political or ideological cause”.This, though, is not a new feature of terror assaults. “What such attacks expose is the continuing degeneration of Islamist terror and the increasingly blurred lines between ideological violence and sociopathic rage.” I&nbsp;wrote those words almost eight years ago after an attack on the Houses of Parliament by Khalid Masood in March 2017.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on commemorating Auschwitz’s liberation: the urgency of Holocaust remembrance | Editorial,"Eighty years after the Nazi death camp was freed, the testimony of survivors is as crucial as everMemory is fragile. A decade ago, 300 survivors gathered at Auschwitz to commemorate the Nazi death camp’s liberation. On Monday, 50 will assemble for the 80th anniversary. The median age of Holocaust survivors was estimated at 86 in a study published last year. At 97, Esther Senot is still keeping the promise she made to her dying sister Fanny, whose last wish was that she “tell what happened to us ... so that we are not forgotten by history.” Almost 1 million of the 6 million Jews murdered in the Holocaust were killed at the complex in German-occupied Poland, along with smaller numbers of Poles,&nbsp;Roma and Sinti, Soviet prisoners of war, gay men, political prisoners and others. Its name has become synonymous with evil.The Auschwitz museum’s decision to ban speeches by politicians this year may be in part pragmatic. Holocaust memory has too often been a battleground in Poland. The museum’s mission stands above politics, yet cannot be wholly insulated from global affairs. Vladimir Putin has attended in the past, but there will be no Russian presence this time. Earlier this&nbsp;month, Poland’s deputy foreign minister appeared&nbsp;to suggest that authorities would be obliged to arrest the Israeli prime minister if he travelled to the ceremony, because the international criminal court has&nbsp;issued a warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu’s arrest for alleged war crimes in Gaza. The Polish prime minister, Donald&nbsp;Tusk, insisted Mr Netanyahu would be able to attend safely, though Israel’s delegation is not expected to include him.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"The Guardian view on a global AI race: geopolitics, innovation and the rise of chaos | Editorial","China’s tech leap challenges US dominance through innovation. But unregulated competition increases the risk of catastropheEight years ago, Vladimir Putin proclaimed that mastering artificial intelligence (AI) would make a nation the “ruler of the world”. Western tech sanctions after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine should have dashed his ambitions to lead in AI by 2030. But that might be too hasty a judgment. Last week, the Chinese lab DeepSeek unveiled R1, an AI that analysts say rivals OpenAI’s top reasoning model, o1. Astonishingly, it matches o1’s capabilities while using a fraction of the computing power – and at a tenth of the cost. Predictably, one of Mr Putin’s first moves in 2025 was to align with China on AI development. R1’s launch seems no coincidence, coming just as Donald Trump backed OpenAI’s $500bn Stargate plan to outpace its peers. OpenAI has singled out DeepSeek’s parent, High Flyer Capital, as a potential threat. But at least three Chinese labs claim to rival or surpass OpenAI’s achievements.Anticipating tighter US chip sanctions, Chinese companies stockpiled critical processors to ensure their AI models could advance despite restricted access to hardware. DeepSeek’s success underscores the ingenuity born of necessity: lacking massive datacentres or powerful specialised chips, it achieved breakthroughs through better data curation and optimisation of its model. Unlike proprietary systems, R1’s source code is public, allowing anyone competent to modify it. Yet its openness has limits: overseen by China’s internet&nbsp;regulator, R1 conforms to “core socialist values”. Type in Tiananmen Square or Taiwan, and the&nbsp;model&nbsp;reportedly shuts down the conversation. Continue reading...","Sun, 26 Jan 2025 17:25:55 GMT",-0.2732,0.9745
The Guardian,How disabled adults are sidelined by social care | Letters,"Charging people on benefits for care in their homes causes real financial hardship, writes Claire Bolderson, while Jill Souter worries for the future of the charity that cares for her daughter. Plus, letters from Ray Downing and John BeerJohn Harris is right about the lack of attention given to working-age adults with disabilities in discussions about the reform of social care (Shut away and ignored: thousands of disabled adults are at the frontier of the human rights struggle, 19 January). However, to the list of failings I would add the impact of the local authority charges that must be paid by those disabled and chronically ill people who need care in their own homes.These charges (referred to by some councils as a “contribution”) are determined by a means test. Earned income is exempt from the assessment. But welfare benefits, including most disability benefits, are taken into account. Even those with no savings at all and who are entirely dependent on benefits must pay. When benefits go up, so do the charges – a practice described by one interviewee in my recent master’s research as the state “giving it you with one hand and taking it with the other”.

Also conceding 21 shots on goal including six big chances: to be fair, that kills you. Also leaving Lauren James one-on-one with your defender, who inconveniently isn’t actually a defender: that also has a tendency to kill you. Also, the needless red card for lipping the referee. Also, not taking your own chances. Also, going into the game seven points behind in the first place. Regrettably, all fatal.Arsenal will grouse and Arsenal will grumble. Arsenal will sigh over small details and mutter deep-state conspiracies about refereeing standards. But Arsenal are also done.

The bistro is a 1930s fantasy of a neighbourhood restaurant in Pigalle, set among the guitar shops of the city’s equivalent of Tin Pan Alley or Denmark Street: a dozen tables and a well-stocked bar crowded into a tiny shopfront room; today’s wines by the glass chalked on a board (nothing over €10); a menu that changes according to what seasonal flavours chef Franck Baranger is excited about cooking; casually stylish regulars who all seem to know Martin, waiter and maitre d’, by name.Kapranos was introduced to the restaurant by the producer of Franz Ferdinand’s new album, who has a studio round the corner. He loves it here for many reasons, he says, but specifically for the everyday miracle of its Grand Marnier souffle. Before he was a rock star, Kapranos was a chef himself, most notably at Glasgow’s outpost of London’s Groucho Club, Saint Judes, so he knows what’s involved. “At Saint Judes, we used to do this thing called an inside-out chocolate pudding,” he says. “When it was perfectly executed, you had this wonderful light crust a bit like a cannoli. And then you would just tap it gently, and the whole thing would collapse in on itself and this gooey, delicious chocolate would ooze out. But to get it right was literally a margin of about 10 seconds of cooking. And if you fucked it up, that meant you had to start again. We didn’t even try souffles – but when they do them perfectly each time here, I’m still just awestruck.” Continue reading...","Sun, 26 Jan 2025 12:00:49 GMT",0.0,0.9895

They talk about tech bros, stealing hotel shampoo and four decades of combining friendship with being in a band In the video for the Manic Street Preachers’ latest single, Hiding in Plain Sight, we see bassist Nicky Wire getting ready to do his job. He sits in front of a lightbulb mirror, applies glittery eyeshadow, black eyeliner, then stands to add a feather boa, a sailor cap, a jacket covered in badges and home-sewn patches. The other two members of the Manics, guitarist James Dean Bradfield and drummer Sean Moore, along with backing singer Lana McDonagh, guitarist Wayne Murray and keyboardist Nick Nasmyth (who play in the Manics live shows) are playing their instruments. Also, because it’s the Manics, everyone’s reading books: Camus’ The Plague, Cynan Jones’s The Dig, Angharad Price’s The Life of Rebecca Jones. “The mirror is a trap that saves/Or a debt that makes you pay,” sings Wire, surrounded by Polaroids of the band when they were young: skinny, obstreperous, beautiful. “I wanna be in love /With the man I used to be/In a decade I felt free”.It’s curiously defiant, the video. “Yeah, it’s got a bit of resistance to it,” says Wire. “It’s a warped nostalgia. It’s not pretending I can go back.” Continue reading...","Sun, 26 Jan 2025 10:00:46 GMT",-0.0258,0.3191

I had a great time with my 13-year-old and her Ethiopian pal, who assured me of her skill in this department thanks to the traditionally spicy food her family eats at home.We tasted the sauces on their own and with food. Both are essential: with the first drop, you’re looking for the flavour profile and overall taste; with the second mouthful on food – in our case a margherita pizza – you’re looking for how the heat and flavour of the sauce cut through. The moment the heat from the chillies comes into contact with food, especially carbohydrates and fats, the potency is reduced and the heat is sucked up. If you want a sauce to season food and enhance its flavours, then you need more heat than is obvious, and definitely more heat than when tasting the sauces on their own.

The Guardian,How to be a foodie in 2025,"Is it still worth queueing for a croissant? What kind of flavour is ‘swicy’? And who on earth are the leguminati? Tony Naylor has the answersAs difficult as it may be to believe, there was a time when Britain was not obsessed with food. Rewind to 1984 and this phenomenon was so new that in The Official Foodie Handbook journalists Ann Barr and Paul Levy were poking gentle fun at (as Levy later wrote in the Guardian) a new breed of “perfectly sane people” who “had suddenly become obsessed with every aspect of food”.The book was not alone in identifying the foodie. By 1980, the New York magazine restaurant critic, Gael Greene, was observing the behaviour of “serious foodies”, too. But Barr and Levy, then working at Harper’s &amp; Queen magazine, certainly popularised this depiction of ardent hobbyists who bonded over artisan cheese, travelled widely to eat, dug for organic self-sufficiency or studied food’s interaction with art and literature.

O’Toole has every reason to be sincere about the humble spud. In November 2020, when she was an out-of-work chef, she made a TikTok video of her “crispy crunchy parmesan roasties”, which quickly got a million views. Since then, she has built up 4.4 million followers on TikTok, 1.1 million on Instagram, and is a regular on TV, whipping up potato dishes on Saturday Kitchen and This Morning. It is only a wonder that it has taken her so long to get around to writing an entire potato-themed cookbook. Next month’s The Potato Book is the fourth in her Poppy Cooks series. “Good things come to those who wait,” she says.I meet O’Toole for coffee in a cafe in the centre of Birmingham. “You’ll have to excuse me, I’ve got green fingers,” she says. Last night she went to a party dressed as Shrek. She grew up in the West Midlands, lives nearby, and a lot of her training was done here, first under Glynn Purnell at the recently closed Purnell’s, and then under Alex Claridge at the Wilderness. We drool over one of the city’s very best potato dishes, the aloo tuk at Opheem. “Aktar Islam knows how to respect a vegetable,” she says, admiringly. When she was writing The Potato Book, she realised that in all of her previous jobs, she’d been asked to look after the spuds. “They’d be like, ‘Oh yeah, Poppy, do dauphinoise’, or ‘Poppy, do the fondant potatoes’. Maybe I was always meant to be the potato queen.” Continue reading...","Sun, 26 Jan 2025 13:00:50 GMT",0.0,0.9821

As time has passed we have picked up family members – two new men, four new children, some light trauma – and it was decided that we should all go away somewhere to celebrate, in part, our survival. “Two weeks?” suggested my mum. “A nice day trip?” I replied. “One week?” she attempted, an entire WhatsApp group littered with debate, “In France?” Finally we agreed on a long weekend, in Portishead.It isn’t the town of Portishead exactly that lures us up the M4 towards Bristol, instead it is a house. Court House Farm is a Grade II-listed Tudor manor house recently renovated by its new owners, who have added a decorative garden and flower farm and, in an elegant barn, a jazzy little hot tub.

The Guardian,What does the inauguration’s authoritarian-chic fashion tell us? Designers are suddenly eager to dress the Trumps | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett,"The first time round, high fashion shunned the president’s family. Now  industry figures are flocking to themMussolini once said that “any power whatsoever is destined to fail before fashion. If fashion says skirts are short, you will not succeed in lengthening them, even with the guillotine.” For that reason, far-right authoritarian movements have long attempted to capture the fashion system. We can argue endlessly about whether the new Trump administration can be compared to fascism. I think that it meets most of the key traits identified by Umberto Eco, but others will disagree. Regardless of your stance, it’s fair to say that the women of the Republican party have deployed fashion in ways that send a political message.Though men especially like to highlight fashion’s supposed vapidity (tell that to Roland Barthes, I always think) it is an art form and a visual language that has much to tell us about the state of the world, and is as worthy of analysis as any other aspect of culture. The rise of the tradwife – and the modest, floral prairie dresses so beloved by these rightwing influencers, which then trickled down to the high street – has mirrored the shift in the US much further to the right. As this new administration inevitably comes to roll back more women’s rights, I wonder how it will be reflected in fashion. Prairie dresses are on the way out, but there are other styles to replace them. Continue reading...","Sun, 26 Jan 2025 11:59:03 GMT",0.3612,0.9544

The Guardian,The mind/body revolution: how the division between ‘mental’ and ‘physical’ illness fails us all,"New research shows western medicine’s traditional split between brain and body is, in fact, far from clear cut – and could provide a breakthrough for many complex conditionsSome years ago Camilla Nord suffered such persistent pain at the site of an old injury that doctors thought she would need major surgery – a joint replacement in her foot. To delay this for a few months, they injected the foot with steroids. Steroids wear off – but nearly a decade later, the pain was still much reduced. To Nord, whose day job is running the Mental Health Neuroscience Lab at the University of Cambridge, this was fascinating. Not all of her pain, it seemed, came from her foot.As Nord knew, chronic pain can cause physiological changes in the brain – a process that is now measurable in the lab. It seemed to her that her brain, as she puts it in her recent book, The Balanced Brain, “had become used to pain, monitored pain, and had begun to enhance the sensation of pain on my body”. Removing the original source of the pain for a few months had altered this process of neuroplasticity enough to make a lasting difference to the amount of pain she experienced, even after the trigger in her foot returned.

The Guardian,Ultra-processed food? Forever chemicals? Declining birth rates? What’s behind rising cancer in the under-50s?,"Research into the disease has never been more far-reaching, but there is little consensus as to what is causing the rocketing rates of diagnosis in young adultsIn 2022, around 16% of the 20 million people with cancer worldwide were under 50. Cancer has always been markedly more of an older person’s disease, says Lynn Turner, director of research at Worldwide Cancer Research. But between 1990 and 2019, the incidence of the disease in under-50s rose by 79%, according to research published in the British Medical Journal in 2023. That short timeframe means the rise cannot be explained by genetic factors, according to Tracey Woodruff, director of the University of California, San Francisco’s programme on reproductive health and the environment.Many of these “early-onset” cases are happening in wealthier countries, says Kathryn Bradbury, senior research fellow at the University of Auckland’s school of population health. The rates are striking because younger populations are mainly non-smokers, says Mary Beth Terry, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University.

Now her eldest daughter Shari is telling her side of the storyThe video doorbell footage is blurry, but you can make out the young boy approaching. He has blond hair, his legs are alarmingly skinny, duct tape is strapped to his wrists and ankles, and he is shoeless. In the background, the magnificent Red Mountains rise imperiously over the desert city of Ivins, Utah. The boy rings the bell. His voice is desperate. He asks the neighbour to take him to the police station. The neighbour tells him to take a seat, asks what is going on, then calls the police.Neighbour: “I just had a 12-year-old boy show up here at my front door asking for help and he said he just came from a neighbour’s house. He’s emaciated. He’s got tape around his legs. He’s hungry and he’s thirsty.” The neighbour, a stranger, is so upset that he starts to cry. He says it’s obvious that the boy has been held against his will and has been hurt. Continue reading...","Sat, 25 Jan 2025 10:00:19 GMT",-0.2023,-0.9109

The Guardian,Southport attacks: the failures that allowed Axel Rudakubana to kill – podcast,"The murders of three little girls in the seaside town led to horror – and then racist riots. Now the teenaged killer has been sentenced to 52 years. Josh Halliday reportsIt was hard to imagine a more unlikely place for horror to unfold than a community centre holding a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in the sleepy seaside town of Southport. So when three little girls were murdered and eight other children and two adults viciously stabbed by a 17-year-old boy, it seemed incomprehensible. But before the shock could wear off, misinformation and lies about who had unleashed this misery began to spread. The result was days of racist riots and violence.Josh Halliday, the Guardian’s North of England editor, covered the attacks, the riots and now the court case of Axel Rudakubana as he was sentenced to 52 years in prison. On Monday, as the jury was expected to be sworn in, the now 18-year-old Rudakubana shocked everyone by pleading guilty to all the charges he was faced with. And this week the judge gave him a life sentence. Continue reading...","Fri, 24 Jan 2025 03:00:44 GMT",-0.891,-0.9968

The Guardian,The big picture: a gaggle of visitors gather beneath London’s Shard,"Photographer Andy Hall​’s atmospheric new series captures the capital’s eerie financial heartFor the past seven years the Observer photographer Andy Hall has been wandering the City of London with his camera – post-Brexit, through the eerie emptiness of the pandemic and beyond – to document the changing faces of the capital’s former citadel; home to about 8,000 people, daily workplace for about 600,000 more. His pictures, now collected in a fabulous book, The Same for Everyone, examine the atmosphere and soul of the engine of the British economy, with its exposed Roman foundations and its thicket of tabloid-named towers (the Cheesegrater, the Gherkin, the Walkie-Talkie) jostling for head space above the vaults of the Bank of England.This 2023 image of a gaggle of City visitors with the peak of the Shard behind them conjures some of the airier strangeness of that landscape, in which bright minds spend long days at terminals trying to bend figures in their favour. The group here appear to have come upon this odd civilisation unexpectedly and are in search of bearings and landmarks. Continue reading...","Sun, 26 Jan 2025 07:00:43 GMT",0.0,-0.1593
