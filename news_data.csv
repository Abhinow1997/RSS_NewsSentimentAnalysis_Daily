Not to mention a section on apricots in brandy with Amanda Holden – an Alan Partridge commission waiting to happenIf nothing else, Mary Makes Christmas suggests that a very Mary Christmas is a deeply wholesome affair. There is nothing more special, says the former Bake Off judge, than making gifts for people. Personally, I am on board with this philosophy, despite what certain family members may think of their haphazard&nbsp;– let’s say “rustic” – gifts, but there are plenty of people who would rather have a PS5 than a jar of stilton dip, no matter how much love went into that cheesy sauce. It seems reasonable to assume that this is not the programme for them.Instead, it is a cosy hour of old-school, classic, Delia-style cookery, with crafting, celebrity guests billed as friends (“old and new”) and festive activities such as bellringing, swimming in the sea and carol singing, which may or may not have been filmed at a more balmy time of year. I should say, for transparency’s sake, that I have no idea when this was made – there is every chance that it was filmed last week – but nevertheless, when watching Christmas specials, I&nbsp;do enjoy wondering if everyone is having to put on a&nbsp;jumper and pretend to enjoy the taste of mincemeat as&nbsp;they sweat it out under an off-season Santa hat.

It is based on the bestselling (and initially self-published) romance series by Argentinian author Mercedes Ron, with a premise that has maybe been borrowed from Amy Heckerling’s 90s comedy classic Clueless, yet with all the humour scoured away: forbidden step-sibling romance.Noah (Nicole Wallace) is the teen daughter of a widow who has remarried a wealthy lawyer and to the dismay of these (hypocritical) elders and betters, pouting Noah falls hard for the smoulderingly hunky new stepbrother she has now acquired; this is Nick, breathily known to her as Neeeeeeeck!, as he attends to her physical needs in various upscale locations. The oldsters were forever trying to split them up in the first film and they are now at it again, brazenly setting up Neeeeeeeck! in his dad’s law firm in the hope he will fall for the sultry intern Sofia (Gabriela Andrada).

Being cleared was a win for free speechCharlotte Proudman is a barrister specialising in family law and violence against women and girlsOn Thursday, I stood in Gray’s Inn and spoke words I had hardly dared to hope I would say: “This is a victory for women’s rights and free speech.” I had been locked in a battle with my regulatory body, the Bar Standards Board, for more than two and a half years and finally it was over. I won. They had accused me, a women’s rights barrister, of five counts of professional misconduct. My so-called crime? Criticising a domestic abuse judgment on social media.I had represented a woman who alleged her husband had coercively controlled her into signing a postnuptial agreement. I argued that the high court judgment by Sir Jonathan Cohen had victim-blamed the wife, trivialised domestic abuse and pathologised her. I was accused of damaging the authority, impartiality and reputation of the entire judiciary. That’s no mean feat for a 34-year-old woman. I also said the ruling reflected a “boys’ club” attitude – at the time, the judge was a member of the then all-male Garrick Club. For that, I was accused of using gender-based, derogatory language for insinuating the judge is part of or influenced by “the boys’ club”.Charlotte Proudman is an award-winning barrister specialising in family law and violence against women and girls, founder of Right to Equality, a not-for-profit campaigning to change the law for women and children, and a research associate at the University of CambridgeDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Nissan’s mooted merger with Honda may be best answer to industry’s EV problem,"Potential deal sounds more like a credible plan for crisis-hit carmaker as its troubled alliance with Renault hits a dead end Until recently, the plan at crisis-hit Nissan was to muddle through somehow. About 9,000 job losses were announced last month out of a global workforce of 130,000. Production capacity was cut by 20%. There was some muttering about seeking a new anchor investor because the troubled 25-year alliance with Renault of France was heading up a dead end. None of it appeared to be a sufficiently radical response to a self-described “severe situation” and a plunge in Nissan’s stock market value to a clapped-out $8bn (£6.3bn).It seems its management now agrees. The new game is talks with Honda on a full-blown merger, which should probably be viewed as a takeover given that the would-be partner is worth four times as much. Either way, the potential deal sounds more like a credible plan: full consolidation creates the possibility of far deeper cost-cuts at what would be the world’s third largest car company producing 8m vehicles a year if Mitsubishi (where Nissan is a large shareholder) is also thrown into the mix.

Yet about 10,000 are now thought to be fighting for Moscow, and on Tuesday a US official reported that “several hundred” had died in Russia’s&nbsp;Kursk region.North Korea has one of the largest armies in the world, with more than 1.25 million personnel in a country of just 26 million. Despite its extraordinary nuclear and missile achievements, much of its vast stockpile of weaponry is thought to be out of date – though that hasn’t stopped it shipping as much as $5.5bn worth of arms and ammunition to Russia. The military has not engaged in large-scale combat since the end of the Korean war in 1953.

The state and capitalist system that Labour and other governments have tried to manage for the last few decades is probably beyond the conventional reforms that benefited governments and their populations in the boom years after&nbsp;the second world war.Now the voracious corporations that call the tune and expect Labour and others to dance are firmly in control. Witness the shameless manoeuvrings towards Blackstone&nbsp;et al, the Saudis and other sovereign wealth funds from&nbsp;Gulf states.

Nordhavn may be a revolutionary neighbourhood, but to say that Copenhagen is a green city is based on false premises.Near Nordhavn, a massive artificial island, Lynetteholmen, is being built that will wreak havoc on the marine environment and lead to massive amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere, and was approved by dubious means, with only 8% of the city’s population wanting it.

The Guardian,‘Speak with the manager’: Amorim responds to Rashford’s remarks on exit,"Rashford said in interview he could seek ‘new challenge’Forward likely to miss Carabao Cup trip to TottenhamRuben Amorim has said when he was a player he would have spoken to his manager about being dropped rather than react in the media, as Marcus Rashford has done. Manchester United’s head coach is undecided about how to deal with the forward, though he is believed to have left him out of the squad for Thursday’s Carabao Cup quarter-final at Tottenham.Rashford said in an interview with the journalist Henry Winter on Tuesday that he was “ready for a new challenge”. This came after the 27-year-old, who has struggled for form over the past two seasons, had been dropped for United’s 2-1 win against Manchester City on Sunday.

The Guardian,Usyk and Fury’s titanic battle flies under radar in surreal surrounds of Riyadh | Donald McRae,"These complex, contradictory heavyweights are ready to recommence hostilities – let’s hope someone tells the localsFight week in Riyadh, at least to an outsider, is an often ghostly experience. Unless you’re up close and talking to the actual fighters, to Oleksandr Usyk and Tyson Fury, or seeing them step off a parked jumbo jet to make their outrageously grand arrivals in front of a small group of local dignitaries, chattering YouTube outlets and jaded reporters, boxing feels like a mysterious rumour from the other side of the world.It’s hard to gauge how many of the seven million people who live in this vast and teeming city are even aware that Usyk will defend his world heavyweight titles against Fury on Saturday night, in a rematch of their classic first fight in Riyadh just seven months ago. I have spent hours this week in the company of various Uber drivers, as we crisscross the city, and the chattier men tend to ask two questions: where are you from? Why are you here?

The Guardian,Arsenal top WCL group after Caldentey’s late penalty settles thriller with Bayern,"Eleven games, 10 wins, one draw and top spot in their Champions League group – secured after a late Mariona Caldentey penalty powered Arsenal past Bayern Munich to end their 2024 – has left Renée Slegers’ CV looking incredibly strong.Slegers’ future is unknown, with the club yet to say whether she will stay on as interim manager, after Jonas Eidevall stepped down in October, be handed the job on a permanent basis or step aside to make way for someone new.

Not just cursory one-sentence emails, but wonderful, philosophical musings about parenting, politics, about the powerful and the powerless.When I was first published in my 20s, and quite overwhelmed by writers’ festival events, John was the steadying, kind presence that grounded me. He didn’t give a crap about prestige, he had no respect for unearned authority, and when he gave a speech he always addressed the students or young people in the room instead of the eminent adults.

The Guardian,A joyful moment on the isle of Jura: Hannah Maule-ffinch’s best photograph,"‘Grace has just jumped off the swing and her hair is all over the place but she doesn’t care. It’s a moment that encapsulates everything freeing about living on the island’Wherever I am, I always take particular interest in the way people relate to each other and their surroundings. Last spring, having just returned from Ukraine, I wanted to start a personal project a little closer to home and explore the lives of people who had done something different and come up against challenges. I looked at a few options before remembering Hugh, who employed me as a graphic designer when I was just starting out, before I got into photography.Many years after I’d moved on, Hugh moved with his dog to the isle of Jura in the Inner Hebrides, where he’d spent holidays as a kid in a tiny stone cottage rented by his family. Back then, the cottage had just been a summer retreat – there was no power and they’d boil up water on the little stove. Hugh bought the place and stayed there while he did it up. He’s been living there ever since. Continue reading...","Wed, 18 Dec 2024 16:25:06 GMT",0.8442,0.9493

The Guardian,The 50 best albums of 2024: No 3 – Billie Eilish: Hit Me Hard and Soft,"Stepping aside from her role as pop’s conscience, Eilish looks inward to tell murky love stories on her third album, and returns to her teenage flirtations with the macabre• The 50 best albums of 2024• More on the best culture of 2024As with Billie Eilish’s last album, 2021’s Happier Than Ever, Hit Me Hard and Soft opens with a state of the nation that reflects her personal experiences through the media funhouse mirror. “People say I look happy / Just because I got skinny,” she sings in a bittersweet voice as limpid, bluesy guitar rolls behind her. She wonders whether she’s already past it (she turns 23 today, 18 December), considers the trap of celebrity and laments that she’s just grist for the content mill: “The internet is hungry for the meanest kind of funny / And somebody’s gotta feed it.” Eilish has been pop’s conscience – about body image, sexualisation, industry and relationship abuse, the environment – since her teens, a role she is incredibly good at but really shouldn’t have to play. Then the song pivots, and Eilish addresses an ex, in a nightingale-like voice: “I never did you wrong.”Culpability in a breakup, and – as with the paradox in the album title – the impossibility of identifying the villain in a complex situation are the murky themes of Eilish’s third album: sometimes anguished, sometimes vindictive, always satisfyingly messy and candid. Rather than reflect generational angst (as her debut did) or the hell of teenage fame, Hit Me Hard and Soft is insular and intimate, right down to the fantastically prosaic lyric in Lunch – about her newfound desire to intimately acquaint herself with the fairer sex – where she’s “pullin’ up a chair” and “puttin’ up my hair” as she prepares to get stuck in. Lunch is an apt title: desire nourishes and depletes across these 10 songs, and by ragged epic The Greatest (as raw as any Sharon Van Etten rager), Eilish wails in frustration about “All the times I waited / For you to want me naked”, recriminating herself and her estranged lover from breath to breath.

The Guardian,The Swedish sobriety secret: dry December – and off-licences shut on a Saturday night,"For decades, the authorities in Sweden have encouraged people to drink responsibly – and with a state alcohol monopoly, strict rules and growing abstinence, they seem to be succeedingChristmas is synonymous with overindulgence, especially of drink. Sometimes the weather is an excuse: historically, alcohol was regarded as a way to warm up. Alcohol consumption traditionally increases in December in Europe and the US. Almost two-thirds of Britons say they intend to drink more at Christmas than they do at other times of the year, for example. In Sweden, however, Vit Jul (“White Christmas”) means “dry December”, a month when you don’t drink at all.Over the past 15 years, the concept of a Vit Monat (White Month) – and Vit Jul in particular – has grown in popularity in Sweden. Originally a charity idea like Sober October or Dry January, it originated as a twin project between Sweden and Finland. Now, anecdotally, more Swedes are choosing to take a “white month” in December or January. Jimmy Hemmingsson of Vega Bryggeri, one of Gothenburg’s trendy new microbreweries, says: “Maybe I’m naive to say this, but I think a lot of people want to be responsible. And family will come before drink at Christmas.” Not least, he adds, because a lot of Swedish families have long drives to visit relatives over the festive period. “We go to the country at Christmas, so that means no drinking. There is a real taboo against drink-driving.” Continue reading...","Wed, 18 Dec 2024 10:47:52 GMT",0.0,0.8766

The Guardian,"Rage, chair-throwing and sleepless nights: behind the scenes of The Jerry Springer Show","In the late 90s, Springer’s talkshow dominated the ratings with some of the most controversial stories ever told. It certainly wasn’t easy to make – but what do its producers think of it now?Is there anything The Jerry Springer Show wouldn’t do? The shock talkshow, an arena for people in love triangles to come to blows, also featured incest, white supremacists and a man who married his horse. “I did pitch a guy having an affair,” says Tobias Yoshimura, one of the show’s producers. “He was a necrophiliac. That one got shot down pretty quickly.” Perhaps not so much for matters of taste, as for the practicalities of television and any hopes of a good fight scene. The third guest – the shock reveal of the affair partner – says Yoshimura with a wry smile, “would have to be a cadaver. So that was the step too far.”The Jerry Springer Show, which ran from 1991 before finally fizzling out in 2018, started as a mundane daytime talkshow, fronted by Springer, a mild-mannered news anchor and former mayor of Cincinnati. Threatened with cancellation because of its terrible ratings, its new executive producer, Richard Dominick, took it in a sensationalist direction. It became a phenomenon and at its height in the late 90s, its ratings were bigger than Oprah Winfrey’s. Morality campaigners held protests outside the studios; many others claimed it had corroded American society. Take it further and you could argue that it is (partly) responsible for everything from the worst of reality TV to the way people behave on social media and even the rise of Donald Trump. “He took my show and brought it to the White House,” Springer said in 2019.
