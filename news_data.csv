The Guardian,MP launches legal action against Andrew Tate over social media posts,"Lawyer for Northern Ireland MP Sorcha Eastwood said posts were made the day after Commons debate on violence against women and girlsA Northern Ireland MP has launched legal action against the self-styled misogynist Andrew Tate and his brother over social media posts made in the past week. 
 A lawyer for Sorcha Eastwood, an MP for the Alliance party, said the posts were made on Friday, the day after she had told MPs that she was a “survivor of abuse” and had received rape threats.
 Kevin Winters, one of Northern Ireland’s best-known solicitors with a series of cases against the state in relation to deaths during the Troubles, confirmed he was acting for the MP. 
 “We are instructed to issue legal proceedings against Andrew and Tristan Tate over their continued publication of social media postings on 10 January 2025,” he said. 
 “We can confirm service of correspondence on today’s date to their solicitors. In light of the sensitivities of the issues engaged, we have no further comment at this stage.”
 The posts that prompted Eastwood to launch the legal action were made on social media the day after a debate on violence against women and girls in the House of Commons.Eastwood’s lawyer did not provide details of the claim but Tate’s timeline shows he commented on Friday on posts she had made in October about male role models. During the Commons debate she revealed that a member of the public had “came up and said they wanted to rape” her during a school visit she was leading at Stormont.

Last week we had 2025’s first addition to the bulging files of true-crime stories, with the documentary series about rapist and serial killer Todd Kohlhepp (The Amazon Review Killer).

All of which, I should say, is denied by Manson (real name Brian Warner) and on screen by his quietly terrifying lawyer Howard King, whose favourite expression seems to be “complete fabrication”.

The Guardian,An t-Eilean review – this Gaelic language crime drama should have happened years ago,"A high-budget series set in the Outer Hebrides – it’s hard to believe it’s taken this long, given how popular subtitled TV is. It’s a good, solid series, even if the plot stretches credulityIt is difficult to imagine An t-Eilean being made even 10 years ago. It is billed as the UK’s first ever “high-end” Gaelic drama series, which means, I think, that it was expensive to make (a report last year put it at £1m for each of its four episodes). The title translates as The Island, and it is set mostly on the Western Isles, which makes it breathtakingly beautiful and means that everyone is in possession of a good solid coat. An t-Eilean exists thanks to renewed interest in and support for the speaking of Gaelic and, with subtitles no longer being seen as a barrier to enjoyment, has a strong shot at winning over an audience far larger than the 60,000 or so fluent speakers in Scotland.Local businessman and boy-done-good Sir Douglas Maclean (Iain Macrae) is one of the richest men in Scotland, having outgrown his humble beginnings as “the proud son of a bin man”, and he and his family now live in a baronial mansion on the shoreline of Harris. The Macleans and their more loyal members of staff appear to lord it over the local people, some of whom are their tenants, and there is a distinct tension brewing between rich and poor. When Sir Douglas and his wife, Lady Mary, are attacked at home, there is one obvious suspect, and no shortage of potential others who might have been eager to dole out his comeuppance.An t-Eilean aired on BBC Alba and is on BBC iPlayer now.

Going to China while the international bond markets crept upwards was the last straw. The chancellor should resign.

So who was the cat and who made the recording? We solve the enigma of the ‘Wilhelm Miaow’There is a movie star you’ve never heard of, but whom you’ve almost certainly heard. She’s in Toy Story and Babe, How the Grinch Stole Christmas and Home Alone 3. You can catch her in Les Misérables. And if you’re a fan of being frightened, she’s also in End of Days and Pet Sematary. Once you’re familiar with her work, you start to hear her everywhere. Picture the scene: a frustrated character flings something, possibly a boot, off-camera. Perhaps we hear a bin lid clattering to the ground, and then it comes: the sound of a shocked cat screeching ferociously.You may have heard of the Wilhelm Scream. In the 1953 western The Charge at Feather River, a character named Private Wilhelm loudly yelled “Argh!” after being shot in the thigh with an arrow. This yell subsequently became an overused sound effect, appearing in Star Wars and Indiana Jones among many, many other films. Hollywood is full of similar stock noises – spooky birds, ominous thunderclaps and generic telephone rings. The one I’m talking about could perhaps be christened the “Wilhelm Miaow”.

And he’s just as keen to let themOver the past month, we’ve learned that Donald Trump’s inauguration fund has received million-dollar donations from, among others, Google, Meta overlord Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Apple boss Tim Cook. Hard to know whether it’s encouraging or quite the opposite to find them being so public about it. Traditionally when industrialists have made knee-bending gestures to incoming self-confessed authoritarians, they’ve preferred to do it in a back room somewhere, rather than on a publicly available list that also risks implying they like Carrie Underwood’s music.So let’s deal first with the entertainers. Underwood will perform at Trump’s inauguration, having previously insisted it was absolutely impossible to put her in some kind of ideological box. “I feel like more people try to pin me places politically,” she mused a few years ago. “I try to stay far out of politics if possible, at least in public, because nobody wins. It’s crazy. Everybody tries to sum everything up and put a bow on it, like it’s black and white. And it’s not like that.” Update: it now is like that.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Tue, 14 Jan 2025 16:18:08 GMT",0.4215,0.8954

Never has this been truer. There was a time when unapologetic narcissists and sociopaths thrived on reality TV. Now they all seem to be pivoting to podcasts and politics.The latest would-be politico is Andrew Tate, the British American self-styled misogynist and influencer who was humiliated by Greta Thunberg. He is suddenly very interested in becoming prime minister of Britain – which I suppose makes sense when you look at the legal mess he’s in. Tate and his brother, Tristan, are being investigated by Romanian authorities for alleged crimes including forming an organised criminal group, human trafficking, trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering. As the convicted felon and adjudicated sexual abuser Donald Trump has demonstrated, you can get away with absolutely anything as long as you’re powerful enough.

But now there is no other choiceJaron Lanier was chief scientist of the engineering office of Internet2 back in the day, which is to say, definitely one of the godfathers of the internet. In 2018, he set out the reasons to get rid of your social media in his book Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now. When I read it, I shorthanded it to: “Facebook. I really should just close down my Facebook account.” There was no way back then I would have got rid of Twitter. It was where I went to complain about Brexit, and that’s all I did. Also, seven years ago, Twitter wasn’t just porn and chatbots.Regarding Facebook, though, all Lanier’s propositions were laid out in a buffet: in politics, it creates a bias “not towards the left or right, but downwards”.

But JD Sports’ trading update will feel particularly disappointing to its shareholders because this was the second January in a row that the sportswear retailer has delivered a new year downer on profit expectations. The spiel was also identical, more or less.A year ago, the group blamed “more cautious consumer spending” and “an elevated level of promotional activity during the peak trading period”. On Tuesday it cited “a challenging and volatile market that saw increased promotional activity” as revenues fell 1.5% at established stores in November and December. The only meaningful difference is that last year offered an opportunity to whinge about the weather – too mild to flog fleeces, apparently, which wasn’t the case this time.

If these are the metrics, then Vladimir Putin’s Russia remains a democracy. Six political parties are represented in the State Duma, its federal parliament, and there are more than 20 registered political parties. Well, as you probably understand, Russia is no democracy: indeed, this is a nation veering past authoritarianism and into totalitarianism, with more Russians being persecuted for political activity than since the days of Joseph Stalin.Faith in democracy is unquestionably on the decline. A new study finds that a fifth of Britons under 45 believe that the best system for running a country effectively is “a strong leader who doesn’t have to bother with elections” compared with 8% of their older counterparts. That mirrors other findings across the world. A study by Cambridge researchers in 2020 examined attitudes in 160 countries and found that younger generations “have become steadily more disillusioned with democracy”. And according to the Pew Research Center, nearly two-thirds of citizens in 12 high-income nations were dissatisfied with democracy in 2024, up from just under half in 2017.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"The Guardian view on Rachel Reeves: turbulence caused by caution, cuts and criticism | Editorial","The chancellor isn’t going anywhere – but clinging to Treasury orthodoxy threatens Labour’s transformative growth agendaRachel Reeves’s decisions don’t warrant her departure, but her missteps are steadily eroding her credibility. She entered office with public support and was tasked with repairing a country bruised by 14 years of Conservative rule. Ms Reeves’s embrace of fiscal discipline was cast as necessary to reassure markets and prevent capital flight. But this – and her emphasis on spending cuts – points to a fundamental misdiagnosis of Britain’s problems.Sensing an opportunity, the Conservatives laid a trap and Ms Reeves walked into it. When the opposition encouraged speculation that rising bond yields would put the chancellor on track to miss her fiscal rules, the government backed “ruthless” state-shrinking as the appropriate remedial action. Ms Reeves should have immediately pointed out that the movement in long-term UK rates was down to an international shift in bond prices. She erred in thinking that claiming to be “tough” on public spending would earn her praise from the rightwing media. This lapse instead damaged her political standing, and only on Tuesday did she acknowledge her mistake, insisting global factors were largely behind rising UK government borrowing costs.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on chemical pollution: the UK can’t ignore the risks from PFAS | Editorial,"Efforts by the plastics industry to thwart regulation come from a familiar playbookAs the public wake up to the risk of “forever chemicals”, or PFAS, the industry is fighting back with a campaign researchers have compared with big tobacco’s battle against restrictions on smoking. New findings about its intense lobbying efforts are highly concerning and require a response from the environment secretary, Steve Reed. A recent consultation by the European Chemicals Agency, regarding proposals for comprehensive regulation of the substances, which take an enormous length of time to degrade, was inundated with responses from business.Varieties of these chemicals have been used in manufacturing and consumer goods since the 1950s. They protect equipment, remove grease and smooth skin – hence their appearance in kitchenware and cosmetics. But they can also leak into soil and water, and accumulate inside human tissues. Some have been linked to health problems including cancer and high cholesterol. Continue reading...","Tue, 14 Jan 2025 18:47:48 GMT",-0.5574,-0.9489
The Guardian,Keeping Gaie Delap in jail is a travesty of justice | Letters,"Readers respond to the recall to prison of a 78-year-old woman who was convicted of causing a public nuisance in a protest on the M25Zoe Williams does well to highlight the absurdity of Gaie Delap’s case (This 77-year-old climate activist should never have been jailed – and now faces a Kafkaesque struggle to get out, 9 January). Recalling a 78-year-old woman convicted of a non-violent, peaceful protest to prison on a technicality makes a mockery of our justice system.Irrespective of opinions on Delap’s activism and actions and whether she should have been given a custodial sentence in the first place, it’s clear that she has been unfairly punished by an electronic tag system that is unfit for purpose, and a judicial process that is farcically failing. And this should be of significant concern to James Timpson, the prisons minister and the chair of the recently announced Women’s Justice Board – a board that will have a remit to reduce the number of people in prison and make innovative use of technological solutions in community sentencing.

The Guardian,Anti-Al Capone tactics could work on people traffickers | Letters,"Sanctions can play an important role in deterring the operation of criminal networks, writes Alex Prezanti; plus a letter from Ian MynotI read with great interest the foreign secretary’s opinion piece announcing the development of legislation for a new sanctions regime that specifically targets irregular migration and organised immigration crime (Journal, 8 January).As a fellow barrister specialising in human rights, anti-corruption and sanctions, I am very curious about the scope and powers of the proposed law. Sanctions can play an important role in deterring the operation of criminal networks, by freezing their UK assets and cutting them off from UK financial and other services. Similar to tactics used by US prosecutors to bring down Al Capone in the 1930s, UK-based members of human trafficking networks may be easier to prosecute for violating sanctions than for the trafficking itself.

The Guardian,Jota rises to peg back Nottingham Forest after Wood gives Liverpool early scare,"Just when it seemed nothing was dropping for Liverpool in a capti­vating contest, Arne Slot turned to his substitutes’ bench midway through the ­second half and exhibited his seemingly golden touch. Kostas Tsimikas and Diogo Jota entered, the former teeing up the latter at a corner to equalise ­courtesy of their first touches and keep ­Nottingham Forest, who continue to take great pleasure at gatecrashing the title race, at arm’s length. Even if it was an imperfect night for Liverpool, it felt a significant takeaway. Jota’s header was Liverpool’s first effort on target and the first goal Forest had conceded in more than 500 minutes.For Forest, this is simply a ride supporters do not want to step off. At the final whistle their players were greeted with applause from all four corners of a throbbing stadium. This was another ­resounding display under Nuno Espírito Santo, another impressive step in an ­extraordinary season and a point lifts them to ­second, six points behind the pacesetters, who also have a game in hand. On this evidence, Forest may prove Liver­pool’s fiercest challengers, especially with both Chelsea and Manchester City dropping more points.

The Guardian,Manchester City throw away 2-0 lead as Nørgaard strikes late for Brentford,"When Brentford spurned their first couple of chances Thomas Frank showed his approval and encourage­ment with applause. But they kept ­missing them: by the end of the first half he was burrowing his head into his hands; by the time Yoane Wissa somehow shot into Nathan Aké with the goal at his mercy and 20 minutes remaining he was prostrate, forehead pressed into the turf in supplication. Maybe someone was listening.Phil Foden had opened the scoring moments earlier, and shortly afterwards he tapped in a second after Savinho’s shot was saved. If at that moment Brentford looked beaten they did not feel it, and with one final heave the pendulum swung: three minutes later Mads Roerslev’s volleyed centre found Wissa all alone on the edge of the six-yard box to pull a goal back, and in stoppage time ­Christian Nørgaard headed Keane Lewis-Potter’s right-wing cross just beyond the grasp of Stefan Ortega.

Her main role lay in training officers for surveillance work by acting as their target. She also acted as a “honey trap” in the final test before agents were sent into the field, trying to seduce them into giving away their mission.Recruited in 1943, at the age of 17, on the basis of her fluency in French, Riols was too young to be sent into France and was initially employed within F Section, preparing agents to go there. But in February 1944, she was sent to the SOE “finishing school” at Beaulieu in the New Forest, the final stage of every SOE agent’s training course, where a professional burglar taught them how to pick locks, and they were trained in the skills they would need as an agent operating on the ground constantly on the lookout for the enemy surveillance.

The Guardian,The food filter: who makes the best crunchy peanut butter?,"From Whole Earth and Meridian to supermarket staples, which is the best crunchy peanut butter, and how much do you really need to spend on it?The best tinned tomatoesI came late to the peanut butter party, and my mum remains convinced that it’s extremely unhealthy stuff, which, to be fair to her, is probably true of the sugary versions of my childhood. In the past few years, however, peanut butter has gone back to its health-food roots. It is now championed for its protein and monounsaturated fat content, as brands stripped of their sweeteners and emulsifiers have occupied the premium end of the market. Given that these new-wave natural peanut butters tend to contain nothing but peanuts – give or take the odd pinch of salt – the difference between supermarket own-label and luxury jars tends to be slight. The biggest variations are largely in the sourcing and quality of the peanuts themselves.This means that peanut butter is a handy thing to have in the cupboard at all times. Personally, I prefer a loose, crunchy consistency; for all the claims about sustainable palm oil, there’s simply no need for it in peanut butter, which, like tahini, separates naturally over time and is just as easily stirred back together. To slow the separation, simply beat the oil back in, then store the jar upside down in the fridge – assuming it lasts that long. Continue reading...","Sat, 11 Jan 2025 10:00:10 GMT",0.6369,0.7966

The Guardian,‘King of the musicools!’ Inside the outrageous musical send-up of Andrew Lloyd Webber,"It’s had hit runs in Edinburgh and Soho – and was the Guardian’s funniest show of 2024. Now it’s blazing into the West End. Comedy duo Flo &amp; Joan (who were both in Joseph at school) reveal all about One Man MusicalOne Man Musical was launched under a veil of discretion, with its creators anticipating it might not last a week. Six months on, after hit Edinburgh and Soho theatre runs, it has a six-week season in the heart of the West End. (Oh, and it was ranked the Guardian’s favourite comedy show of 2024 too.) You’d never guess from the coy title what a sensation this maiden musical-theatre offering from comedy duo Flo &amp; Joan is becoming. But a sensation it is – and will remain, unless its subject, and his lawyers, lodge a belated demand that it cease and desist.When Flo &amp; Joan – AKA sisters Rosie and Nicola Dempsey – opened the show last summer, they were tight-lipped about which “one man” their musical referred to. But with its fringe success, the cat escaped its bag: the show traces the life story, in song and soliloquy, of the “king of the musicools” Andrew Lloyd Webber. Starring comedian and actor (and a recent Hamlet at Shakespeare’s Globe) George Fouracres, in what I’ll jump the gun and call the performance of a lifetime, it begins as a seeming satire on the career of a man often dismissed as a Thatcherite purveyor of crass mega-musicals. It then develops into something more acute: part-cartoon, part-psychologically rich portrait of an artist out of his time, raging against his vast distance from the zeitgeist.

Following a licensing review last week, it can stay open – but serious questions remain around the future of the 15,000-capacity superclub, and what its struggles say about night-time culture more broadly.Enfield council’s review was triggered by the Metropolitan police, who alleged “serious failings” on the part of Drumsheds’ owners, Broadwick Live. These include failures to report two drug-related hospitalisations (one of them fatal) in October and December, another drug-related death in December, a knife being brought into the club in November, and the “uncooperative” attitude of security staff when an attender was subsequently slashed and hospitalised. Both the Metropolitan police and Enfield council declined to comment in detail on Drumsheds’ licence review, or the modified terms under which it’s been allowed to remain open.

Meanwhile, courgette, pea and sweetcorn pancakes, and cheddar and courgette muffins are other firm favourites round at Timoshkina’s: “You could add a few chopped green olives as well.”Failing that, she goes for colour: “Think something that would be appealing and exciting to the eye, and therefore likely to entice children to dig in.” Give them options and keep things customisable: “Offer a platter-style selection of fruit and veg, and pair it with cheese, a dip and crackers.” More practically, for Timoshkina that means a small cheese sandwich, crudités (carrots, celery, peppers, cucumber), hummus or guacamole, olives, nori sheets (“instead of crisps”), grapes, clementines and/or dried fruit. “If you have a bento-style box, that’s even better.”Got a culinary dilemma?

The Guardian,Tokyo drift: what happens when a city stops being the future?,"Tokyo remains, in the world’s imagination, a place of sophistication and wealth. But with economic revival forever distant, ‘tourism pollution’ seems the only viable plan The yen is low, and everybody is coming to Tokyo. If that sounds familiar, it’s not because I’m being coy or hedging my bets; it is the only information to be found in most English-language coverage of Japan’s capital in the aftermath of the pandemic. I can’t stop reading these accounts. After nine years in the country, you’d think I would have learned enough Japanese to liberate myself from the Anglo-American internet, but I’m afraid I’m stuck with flimsy stories about the tourist uptick for the time being.Part of the reason that so much coverage of the city where I live errs on the side of optimism is that Tokyo remains lodged in the postwar American imagination as a place of sophistication and wealth, good taste and cultural authenticity, with a reputation for deferential hospitality. Never mind that this was the calculated effect of bilateral postwar public relations campaigns, a boom in exportable middlebrow culture and fearmongering about Japanese industrial dominance.

Now, she returns to Hollywood in Steven Soderbergh’s Presence – and says she’s still not afraid of standing up for herselfBoredom is not a feeling with which Lucy Liu is familiar. “Sometimes I wouldn’t mind it,” she says with a smile. “But it feels nonstop. I never get bored because I don’t have time.” If there wasn’t so much to do, she says: “I’m sure I could learn a language, you know, learn how to ride a unicycle. I mean, come on, the list is endless. So it never feels, like ‘What’s left?’ It’s ‘Where do we start?’” Liu is not someone who likes to look backwards. “I think my best work is ahead of me,” says the actor who has done blockbusters (2000’s Charlie’s Angels and its sequel), two Quentin Tarantino movies (Kill Bill Vols 1 &amp; 2), performed on Broadway, shared top billing on a hit TV show (Sherlock Holmes update Elementary, playing a female Watson), all after receiving her big break on another, era-defining series (Ally McBeal).Liu’s latest film is Presence, one of Steven Soderbergh’s more experimental works. Although nominally a horror, it’s weirder than that, being shot from the perspective of a ghost who watches a new family move into a house. “He’s truly an artist, because he’s willing to experiment and not really afraid to fail,” says Liu of the director. She has been a fan of Soderbergh’s since his 1989 breakthrough Sex, Lies, and Videotape. “I feel like it [Presence] is coming from a very clear place of curiosity, which I enjoy, because that is artistic freedom, isn’t it? You’re not doing it for ‘the Man’. It’s something you are curious about so then you just try it. It’s almost childlike.” The film has little dialogue, and little backstory. Liu’s character is the mother of two teenagers, and there is clearly tension within the family, not least because she seems to favour her son over her daughter. Sometimes there are scenes, in the ghost’s watchful presence, where nothing appears to happen, which feels a little destabilising to a modern audience used to fast cuts and spoon-fed exposition. “We’re so used to being told what to look at, what to do or feel,” says Liu.
