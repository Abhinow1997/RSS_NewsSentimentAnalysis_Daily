The Guardian,NHS trusts declare critical incidents due to ‘exceptionally high demands’ in A&E,"Hospitals in Birmingham, Cornwall and Liverpool among those affected, with one patient forced to wait 50 hours to be admittedA number of NHS trusts have declared critical incidents due to “exceptionally high demands” in emergency departments, with a patient at one hospital forced to wait 50 hours to be admitted to a ward.
 Hospitals in Birmingham, Cornwall, Hampshire, Liverpool, Northamptonshire and Plymouth have declared critical incidents.
 East Sussex hospitals trust announced it is temporarily limiting visiting to one visitor per patient per day to reduce the impact of flu.
 It said in a statement: “This includes those accompanying people waiting in our emergency department.
 “Exemptions apply to end-of-life care, our special care baby unit and when visiting children under 16. Additional visitors will be permitted on compassionate grounds on a case-by-case basis for all of our other services.”
 East Midlands ambulance service NHS Trust also declared the first critical incident in its history due to a combination of “significant patient demand, pressure within local hospitals and flooding”.
 The health secretary, Wes Streeting, has said he feels “ashamed” at the experiences of some NHS patients, admitting that some are being taken to hospital “to die” because the right care is not available.
 He said he felt “emotional” hearing about long waits and patients being passed from ambulance to ambulance, and also acknowledged that flu is a “big problem” and was causing “extraordinary pressure” in hospitals.
 Speaking on LBC Radio, Streeting said: “It breaks my heart because … I’ve seen this when I’ve been shadowing the ambulance service on ride-outs – we are taking people in ambulances to emergency departments to die because then there isn’t the right care available at the right time in the right place, including end-of-life care.”
 The overall weekly hospital admission rate for influenza increased to 14.09 per 100,000 population in the week ending 29 December 2024, compared with 10.69 per 100,000 the previous week, and 8.72 per 100,000 the week before that.
 Dr Adrian Boyle, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the PA news agency: “This flu season is not an outlier, but the problem is our emergency care system is so overwhelmed and fragile that a normal flu season – which is what we’ve got at the moment – is creating severe operational difficulties.”
 He added: “It is a significant flu outbreak, but the problem is there’s just no capacity to deal with it. So it is really a straw that is breaking the camel’s back.”The Royal Liverpool University hospital remains in a critical incident state following an announcement by NHS University Hospitals of Liverpool group on Monday evening.
 The longest time one patient waited to be admitted to a ward at the hospital was 50 hours, it is understood.
 Four NHS trusts declared critical incidents – Hampshire hospitals NHS foundation trust, University hospitals Plymouth NHS trust, University hospitals Birmingham NHS foundation trust and NHS Northamptonshire integrated care board. Continue reading...","Tue, 07 Jan 2025 23:31:29 GMT",0.2023,0.7949

The Guardian,‘I was drenched in painting’: how Jake Grewal’s nudes in nature caused a sensation,"His dreamy, mysterious landscapes populated by naked figures have made him a rising star of the art world. But the young artist says he’s still figuring things outWhen Luca Guadagnino began thinking about posters for his latest film Queer, in which Daniel Craig plays an American expat picking up men in Mexico City, one artist immediately sprang to mind. The director had been following Jake Grewal for several years, quite taken with his intensely personal romanticism. Grewal, in turn, had been quite taken with Guadagnino’s Call Me By Your Name. So it was a meeting of minds. “I showed Luca this painting,” says Grewal, gesturing to a beautiful canvas depicting two embracing figures. “And he said, ‘That’s amazing. It’s basically my film!’”Grewal’s ghostly sketch now features on special edition posters for Queer, ostensibly portraying the film’s main protagonists, Craig and Drew Starkey, in a moment of closeness, of even merging into one – perhaps after they’ve taken ayahuasca, the film being loosely based on William S Burroughs’ 1985 novella of the same name. The director rightly identified such intimacies as a constant theme of Grewal’s work, in which feelings of absence and longing infiltrate his depictions of naked male figures, lost in nature or at one with it.

Gaza’s health ministry said on Monday that at least 45,854 have now died there in the 15 months since the Hamas attacks in southern Israel.The crisis is so familiar and relentless now that international attention has flagged. And yet it is so desperate that the facts must be reiterated. At least seven infants have died from the cold in recent weeks. Almost the entire 1.9m population has been displaced, in most cases repeatedly. They are exhausted and traumatised. An estimated 91% face high levels of acute food insecurity, according to the UN.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on the Church of England after Welby: adapt to survive | Editorial,"Appointing the first female archbishop of Canterbury would be a good start, amid a crisis of trust and directionJustin Welby’s last day in post as archbishop of Canterbury, on Monday, was spent privately at Lambeth Palace where he attended two services on the&nbsp;feast of the Epiphany. Following evensong, Mr&nbsp;Welby symbolically laid down his bishop’s crozier, creating a vacancy at the head of the Church of England which is unlikely to be permanently filled until the autumn. His low-key and downbeat departure leaves behind a church facing a deeply bleak midwinter.Most obviously and most urgently, confidence in the&nbsp;church’s hierarchy over safeguarding issues is at rock bottom following the publication of the independent review into its handling of the case of John Smyth – a serial and sadistic abuser of children over decades. Mr&nbsp;Welby’s decision to resign over the matter, given the review’s damning criticism of his failure to grip the&nbsp;scandal, was the right one. But subsequent calls for&nbsp;the&nbsp;archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, to resign, over a separate abuse case, underline the need for root-and-branch reform of in-house safeguarding structures.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,So much for the dream of buying a family home | Letters,"John Worrall, Ed Brierley and Will Wright respond to an article by Kirsty Major on the struggles many face to climb the property ladderKirsty Major (Meet the young families stuck in their starter homes thanks to the UK housing crisis, 3 January) describes a financialised housing market in which a decade and a half of interest rates close to zero, along with George Osborne’s outrageous help-to-buy policy, pushed prices from a mortgageable three or four times average earnings to more than nine times. It is now one where those with inherited property wealth or the Bank of Mum and Dad (the UK’s sixth largest lender) might compete, but those without mostly cannot. And so the social divide widens.But then Keir Starmer says he will back “the builders not the blockers”, implying that supply will fix affordability. That would need developers to increase it to the point where they had to drop prices and then keep building – and incurring losses – while prices continued to fall. Obviously they won’t do it. It is deeply concerning that Starmer and Angela Rayner don’t acknowledge that. Continue reading...","Tue, 07 Jan 2025 16:59:01 GMT",0.25,-0.6288
The Guardian,Jimmy Carter proved that decency in politics is possible | Letter,"The underrated quality isn’t consigned to a bygone era and can flourish again the public sphere, says Rev Mike CorcoranReflections on the former US president Jimmy Carter’s character in stark contrast to President-elect Trump make sober reading (Jimmy Carter’s death comes at a time when rancour and uncertainty prevail, 30 December). With only days to go before the return to the politics of chaos in the US, I believe that many Americans (and indeed many people across the globe) still highly value decency.While I accept that in recent years in both the UK and US, decency has come under fire (and become unfashionable), surely we owe it to the next generation not to accept the narrative that indecent politics is the norm and the only way to get things done.

The Guardian,Newcastle on verge of Carabao Cup final after famous win at Arsenal,"The irony will surely not be lost on Mikel Arteta. On a night when his side were hoping to put one foot in the Carabao Cup final, it was Alexander Isak– a striker that the Arsenal manager has long coveted – who did the damage as Newcastle secured a famous victory.It was no less than Eddie Howe’s side deserved as they bid to reach the final once again after the heartache of losing to Manchester United at Wembley in 2023. Goals either side of half-time from Isak – his 10th in his last nine appearances – and Anthony Gordon ensured they will go into next month’s second leg at St James’ Park with a healthy advantage. While Arsenal had 23 chances in total, only three were on target and there was no need for the referee John Brooks to explain any video assistant referee decisions to the crowd in an initiative being trialled in the semi-finals as the hosts struggled to respond after falling behind. They left the pitch to a smattering of boos from those supporters who remained at the end and Arsenal’s hopes of winning a second major trophy since Arteta took charge now look distant. But Newcastle’s fans – who serenaded Howe and his players after the final whistle – can almost start to plan another trip to London in March.

For a man whose record of seven F1 world titles is matched only by Michael Schumacher, and whose total of 105 grand prix wins is unequalled, he will step into one of the red cars for the first time knowing that he has everything to prove – and not just to the Italian team’s global army of supporters.Obstacles and challenges are nothing new to Hamilton, who has been listening to criticism from the day he first ventured into a historically all-white sport, a mixed-race child whose father worked three and sometimes four jobs at a time to pay for his kart racing.

Now these giant domed jails, which date back to the 1700s, are being turned into creative centres – complete with cells for rent and escape roomsOne of the architectural features that marks out the skyline of Haarlem, a small Dutch city, is a 37.6m-high dome, crowning a rotunda. You might assume it was built for religious purposes – until you notice the bars covering its 230 windows.​​Operating as a prison from 1899 until 2016, the Koepelgevangenis (“dome prison”) is one of three panoptic penitentiaries built in the Netherlands. All were shut down in the past decade as part of the country’s drive to reduce its prison population and are now being repurposed as arts venues.

The Guardian,‘There is sure to be drama’: Grant Mitchell’s genius EastEnders comeback,"The evil brother is back! For the soap’s 40th birthday, he’ll be leaving his Portuguese villa to wreak havoc in the Square for the first time since 2016. What a brilliant ideaThere are certain headlines that people dream about. “Inflation remains at record low”. “January heatwave on the way for the UK (but don’t worry, the climate crisis is sorted)”. For me, it’s: “Grant Mitchell is returning to EastEnders”.As a soap fan who grew up in the 1990s, some of my earliest TV memories are of Grant’s trademark blend of psychopath and what I believe soap magazines used to describe as “womaniser”. One of the most well-known British television characters of the decade, Grant reached icon status as half of the Mitchell brothers and a third of “Sharongate”. (For anyone reading who was born after 1988, this was when Grant discovered wife Sharon was having an affair with brother Phil and promptly tried to murder him.)This article was amended on 7 Jan 2025 to remove reference to the Mitchell brothers being twins.

A new collection, Myself and Other Animals, traces the origins of his lifelong rapture with animalsAs a toddler, Gerald Durrell was on a walk when he peered over the side of the road and spotted two creatures. “They were gently sliding over each other in what looked like a dance. They were a pale coffee colour with black, ridged stripes. They were glutinous and beautiful”.This rather flattering description of two slugs writhing in a ditch opens a new collection of writings by the beloved conservationist, who died in 1995 and would have turned 100 today, and it sets the tone for the book: all animals should be considered miraculous, conventional looks aside.

The Guardian,The anxiety secret: how the world’s leading life coach stopped living in fear,"Famous for her work with Oprah Winfrey, Martha Beck is a bestselling author and self-help superstar. But for 60 years she was anxious and terrified - until she found a simple, uplifting answerAll her life, Martha Beck had been anxious, but a few years ago she began to get really curious about anxiety. And curiosity, she wants us all to know, may just be the path out of paralysing, life-spoiling terror. During the pandemic, Beck – a bestselling author and life coach – started looking deeper into anxiety in order to help her clients. It was something she thought she knew about, having experienced it throughout her life, and over the years she had followed the standard advice: she had practised meditation for 30 years, and been on medication, but now Beck was starting to wonder if inner peace was as far as it went.Instead of trying to control her anxiety, Beck started to befriend it: “I started treating myself like a frightened animal and doing for myself what we all instinctively know will calm a frightened animal.” Imagine, she says, “you found a freezing, dirty puppy on your doorstep, and you decided you wanted to help it. What would you do? Get down on its level, speak to it kindly and softly. Don’t try to explain to it what it needs to do next – it’s an animal. Allow it to be afraid while regarding it with compassion.” When she tried this on herself, Beck says she could “dramatically feel this shift in my psychology, my body and my brain”. And then, she says with a laugh, “I got into creativity and things got really weird.” Continue reading...","Tue, 07 Jan 2025 10:00:05 GMT",-0.7003,0.5565
The Guardian,How to make chips without potatoes | Kitchen aide,"Parsnips, beetroot and cassava all make great chips, say our culinary expertsIt’s hard to deny the allure of a big ol’ pile of hot, fat, crisp, salty chips, but with the festive season finally over, now is a time to ring the changes. And if that means swapping your spuds for another veg, so be it. For a good chip alternative, “any fibrous root vegetable that can hold its shape will fry up a treat”, says Alice Zaslavsky, author of Salad for Days, but you don’t necessarily have to fry them: “You can roast them, or you can cook them in an air fryer. As long as there’s enough oil and a high enough temperature, you’re good to go.”Sweet potatoes are the obvious alternative, but they have a higher moisture and sugar content, and have form for turning soggy or just plain burning. “If you want to get them lovely and crisp, make sure they are cut into similar-sized pieces, then toss in a little cornstarch [about one tablespoon per kilo] before adding oil,” says Christina Soteriou, author of Big Veg Energy. Just don’t use too much of the latter: “That can make them go soggy, so just barely coat them.”Got a culinary dilemma?

Many plants and animals are evolving in response, adapting to a human-dominated world. One notable example came during the Industrial Revolution, when the peppered moth turned from black and white to entirely black after soot darkened its habitat. The black moths were camouflaged against the soot-covered trees, surviving to pass on their genes to the next generation.As human influence has expanded, so too have the strange adaptations forced on the natural world.

The Guardian,The man making a business out of China’s burnout generation,"Li Jianxiong was a highflying marketing executive in Beijing until a breakdown sent him to the west on a wellness voyage of discovery – just as his peers were losing faith in the Chinese DreamLi Jianxiong is convinced he has lived two lives. His first began in 1984, when he was born to impoverished farmers in China’s Henan province. Ambitious and daring, he took full advantage of the new economic reality that unfolded after the cataclysms of the Mao years. By 2017, he had secured a family, a house in Beijing and a reputation as one of China’s most talented young marketing men. His success, however, came at a cost. By then, China had become notorious for its “996” work culture – 9am to 9pm, six days a week – but Li was working something closer to 007: 24 hours a day, every day. While managing an all-consuming media crisis for his employer, a major tutoring company, he developed insomnia, heart palpitations and a severe rash that doctors attributed to a flagging immune system. He wondered more than once whether he might actually work himself to death.In Li’s telling, his second life began in 2018, when he left his lucrative job. Feeling broken and beleaguered, he treated himself as an experiment in self-rescue. He dabbled in Freud, read around in positive psychology, and familiarised himself with the writings of the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh. He absorbed biographies of Gandhi and Mother Teresa. He travelled to sacred Taoist sites in Hubei, an ecological healing village in Guizhou, a Buddhist charity house headquartered in Taiwan. He even moved to the US for a time, where he attended Christian self-development retreats and studied religion at Columbia University. Continue reading...","Tue, 07 Jan 2025 05:00:54 GMT",0.0,0.8806

It reflects the fact that Moore has often been recognised for everything except her acting: her beauty, body, dress sense, salary, box office and love life. All of which makes her rehabilitation and recognition truly satisfying. In her acceptance speech, she spoke of having been branded a “popcorn actress” by a producer 30 years ago – commercially successful but unworthy of acclaim.
