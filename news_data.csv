But then few buildings are as slender, stripped back and meticulously honed as those designed by Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa, founders of the Japanese practice Sanaa, who have been announced as this year’s recipients of the RIBA royal gold medal for architecture.They have built a house in Tokyo with the delicacy of a cardboard model, where the internal walls are just 16mm thick. Their outpost of the Louvre museum in northern France, which shimmers on the horizon like a foggy apparition, features 25-metre- long steel roof beams that are just 12mm wide.

The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Bomber dies in attack on army recruitment centre,"String of attacks against Ukraine’s mobilisation effort; Ukraine announces robot ground units. What we know on day 1,079A person died setting off an explosion at an army recruitment centre in western Ukraine on Wednesday, officials said, amid a string of attacks against the mobilisation effort. The explosion at the Kamianets-Podilsky recruitment centre wounded four other people, said Sergiy Tyurin, the regional administrator. Ukrainian police said it was the ninth such attack on a recruitment centre this year, and alleged the perpetrator had been recruited by Russian agents. In all cases, the perpetrators had been detained. A person who set off a blast on Saturday at a draft centre in Rivne, north-west Ukraine, was also killed in the explosion, with six others wounded, police said. Also on Saturday, a man with a hunting rifle shot dead a Ukrainian army recruitment soldier and escaped with a conscript before both were caught by police.Russia and Ukraine each said on Wednesday that 150 of their captured soldiers had been returned in a prisoner-of-war exchange. “Some of the guys had been in captivity for more than two years,” said the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Russia confirmed the swap, mediated by the United Arab Emirates, which has helped broker many such exchanges.Ukraine’s military will create robotic vehicle units to deploy at the front, the defence minister, Rustem Umerov, said on Wednesday. “Our goal is to create a military where innovative technologies help perform the most dangerous tasks, saving the lives of our defenders,” he said. The ministry published a photograph of a robotic vehicle with a gun mounted on it. With both sides deploying tens of thousands of airborne drones each month, a race is on to replace as many soldiers on the ground as possible with unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), officials say.Russian attacks on Wednesday killed two people near the frontline in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region and one near the Black Sea port of Odesa, officials said.
 Emergency services said a house was shelled in the town of Druzhkivka, south of the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk region, killing two people. The Odesa regional governor, Oleh Kiper, said a missile attack killed one man and badly injured another outside an unfinished building near the port.Germany is investigating whether vandalism aimed at hundreds of cars that was widely blamed on climate activists may have been a Russian pre-election campaign seeking to smear the Greens party. No German prosecutors or officials have confirmed that Russia is thought to be behind the campaign, but the foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, a Green, said: “Whoever stands against Russia’s illegal war of aggression comes into the crosshairs of the Kremlin and its henchmen.” Prosecutors in the southern city of Ulm said four people aged between 17 and 29, from countries including Romania, Serbia and Bosnia were suspected of involvement in more than 100 incidents in which car exhaust pipes were blocked with self-hardening industrial spray foam.The US vice-president, JD Vance, will be at the Munich security conference next week where discussions will be held focused on national security issues, including Russia’s war in Ukraine.The leading French newspaper Le Monde on Wednesday denounced the “disguised expulsion” of its Moscow correspondent Benjamin Quenelle, after his press accreditation was revoked. Since starting the war, the Kremlin has thrown domestic journalists and several western reporters in jail and severely restricted war coverage. Le Monde’s editorial director, Jerome Fenoglio, said: “This arbitrary decision constitutes a new obstacle to the freedom of the press in the country … Even in the tensest moments of the cold war, Le Monde pursued its work in Moscow and beyond.” Russia’s foreign ministry said it was in retaliation for France’s refusal to issue press visas to journalists from Komsomolskaya Pravda whom Paris accuses of being Russian agents.

It’s good to be back in hellAmandaland begins, in time-honoured Motherland fashion, under pressure on the school run. Except we’re not in Chiswick – we’re now in south Harlesden, Amanda is driving a Tesla for ever on the brink of running out of battery, and Georgie and Manus, who aren’t so little any more, have been forced to move school after the collapse of Mummy’s ruthlessly Hygge-Tygge’d life. Cue a pep talk by the worst, by which I mean the best, Motherland mother of all. “I’m a people person,” says Amanda. “And&nbsp;historically our people are people people. So get out there and&nbsp;find your people!”Ah, it’s good to be back in hell. Spin-offs are always a risk, but Lucy Punch’s Amanda was a sure bet. Sorry, team Liz, but she was the best character in Motherland: the ideal Sharon-Horgan-sharpened instrument for impaling the worstexcesses, blind spots and hypocrisies of the posh, white, west London middle classes. By the end of the third and last series, Amanda had perversely become the cruel heart of the show. I felt actual compassion for her when she did that dance at the PTA fundraiser that got 400 TikTok likes. Weird, I&nbsp;know, but that’s what satire at its most skewering can do. It makes you care.

A moment when you have to ask yourself: what the hell just happened?And no doubt we can expect many more such days in the next four years if the US president maintains his Maga “speak first, think later” persona.

The Guardian,The rise and fall of Emilia Pérez: how did it all go so wrong for the Oscar-nominated film and its star?,"Less than two weeks ago, the movie was flying high, with 13 Academy Award nods. Then came a social media scandal and a serious backlashYou can generally tell when awards season is going well for a movie because its stars are everywhere, attending galas, treading red carpets, doing as many interviews as they can, and repeating the same bland sentiments about how special this movie is and everyone was a dream to work with. Conversely, you can tell things aren’t so rosy when your lead star is cancelling all their US appearances, being discreetly airbrushed out of the campaign and issuing statements such as: “I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain.”This is where Emilia Pérez and its lead, Karla Sofía Gascón, find themselves. Less than two weeks ago the movie was riding high, with a remarkable 13 Oscar nominations, including best actress for Gascón – the most for any movie this year and one short of the all-time record. Now, though, it is looking as if the wheels have come off for Emilia Pérez’s awards campaign, or at least for Gascón herself. Many are wondering how this could have happened so quickly; was it a spectacular act of self-sabotage, or are there darker arts at work?

The Guardian,"Trump’s Gaza plan has staggered the world. Did he mean it? For now, that doesn’t matter | Martin Kettle","The president’s appalling threat to seize Gaza and drive out its people imperils global stability, even if he never deploys a single US soldierThe comments were brazen, swaggering, jaw-dropping, audacious, and, to many, simply outrageous. “Stupéfaction mondiale” was how the French paper Libération responded on Wednesday morning. The sober-sided New York Times contented itself with “improbable”. A US senator gave voice to what will surely become a drumbeat charge across the Middle East and beyond in the hours and days to come, that what Donald Trump had said about Gaza amounted to “ethnic cleansing by another name”.On Tuesday, at the end of his White House meeting with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, President Trump declared that the US should seize control of the Gaza Strip and permanently remove its 2.2 million Palestinian inhabitants to resettlement in places such as Egypt and Jordan. The US would “own it and be responsible”, said Trump. “We’ll take it over and develop it,” he added. There would be “unlimited numbers of jobs and housing” for “the people of the area” – though which people they would be was not specified. Gaza would be turned into “the Riviera of the Middle East”.

The Guardian,What the Labour left should learn from new revelations about Starmer’s path to power | Owen Jones,"If Starmer is the hapless patsy of a Labour right that has no answers to Britain’s many crises, progressives must organise before Reform triumphsIt was clear from the outset that Keir Starmer’s Labour would win the election by default, then prove a fiasco in power. Starmer’s ratings are now worse than Rishi Sunak’s at his nadir, and Nigel Farage’s Reform – a party with just five MPs – appears to be edging ahead of the party of government in the polls. So far, this government has spent its time clobbering pensioners, being showered with freebies by well-heeled donors and damaging economic confidence with ill-judged post-election doom and gloom, followed by a panicked “growth above all else” reverse ferret. Just months after securing power, the prime minister’s own staff briefed two Times journalists that they had no idea what he really believed, and that he wasn’t really running the country – that he’d been deceived into thinking he was “driving the train”, when he’s really been sat at the front of the driverless Docklands Light Railway.It’s almost enough to make you pity Starmer – imagine publicly humiliating the prime minister you are paid to work for just months after winning power? – until you remember that he appointed this backstabbing rabble in the first place. The published excerpts from Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogrund’s new book, Get In: The Inside Story of Labour Under Starmer, lay out the strategy of this rightwing faction. “Occasionally they even spoke of their leader as if he were a useful idiot,” they write. “Keir acts like an HR manager, not a leader,” his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, is quoted as saying. They saw Starmer as a convenient empty vessel, whom they could deceive a Corbynite Labour membership into voting for, then use their yes-man to permanently bury the left before replacing him with a true believer, the ultra-Blairite Wes Streeting. Alas, the Tories managed to implode and the man they see as a useful idiot sits in No 10, pretending to drive a train.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Wed, 05 Feb 2025 10:00:35 GMT",0.0,-0.7232

The Guardian,Why am I so sad about seeing a robot get beaten up? | Adrian Chiles,"I watched a video showing three men kick, hit, then topple the poor humanoid. All I wanted to do was take the poor thing by the hand and lead it to a better lifeI saw a clip of a robot being pushed and shoved around by three men. I found it most unsettling. They bully it rather tentatively, without great violence. They find it amusing, until it falls over, at which point it’s the price of the thing that seems to be the worry. This AI humanoid apparently cost $70,000 (£55,800). It’s in the care of one Kai Cenat, an internet-type person – streamer, YouTuber, influencer – you know the kind of thing. Doing the bullying were Cenat and two other gentlemen by the names of Agent and Fanum. I take it they’re in a similar line of business. The incident shown took place in the AMP house. According to Google this is either an office building in east Croydon, or the home of a group of internet celebrities living together in a house in Atlanta, Georgia. I’m plumping for the latter.I wonder why I find myself caring about this machine. Surely it’s as daft as feeling sorry for the red Austin 1100 Basil Fawlty beat with a bit of tree, which I never did. In fact, on reflection, I might also have felt sorry for the tree, but didn’t. That said, I do have a capacity for strong feelings about inanimate objects. On more than one occasion I upset the children by choosing the most pitiable-looking Christmas tree in the shop. I just couldn’t bear the thought of it lying there on Christmas Eve, cold, unbought, unloved, undecorated, bauble-less. A waste of a life. I’ve had similar feelings for kitchen implements and even an easily replaceable Oyster travelcard which I’d managed not to lose for a long time – until I lost it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As usual, Trump began his speech by listing all his so-called achievements in the region – many illegal under international law – of his previous term, including the moving of the US embassy to Jerusalem, recognition of Israel’s unlawful annexation of the Syrian Golan, and the Abraham Accords. Once he finished bestowing accolades upon himself, he presented his administration’s future plans for Gaza.Yara Hawari is co-director of Al Shabaka, the Palestinian Policy NetworkDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,GSK delivers a syringe full of crowd-pleasers | Nils Pratley,"Pharmaceuticals company’s higher dividend, upgrade to revenues and share buyback suggest its drugs pipeline is flowing nicelyYou could have made good money during Dame Emma Walmsley’s eight years as chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline by buying the shares whenever they fell to £13 and shorting them whenever they hit £18. The yo-yo pattern has repeated three or four times. Optimism breaks out regularly, but something always turns up to spoil the mood.Lockdown during the Covid pandemic meant patients couldn’t get out for their shingles jabs, a critical product for GSK. When that cloud cleared, an enormous legal wrangle over Zantac, a heartburn drug from the 1990s, appeared. The settlement was financially tolerable in the end, but last year’s downer was the US regulator’s decision to limit the age range for use of a new vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for older adults, quickly followed by the appointment of vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy as the US secretary of health and human services. The shares, having touched £18 in May 2024, were once again at £13 by November. Continue reading...","Wed, 05 Feb 2025 17:40:29 GMT",0.0,0.6746
The Guardian,No one is safe from Trump’s racist agenda | Bakari T Sellers,"Trump’s attacks on civil rights don’t just affect people of color, they reach other citizens as wellI found myself cheating on CNN, where I’m a political commentator, with MSNBC last weekend. I just had to watch my friend, Nikole Hannah-Jones, articulate a great point that many have missed: Donald Trump is pursuing a racial agenda, not an economic one.This isn’t historically novel. Most progress is met by this kind of backlash – from the “Red Shirts” and Klansmen who used brutal violence against Black citizens following the gains of the Reconstruction era, to the voting restrictions that followed the election of Barack Obama. But this time is different. Continue reading...","Wed, 05 Feb 2025 12:00:37 GMT",-0.5106,-0.2152
The Guardian,"As Labour touts more brutal cuts to benefits, how is this different from life under the Tories? | Frances Ryan","There may be no nasty impulse to punish ‘skivers’, but the end result – those who need help most hit hardest – is exactly the sameWhen Rachel Reeves pledged last week that a third runway at Heathrow would put money in the pockets of “working people”, the chancellor gave a bigger hint about the government’s plans than the headlines suggested. The phrase didn’t just claim that the economic benefit of big-money infrastructure projects would somehow trickle down to workers struggling to pay the rent. It implied that anyone who didn’t do their duty for the labour market – say, people too disabled or ill to work, family carers and jobseekers – should expect very little from Labour.Such sentiments could be dismissed as empty rhetoric, of course, but by all accounts are actually a preview. In the autumn budget, Reeves committed to keeping the £3bn of disability benefit “savings” the outgoing Conservative government planned. It is now expected that a package of spending cuts will be finalised in the next fortnight, in what the Times describes as a “radical overhaul of welfare” that could see hundreds of thousands of disabled and chronically ill people lose their benefits.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Trump’s foreign policy: an alarming new order takes shape | Editorial,"The US’s former allies must not normalise or legitimise the president’s lawless concept of international deal-makingNothing about Donald Trump’s notion that Gaza should come under US control makes sense according to established laws and norms of international relations. But the current White House regime despises the old way of doing things and intends to reshape the world so drastically that restoration of a pre-Trumpian order will be impossible.The absurd incoherence of Mr Trump’s proposal that the US “take over” Gaza doesn’t make it any less sinister. The requirement that 2.2 million Palestinians be forcibly resettled in neighbouring Arab states amounts to unambiguous endorsement of a criminal atrocity – ethnic cleansing.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on class politics: it has faded as culture wars have risen | Editorial,"As economic inequality deepens, political leaders continue to side-step structural issues while extremists aim to claim the votes of the left behindEarly in the 2010s, class politics was everywhere. Bankers were bailed out, and the price Europeans apparently had to pay was austerity. Protests erupted from Greece to Wall Street. Thomas Piketty’s book on inequality, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, took the world by storm, and Britain seemed poised for a shift – first with Ed Miliband’s critique of “predatory capital”, then when Labour members chose to back Jeremy Corbyn’s attack on a rigged economy.A decade later, it might seem that time’s arrow has finally hit its mark. Britain has a Labour government with a whopping majority and, after years in which British prime ministers hopped off the conveyor belt from Eton or Winchester, the country is now led by the&nbsp;son of a toolmaker. Even the leader of the Tories, Kemi Badenoch, claims she “became working class” as&nbsp;a teen, while doing a few shifts at McDonald’s.

What is often conveniently forgotten is that Agincourt (1415) was a strictly English victory. Scotland was on the other side, allied with France. Naming a vessel of the British Royal Navy after a defeat for a significant part of Britain seems odd, to say the least.If the Royal Navy was minded to name a vessel Agincourt, perhaps it could restore the balance by calling another one Castillon, the 1453 Auld Alliance rout of a much larger English force that brought an end at last to the hundred years war.

I went to a wedding and could hear bombs and alarms going off’I grew up in Ahvaz, a city in Iran that’s close to the border with Iraq, during the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88. I have a memory of going to a wedding party as a child and hearing bombs and alarms – I didn’t fully understand what was happening, or why the bride looked nervous, but there was a paradoxical feeling of still wanting to spend our time in the happiness of that moment.This photograph reconstructs that memory. It was shot at a location used for making movies about the war: a huge place in the desert where they have all the necessary props. Getting permission wasn’t easy but I wanted to tell my story there, sketching normal life events – weddings, birthdays, Iranian new year – into a war zone. The series, from 2008, is titled Today’s Life and War, and it reflects my interest in the relationship between war and everyday life. I often explore themes of displacement, survival and human resilience in my work. Creating this series helped me process the emotions and memories of growing up in wartime. Many people who lived through it told me they connected to these images because they show struggle and survival. Continue reading...","Wed, 05 Feb 2025 15:22:36 GMT",0.0772,-0.8945

The Guardian,I loved Pokémon Trading Card Pocket – until I didn’t,"​Some games are meant to be played forever, but you have to know when to pull the plug, even if you haven’t finished itFor months now I have been in the thrall of Pokémon Trading Card Pocket. It’s a devilishly slick blend of card-collecting and pared-down battling that has had me obediently opening the app on my phone at least twice a day since it launched. The virtual cards are beautifully done; the rare art cards especially, with their pastoral scenes of Pokémon in their natural habitats. I have spent many hours on the battles, too, honing decks and chasing win streaks to earn myself victory emblems. I got most of my friends into it, anticipating the day when its makers at DeNa would finally enable trading so I could fill the last couple of holes in my collection.This week, on the day that the trading went live and an expansion full of pretty new cards was introduced, I quit. I made a couple of trades for the Venosaur Ex and Machamp Ex that had evaded my grasp despite opening hundreds of packs, took a screenshot of the “collection complete” screen, and I haven’t opened it since. I’m done. Continue reading...","Wed, 05 Feb 2025 15:00:23 GMT",0.5994,0.9541

The Guardian,Celebrity Bear Hunt review – the most fun jungle reality show in decades,"Not since Ant and Dec’s early days in Australia has a TV competition been this enjoyable. The likes of Mel B, Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen and Boris Becker are excellent value – and hugely funnyBear Grylls. It’s Bear Grylls of course, not a real bear. I mention that upfront just in case, like me, your heart leapt in anticipation when the title Celebrity Bear Hunt flashed up on your screen. Exactly which minor celebs were envisioned screaming and flailing through undergrowth pursued by an ursine foe hungry for buffed, botoxed flesh will have been different for each of us – but what a vision indeed!No doubt the day will come, and sooner than we think, when such entertainment is a standard part of the TV schedules. Until then, I’ve got to tell you: this is a remarkably full-blooded substitute. Only two episodes were available for review but by the end of them we’ve had, under the broiling Costa Rican jungle sun, boats sinking in crocodile-filled waters, two captures in camouflage nets, ravine crossings, snakes, and earnest discussions about making sure to do your daily poo before the next challenge so you can bomb along with as little hindrance as possible. The 12 celebs are divided into teams and, as soon as one of them splits from their pack, Bear – yes! – leaps out of the undergrowth, rugby-tackles them to the ground, trusses them up and leaves them in the sun to die. No, all right, not the last bit – he goes and collects them later – but the rest is true and excellent. I haven’t had this much fun watching a reality TV competition since the earliest days of I’m a Celebrity … Get Me out of Here!. Continue reading...","Wed, 05 Feb 2025 05:00:29 GMT",0.5563,0.9726

The Guardian,The food filter: which supermarket has the best extra-virgin olive oil?,"From luxury Sicilian to budget buys, our Rome correspondent tests supermarket extra-virgin olive oils – and reveals how much you should spend • The best hot sauces, tasted and rated by Thomasina MiersYears ago, a good cook, who happened to be Greek, told me to think of olive oil not simply as liquid fat, but as an essential ingredient, as flavour and as a seasoning, with the ability to act like herbs and spices. He’s absolutely right and his excellent advice continues to motivate me when I’m choosing extra-virgin olive oil, which is the single most important ingredient I buy, and my biggest expense in the kitchen. While I do have the odd special bottle for drizzling, I am more interested in a good-tasting all-rounder that I can use for everything (my cooking is largely vegetable-, pasta-, pulse-, cheese- and egg-centric), including deep-frying (in a very small pan).Just to recap, olive oil is the liquid fat obtained by pressing olives, which are fruits. Once picked, they need to be processed as soon as possible – that is, crushed, then centrifugally spun to separate the pulp, water and oil, all in scrupulously clean machinery and at a steady temperature, which preserves the natural aromas of the olives. It takes about eight kilos of olives to make a litre of oil, which, to be considered extra-virgin olive oil, needs to have no defects and no more than 0.8% of free fatty acids. And that comes at a price: expect to pay between £14 and £18 a litre. Continue reading...","Sat, 01 Feb 2025 10:00:39 GMT",0.6369,0.9847

After experiencing displacement, my parents instilled in me the idea that trust had to be earned; they had seen the risks that come with being vulnerable in a new environment. Being wary of the unfamiliar was their way of ensuring we stayed safe in a world that wasn’t always welcoming.As I got older, their anxieties became my own.

The Guardian,Paprikash fish and leek and olive stew: Irina Georgescu’s recipes from the Danube,"Two traditional and homely dishes from RomaniaThe way we Romanians cook at home is more varied and regional than what you get in the country’s restaurants, which generally serve a pretty standard menu across the country. We have old traditions of preserving and of cooking with seasonal fruit and vegetables, influenced by observing 180 days of fasting annually (fortunately not all in a row). Even when we do cook with meat or fish, our dishes often feature spring onions, leeks, chard, spinach, courgettes, aubergines and tomatoes, and there are constant culinary nods to the Roman empire, too: leeks, so loved by the Romans, are the culinary symbol of Oltenia in the south of the country; we still bake ash bread under a dome-shaped earthenware lid called a testum, known locally as a țest, much as they did in Pompeii; we add vinegar, a Roman favourite, to our soups; and we use lots of lovage and parsley, which flavoured many ancient Roman dishes. But the similarities stop at garlic, which Romans hated, and which we love. Continue reading...","Wed, 05 Feb 2025 08:00:32 GMT",0.0,-0.6709

We weren’t in the Arctic on a cruise ship but steering a narrowboat in northern England, almost the farthest north you can reach on the inland waterways. There was snow on the hills. The Leeds &amp; Liverpool Canal, which climbs to 148 metres above sea level as it crosses the Pennines between the east and west coasts, had only recently thawed after a cold snap.A canal holiday is usually thought of as a summer pastime: standing at the tiller in T-shirt and shorts, followed by evenings in canalside beer gardens. But the canals are quieter in the off season (from October to May), and it is unlikely you will find queues at locks or water points. The sparsity of boat traffic is also easier on the nerves if you’re new to steering a 30-tonne steel battering ram round bends, through narrow bridges and beside expensive moored boats. For the first time ever, I would be at the tiller of a wide-beam (11ft 5in-wide) boat. Continue reading...","Wed, 05 Feb 2025 07:00:30 GMT",0.0,0.8462

Kennedy then referenced a “series of studies” showing that “to particular antigens, Blacks have a much stronger reaction”.The exchange is cause for alarm for many, as it signified how close a man who holds medically racist beliefs was to becoming the country’s leading health official. Dr Richard Kennedy – an author of the study referenced at the hearing, who is not related to Kennedy – told NPR that while it’s true the immune response to vaccination can vary by race, sex and “potentially dozens of other factors”, the data does not support a change in vaccine schedule based on race.

Roberto Eid Forest, the head of local police, said investigating officers were still in the process of identifying victims, but they believed the 'primary perpetrator', not previously known to police, was among the dead. He said authorities had had 'no prior warning signs' of the attack, which happened soon after 12.30pm at a campus housing an adult education centre and other learning facilities, and that it was believed the gunman acted alone.Sweden shooting: 10 people dead after attack at education centre in Örebro, say police – latest updatesSwedish police say about 10 people dead in Örebro campus attack Continue reading...","Tue, 04 Feb 2025 19:50:59 GMT",-0.8555,-0.9918
