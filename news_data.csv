I was about to spend the year as a Booker judge.All my life I have dreamed of having swathes of time filled with nothing but reading. Yet as I stared at that first tranche of books, my overriding feeling was apprehension. Awarding a prize with the power to transform literary history, as well as the winner’s career, isn’t a task to take lightly.

That is one of several leading questions posed by Hugh Grant’s professorial villain Mr Reed in the hit new film Heretic, which twists examinations of faith into viciously entertaining psychological horror.Mr Reed’s targets are, at least externally, representatives of religious certainty: two sister missionaries from the the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints who knock on his door with hopes to convert him. Sister Barnes (Yellowjackets’ Sophie Thatcher), a convert from Philadelphia, is quieter, more droll and naturally skeptical. Sister Paxton (Chloe East), raised Mormon in Utah, is more stereotypically chipper, polite and credulous. Both believe Mr Reed – at least enough to step inside and escape a downpour – when he says that his wife is baking pie in the other room and will join them shortly; sister missionaries are not allowed to be alone with a man unless another woman is present.

Every inch has been designed for efficiency, yet the first impression is one of warmth and comfort. The kitchen’s deep orange splashback and the dark green cabinets with red interiors are all bathed in natural light, with sweeping views of the city rooftops beyond.This is the work of Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky, the architect, activist and resistance fighter who in 1926 designed the Frankfurt Kitchen – the prototype for the modern fitted version now standard in the west. It introduced many features we now take for granted: continuous countertops, built-in cabinets and drawers optimised for storage, a tiled splashback – all designed as a complementary whole.

The Guardian,‘He painted with a fury for life’ – how Frank Auerbach put lust and sorrow into every brushstroke,"Saved from the Holocaust, this supremely modern painter captured the devastation of postwar Britain as if its wounds were his own – but he ultimately found salvation in painting• Frank Auerbach dies aged 93• I’ll die with a brush in my hand: Frank Auerbach – a life in picturesWhen I found out Frank Auerbach was dead I thought once more of the heartbreaking story of his parents Max Auerbach and Charlotte Nora Borchardt, who saved his life by putting their child on a train from Berlin to London in 1939. Auerbach told his friend William Feaver they packed things he would need in his future life, including linen for when he married. They knew they would never see him grow up, or be there for any of his future. They believed they would soon die. And they did, in the Holocaust of Europe’s Jews.What a future they missed. The son they saved became one of the greatest British artists of modern times who painted with a fury for life and a gravitas of grief, as if his lust and sorrow were fighting it out in each mighty brushstroke. Slashes of red or black streak across a pair of mid-period canvases, bringing savage bolts of lightning to a lime parkland or a grey heath in violent pastoral scenes that make a spring day seem like pure agony. And that’s in his mature art, when he was more reconciled to life and the healing act of painting itself. Continue reading...","Tue, 12 Nov 2024 17:51:57 GMT",-0.7964,-0.9702

Cheered on by Elon Musk, Trump is expected to gut public regulators – including the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which enforces unions’ right to organise in America’s workplaces. Musk, who rejects unions as creating “a lords-and-peasants sort of thing”, had already joined a legal claim, alongside Amazon founder and fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos, arguing the NLRB is “unconstitutional” and should be scrapped.It is against this bleak outlook for US labour activists that a new documentary, Union, opens in the UK this week. It follows the David and Goliath battle of a ragtag group of workers at Amazon’s huge JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, New York, to create a union from scratch, and force Bezos’s retailing giant to the negotiating table.

The Guardian,Israel’s true objective in northern Gaza? Removing Palestinians – and annexing the territory | Ben Reiff,"Settlers have been dreaming of a return to Gaza for nearly 20 years – and Trump’s presidency may only embolden themBen Reiff is a senior editor at +972 magazineLast week, Brig Gen Itzik Cohen, a senior IDF officer, quietly admitted what the international community has long been reluctant to acknowledge: that Israel is carrying out ethnic cleansing in northern Gaza, and deceiving the world about its true objectives in the besieged territory. He made the admission during a closed briefing to Israeli journalists last Tuesday regarding the army’s activities in the north of the strip. Israel’s forces, he boasted, were getting closer to the “complete evacuation” of Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya – Gaza’s three northernmost cities, which have been under intense Israeli bombardment since early October. “There is no intention of allowing the residents of the northern Gaza Strip to return to their homes,” Cohen continued, before adding that his “clear orders” were to “create a cleansed space”.The army hastened to distance itself from Cohen’s comments after they garnered the attention of the international media: what may have sounded like war crimes, a spokesperson clarified, was merely a remark taken out of context. Yet what we see playing out on the ground in northern Gaza is exactly as Cohen described it: tens of thousands of civilians forced out of homes, shelters and hospitals, day after day, by airstrikes, artillery fire, quadcopter drones or armed battalions arriving at their door – who make sure to demolish or burn whatever is left behind.Ben Reiff is a senior editor at +972 magazineDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Will the American project survive the anger of white men? | Carol Anderson,"At key moments throughout US history, white male anger has been privileged over national security, progress or basic welfareA friend recently asked: “Do you think the United States will survive the anger of white men?” As blunt as the question is, the core element is not so far-fetched. In fact, the majority of white men (and women) who voted in the presidential election in 2024 have rallied around a man who has called for the “termination of the constitution”, vowed to be a “dictator”, and threatened to deploy the US military against Americans. They support a man who is a convicted felon, an adjudicated rapist, a proven liar, who has been fined nearly half a billion dollars for fraud, who incited an insurrection that injured 140 police officers, and who mismanaged the Covid-19 pandemic causing hundreds of thousands to die needlessly.The fact that Donald Trump’s candidacy was even viable, given that horrific track record, was because of the support of white men. White men, whose anger was on full display at Madison Square Garden as they spewed racist, misogynistic venom. White men who attacked poll workers and also voters of Kamala Harris. White men who chafed at the thought that their wives and girlfriends would not vote for the man who thought it was “a beautiful thing” that reproductive rights had been destroyed. And, as the New York Times reported, the downwardly mobile, frustrated “white men without a degree, [who] have been surpassed in income by college-educated women”.Carol Anderson is the Robert W Woodruff Professor of African American Studies at Emory University and the author of White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide Continue reading...","Tue, 12 Nov 2024 11:00:56 GMT",-0.5719,-0.9587

The Guardian,"The great danger is that this time, Trumpism starts making sense | Randeep Ramesh","So far, the president-elect’s rhetoric has been at odds with reality. If that changes, it would redraw the US electoral mapDonald Trump’s unpredictable style and electoral success reflect a turbulent era when neither progressives nor authoritarians have secured control. Far from signalling an autocratic takeover, his rise shows a political landscape in flux. The 2008 crash and its uneven recovery marked the decline of the old economic order. But in 2016, the rise of Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders on the left highlighted a real shift, as neoliberalism’s grip loosened, making space for once marginalised ideas.Since then, two US presidencies have acknowledged the need to rebuild an economy that supports blue-collar workers affected by free trade, immigration and globalisation. While neither administration succeeded – and paid for it at the ballot box – the result has been a growing constituency on both sides of the American political divide that takes seriously, albeit often rhetorically, economic injustice. But for any political movement to become dominant, it has to shape the core ideas that matter to everyone, not just its diehard supporters.

The Guardian,British farming is in a grim state and Labour’s new measures will only make it worse | Tom Fairfax,"Brexit, the cost of living and the climate crisis are all making farmers’ lives much more difficult. Taxing us is not the answerTom Fairfax farms Mindrum Farm in NorthumberlandLast year, Keir Starmer looked farmers in the eye at the annual National Farmers’ Union (NFU) conference and said he knew what it meant to lose a farm. It is “not like losing any other business”, he said. “It can’t come back.” Since then, Labour has announced a number of new measures aimed at farmers, including dropping the inheritance tax exemption that many have enjoyed. This is a drastic shift for an already strained sector and has sparked heated debate among farmers I know. But one thing has been missing: an understanding of farming and the pressures it faces.The modern UK farming industry has been shaped by decades of government policy aimed at ensuring we have enough food to survive. While agriculture isn’t directly state controlled, the government’s influence is felt through regulation and incentives. If you are old enough, you may remember rationing, which marked an era when governments prioritised access to cheap calories, driving the shift toward intensive farming. This focus, backed by successive governments, led to farmers ramping up production by using new technology and infrastructure, and chemicals such as DDT and glyphosate. But cheap food had vast environmental and social costs, posing a drastic threat to the sector’s sustainability and resilience in the long term, as soils were depleted and biodiverse habitats gave way to monocultures.Tom Fairfax farms Mindrum Farm, a regenerative mixed farm in the Cheviot foothills in Northumberland Continue reading...","Tue, 12 Nov 2024 10:00:52 GMT",-0.7783,-0.7812

OK, it looked more like a thousand catherine wheels, then 15 minutes straight of sky-filling light cascades, like beautiful waterfalls, that have technical firework names such as Whistling Palms, but that couldn’t be right: how much would that cost? Even if everyone on the block chipped in, they couldn’t have had a bigger budget than the London mayor Sadiq Khan.In 2021, civic life had almost returned to normal, firework-wise, and amateur-hour across the road still looked pretty professional. That year, I ran over the road to say thanks. And the year after, feeling like a freeloader, I gave them £20. Both times they looked puzzled, like, “What’s the big deal? We are merely lighting up our neighbourhood like the Commonwealth, which is what any normal person would do.” Continue reading...","Tue, 12 Nov 2024 11:00:53 GMT",0.0,0.9643
The Guardian,The Guardian view on Cop29: 1.5C has been passed – so speed up the green transition | Editorial,"Sir Keir Starmer’s pledge on emissions is an encouraging step at a frightening momentPredictions that this will be the first calendar year in which the 1.5C warming limit enshrined in the Paris agreement is surpassed provide a stark backdrop to the UN’s 29th climate conference. This year – 2024 – has already seen the hottest-ever day and month, and is expected by experts to be the hottest year too. Addressing delegates on Tuesday, the UN chief, António Guterres, referred to a “masterclass in climate&nbsp;destruction”. The escalating pattern of destructive weather events, most recently in Valencia,&nbsp;is a warning of what lies ahead.When the 1.5C figure was included in the 2015 deal, it was known to be a stretch. The treaty says countries must hold the average temperature “well below 2C above pre-industrial levels” and aim for 1.5C. Busting this target in 2024 will not mean it has been definitively&nbsp;missed; the measurement of global temperatures relies on averages recorded over 20 or more years. But the crossing of this threshold is a menacing moment. Around the world, people as well as governments and climate specialists should take notice – and act.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on China’s growth limits: shifting to a post-industrial economy is tough | Editorial,"Beijing’s model is hitting roadblocks. It needs to move toward more home-grown spending – even if one-party politics makes that hardChina faces what the economist Albert Hirschman noted decades ago: explosive growth is unbalanced, and success embeds that unevenness into political, business and cultural institutions, making change tough. China now stands at this crossroads.The Asian giant’s economic growth, which previously relied on exports and a debt-driven construction boom, is facing headwinds: the disastrous crash from a real estate investment spree, big losses hitting the banks, and local governments facing a crippling debt crisis. With households highly indebted, China cannot just build more apartments to sell. Sustaining an export-led boom will become harder as anti-dumping measures and Donald Trump’s tariffs hit. All this when Chinese firms report plunging profits. Continue reading...","Tue, 12 Nov 2024 18:26:41 GMT",0.2732,-0.8176
The Guardian,A shift in focus from exams to wellbeing is welcome. Now we need the details | Letters,"Bridget Phillipson’s call for a culture change in schools is long overdue, say readersI am delighted to hear Bridget Phillipson speak of the need for a culture change in schools (Phillipson to ask schools to end exam ‘tunnel vision’ and look to wellbeing, 6 November). As a grandparent, I have been appalled by the anecdotes I’ve been hearing about academy schools. It is clear to me that schools have lost any focus on their pupils’ wellbeing. It appears that they are treating children as numbers to be processed rather than as individuals with personal needs and characters. In large part this may be down to resource shortages, preventing teachers from doing what they should do.However, there seems also to have been a drive among senior school leaders to adopt fashionable policies such as “zero-tolerance” attitudes to misdeeds and the insistence that every pupil must carry a report card at all times. These cards are marked every time the child is considered to have offended, and if certain points thresholds are exceeded, detention, isolation or other punishment&nbsp;follows.

Its new American owners would be wise to ignore industry gloom and invest in discerning movie audiencesWho wants to buy an arthouse cinema chain? That question may seem unexpected now that being depressed about post-pandemic filmgoing appears to be the industry’s default position. But the sale of the Curzon cinema group to New York investment company Fortress – part of a foreclosure auction of assets belonging to current American owner Cohen Realty Enterprises – has been met with a lack of surprise, still less alarm, in the industry and within the Curzon group itself, who reportedly regard the new owner as more likely to invest and to nurture long-term growth than the current proprietor. Fortress bid $5m [£3.9m] for Curzon, and insiders are calling it a “bargain”.This is one of the UK’s prestige cinema companies with a history going back to 1934, now with 350 employees, 16 venues and 58 screens. It consolidated its position in the arthouse marketplace with its acquisition of Artificial Eye in 2006 and the launching of a streaming service in 2010 and this integration was boldly masterminded by its outgoing CEO Philip Knatchbull, the dapper, urbane leader with a movie-aristocrat and actual-aristocrat background – he is the son of producer John Brabourne and grandson of Lord Mountbatten – who left last year.

The Guardian,‘No Americans putting on bad Belfast accents!’ How Disney drama Say Nothing brings the Troubles to life,"A new series is stepping into the fraught territory of Northern Ireland in the 70s by telling the real-life story of a woman abducted by the IRA. Its creators talk about truth, reconciliation and trying to depict both sides of the conflict“To be honest, I’d always thought of the Troubles as a male story,” says the US author and journalist Patrick Radden Keefe, when asked what first attracted him to the events covered in his 2018 bestselling nonfiction book Say Nothing. “So, part of it for me was the novelty of the idea that there was this woman in the IRA and she had gone on hunger strike with her sister in 1973.”Now an executive producer on the TV adaptation of his book, Keefe first heard about its subjects in 2013, when he read a New York Times obituary of the IRA volunteer Dolours Price, which mentioned the abduction and disappearance of widowed mother of 10 Jean McConville. “Right there, in this little article, were the seeds for the whole thing: the idea that there were these two very different women, and how they were connected by these acts of violence.” Continue reading...","Tue, 12 Nov 2024 11:00:55 GMT",-0.3208,-0.8074
The Guardian,‘I’ll be bonking into my 80s’: how I saw off the symptoms of menopause,"When hormones played havoc with Stacey Duguid’s libido, she was determined not to be stereotyped. Here she describes her fight back
It’s amazing how three little letters can encompass something so big. From sexual identity to sexual pleasure, sex can mean so many things. But what about sexual wellness? And what does sexual wellness, in the context of menopause, even mean?Wildly open to interpretation, I’d say my sexual wellness anchors around three things: the mind (as in desire or lack of), the body (relating to both comfort and discomfort), and the soul (should I really be enjoying/pursuing sex given the broader stereotypical view when it comes to older women and sex?).

The Guardian,Our flat’s rising ground rent is going to ruin our move,"Our buyer’s lender has pulled out because the charge rises with the property’s rising value. Now the delay risks collapsing the whole chainWe found a buyer for our leasehold flat, but on the day of exchange their lender declined to offer a mortgage, despite having previously agreed in principle. The reason was a provision in the lease for the ground rent, currently £200 per annum, to be amended every 25 years according to the market value of the property. We had no trouble securing a mortgage when we purchased the property, and it has not prevented sales of other flats in the building. We have subsequently spent thousands in legal fees trying to secure a deed of variation on the leasehold agreement to amend the ground rent clause but this has been endlessly held up by the freeholder.

The Guardian,Are there any alternatives to fresh coriander? I hate the stuff | Kitchen aide,"Depending on how you use it, there are plenty of substitutes for coriander’s bright flavourEveryone knows a coriander hater who won’t go near the stuff and describes its taste as “soapy” (some studies suggest there may be a gene that causes this). Itamar Srulovich, however, is not one of them: “I adore fresh coriander, and always have,” says the chef/co-owner of the Honey &amp; Co group of restaurants, cafes and delis in London. “In Israel, and indeed in any of the coriander countries, if you go into someone’s house and there’s a bunch of coriander in the kitchen, you really know about it – it’s so potent. What we get in the UK is so tame by comparison, so when people say they can’t stand its strong smell and taste, I often think: what are you even talking about?”Tame or not, when it comes to coriander substitutions, it all depends on what you’re making. If you’re using the fresh herb as a garnish, say, you could obviously just ditch it and call it a day, although, granted, you’d then miss that hit of freshness. Srulovich suggests looking at other soft herbs: “They’re often quite interchangeable, so if you’re told to finish something with chopped coriander, parsley will do pretty much the same job and bring that essential brightness.” If, however, you’re making something that’s highly spiced or seasoned, or that features lots of garlic, you might find parsley “a bit too polite”, in which case Thai basil, chervil or a mix of the two might make a good replacement: “You want something with a bit of funk.”Got a culinary dilemma?

The Guardian,Is the party over for Belgrade’s club scene on the Danube?,"Raft houses, known as ‘splavs’, became synonymous with the hedonistic nightclub scene in Serbia’s capital. Now they are being cleared from the river to make way for luxury flats, bars and shopsFor 20 years, the raft bar Zappa Barka sat on a bend of the River Danube in central Belgrade. Revellers walked a gangplank to board the boat, then danced to live music and DJs on wooden floors, or stayed on deck all night to see the sun rise over the water. But in June 2024 the raft’s electricity supply was suddenly cut, and the barge was towed to a new destination far from the city centre.Zappa’s existence was always unstable, but there was a sense of exception in Belgrade. That’s because this boat bar was one of Belgrade’s “splavs”, raft houses that have been built on Belgrade’s two rivers, the Danube and the Sava, since the 1960s. Locals use them in summer as waterside retreats, gathering with friends for barbecues when temperatures can hit 38C. Families buy their moorings for 99 years and can renovate their raft house within certain parameters. Continue reading...","Tue, 12 Nov 2024 07:00:49 GMT",0.4019,0.2732

He had already made the difficult decision to tell his parents that he and his wife, Maram, were leaving Gaza with their three young children; the checkpoint was on the road to the Rafah crossing into Egypt. He greeted people he recognised, tried to reassure his children. And then he was called out of the queue. “The young man with the black backpack who is carrying a red-haired boy. Put the boy down and come my way.”Abu Toha was born in Gaza and had lived there for most of his 31 years, frequently under Israeli bombardment, but this was the first time he had encountered Israeli soldiers in person. He was ordered, by megaphone, to strip naked. When dressed again he was blindfolded, and a numbered bracelet attached to his wrist. He was sworn at, punched and kicked, including in the face, and forced into a truck; when the blindfold was pulled off, “a soldier is aiming an M16 at my head,” he wrote, a month later, in the New Yorker. “Another soldier, behind a computer, asks questions and takes a photo of me.

Since Abram Kameraz had begun to commute by train from Leningrad (now St Petersburg) to the suburban town of Pavlovsk earlier in the summer of 1941, attacks by enemy planes had become a frequent cause of delay. Through the carriage window, Kameraz saw the road was littered with bodies. These men, women and children had been killed by German planes which had strafed and bombed the crowds of refugees as they fled towards the city. As Kameraz caught the silhouette of a German Stuka cresting the horizon, the driver stopped the train and ordered the passengers to run to a nearby ditch for cover.Kameraz, 36, was a potato specialist, one of about 50 botanists who worked at the Plant Institute, the world’s first seed bank, situated off St Isaac’s Square in the centre of Leningrad. The institute’s potato collection contained 6,000 varieties, including many rare cultivars – the largest, most diverse potato collection yet gathered in history, a crop of inestimable scientific importance. And right now, hundreds of delicate South American specimens were planted in sheds in the fields on the outskirts of the city, in the path of the advancing German army.

By the time she had finished with this unlikely hero – “a modern, rational, state-planning bureaucrat in the midst of all these over-ambitious nobles” is how the Oxford history professor Steven Gunn puts it, which is cool, but hardly Indiana Jones – Mantel had brought Cromwell so vividly to life that it made sense that she couldn’t bear to kill him.
