The Guardian,"Ukraine war briefing: Strengthen Kyiv’s hand before peace talks, says Nato chief","Mark Rutte says Ukraine not yet in the ‘position of strength’ it needs for talks with Russia; Biden says US and allies ‘can’t walk away’. What we know on day 1,056Ukraine is not in a strong enough position for peace talks with Russia, Nato chief, Mark Rutte, said on Monday. “At this moment, clearly Ukraine is not there, because they cannot at this moment negotiate from a position of strength,” Rutte told EU lawmakers. “We have to do more to make sure by changing the trajectory of the conflict that they can get to that position of strength.”Donald Trump will be sworn into office as US president next Monday after vowing on the campaign trail to bring a swift end to Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. Rutte said: “We all want this war to end, but above all, we want peace to last. Peace will not last if Putin gets his way in Ukraine, because then he will press ahead … I am convinced that peace can only last if Ukraine comes to the table from a position of strength.”The United States and its allies “can’t walk away” from Ukraine, the outgoing US president, Joe Biden, said on Monday as he prepares to step down next week and hand power to Donald Trump. Biden on Monday marvelled that at the start of the war Putin thought Russian forces would easily defeat Ukraine in a matter of days. It was an assessment US and European intelligence officials shared. 
 Instead, Biden said, his administration and its allies have “laid the foundation” for the Trump administration to help Ukraine eventually arrive at a moment where it can negotiate a just end to the nearly three year old conflict.“Today, Ukraine is still a free and independent country with the potential for a bright future,” Biden said. Hailing US and international support for Kyiv since Moscow’s 2022 invasion, Biden said that the Russian ruler, Vladimir Putin, has “failed to achieve any of his strategic objectives” but that “there is more to do, we can’t walk away”.Volodymyr Zelenskyy countered that the Slovak prime minister, Robert Fico, can “come to Kyiv on Friday” after the latter on Monday invited Ukraine’s president to Slovakia. Fico was calling for negotiations “as soon as possible” after Ukraine decided to cut off cheap Russian gas that flows through both their countries to western Europe. It comes after Fico’s trip to Moscow before Christmas to meet Vladimir Putin angered EU countries and protests at home against Fico’s government. Thousands of Slovaks took to the streets on Friday to protest against Fico’s journey and his friendly ties with the Kremlin at a rally called “Slovakia is Europe”.The Kremlin accused Kyiv of “energy terrorism” over what Moscow claimed was an attempted attack on infrastructure for the TurkStream gas pipeline that carries Russian gas to Europe via Turkey, Russian news agencies reported. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the drone strike was a “continuation of the line of energy terrorism that Kyiv has been pursuing, under the curation of its overseas friends, for a long time”, state news agencies reported.A Ukrainian official said Russian forces were bypassing the logistics hub of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine that they have fought for months to capture and focusing instead on cutting supply lines to it. Maj Viktor Trehubov, a Ukrainian army spokesperson, told the Associated Press on Monday that Russian troops were going around Pokrovsk where Ukrainian defence has kept them at bay. He said the Russians were taking aim at a highway that leads from there to the central Ukraine city of Dnipro. That route is crucial for supplies feeding Ukrainian forces in the entire region. Cutting the highway traffic would also severely weaken Pokrovsk.Italy will sign an agreement with Ukraine and Unesco to rebuild the city of Odesa and its cathedral which was badly damaged by a Russian attack, said Antonio Tajani, the Italian foreign minister. Ukraine said the Orthodox cathedral was damaged when it was hit during a Russian missile attack on the country’s southern port city in July last year. Russia denied responsibility. “As the G7 presidency, we continue to work for a just peace,” Tajani told lawmakers, adding that supporting Ukraine’s energy system was also a priority for Italy, which holds the rotating presidency of the Group of Seven (G7) wealthy nations until the end of this year.

The Guardian,"Bump review – one of the warmest, fuzziest comedies on TV","The hit Aussie comedy about teenage parents has matured into something relatable, genuinely funny and frequently devastating. It will be missedThe first series of Australian comedy Bump was an indubitably high-concept affair. Mere minutes after we were introduced to uptight, intellectually ferocious, all-round-type-A schoolgirl Oly, her life had been turned upside down. A sudden stomachache in the playground quickly progressed into vomiting in the school toilets then full-blown labour in the back of an ambulance – but know-it-all Oly (Nathalie Morris) had no inkling she was even pregnant. That the father was not her similarly nerdy boyfriend Lachie but a mildly delinquent classmate called Santiago (“Santi”) added even more world-shattering horror into the mix.Birth did not magically bestow Oly with motherly instincts. “Get that thing away from me,” she snarled when introduced to her newborn daughter. But once the shellshock and fury had dissipated, she did manage to adjust, and Bump grew into a much calmer show about the maternal juggle. Granted, this balancing act involved lessons being interrupted by a wailing baby, but it still felt oddly relatable. In fact, by hurling such freedom-eviscerating responsibility into the lap of a teenage girl who had been led to believe the world was her oyster, Bump was able to highlight the universal unfairness of new motherhood: the sleep deprivation, the mastitis, the bleeding, the simmering jealousy towards the relatively unfettered father – these things happen whether you are 17 or 47 (although having your peers snigger over a gif of your face superimposed on the head of a calving deer is something most of us are spared).

The Guardian,Hope by Pope Francis review – the first memoir by a living pontiff,"A historic papal autobiography offers unique insights into the challenges faced by the leader of the Catholic church, but skates over scandalsAt 88 years of age, Pope Francis is the oldest pontiff for more than a century. Yet, after major surgery in 2023, and persistent knee problems that require the use of a wheelchair, he shows no sign of calling it a day. Now, he has decided that an autobiography, originally planned to be published after his death, should come out to coincide with the Jubilee year he has called for the Roman Catholic church in 2025.As the first ever memoir by a pope, Hope is a publisher’s dream, with a rich backstory culminating in Francis’s election in 2013. It recounts how, as Jorge Bergoglio, grandchild of Italian immigrants to Argentina, he grew up in a sprawling family, loved football and the tango (which he calls “an emotional, visceral dialogue that comes from afar, from ancient roots”), studied chemistry, then joined the Jesuit order and became a priest. After dallying with Peronism and enduring the Argentinian junta, he became the cardinal archbishop of Buenos Aires. Then, just as he was planning his retirement, Benedict XVI resigned and he was chosen as his successor. Continue reading...","Tue, 14 Jan 2025 00:01:42 GMT",0.4404,0.6652

The Guardian,"Zuckerberg, Musk, answer me this: what about the child abuse scandal playing out online? | Susanna Rustin","Victims of ‘grooming gangs’ have been badly let down, but children must be protected on social media as well as in the real worldTwo seemingly contradictory things are true. It was appalling for the UK’s domestic policy agenda to be hijacked last week by Elon Musk’s blaze of interest in child sexual exploitation gangs. And government action in response to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse was long overdue. As ministers look in more detail at plans announced in a panic, it is essential that the many anxieties surrounding group-based child sexual exploitation – euphemistically known as “grooming gangs” because of the techniques used to ensnare vulnerable girls – do not distract from the seriousness of the issue.On Friday, Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, added his voice to those calling for a new inquiry into child sexual exploitation – a specific form of abuse carried out in exchange for money or other things that victims want or need; and often involving financial advantage for perpetrators, who traffic children under their control. A large majority of group-based child sex offences (83% in 2023) are committed by white men, although some areas have a problem with gangs of mainly Pakistani-heritage abusers. It is true that the inquiry’s broad remit did not include a thorough investigation of child sexual exploitation specifically. There are many gaps in the data, as multiple reviews have noted.Susanna Rustin is a Guardian social affairs journalist Continue reading...","Mon, 13 Jan 2025 16:56:06 GMT",-0.743,-0.9569
The Guardian,DIY rape kits at universities are a welcome sea change – but they can only offer a hologram of justice | Zoe Williams,"As the police continue to fail rape victims, it’s no wonder students are looking elsewhere to report what has happened to them. These initiatives won’t change our broken legal system thoughEighty-three per cent of women who are raped in England and Wales do not report it to the police, which is partly why universities have a student resolution procedure – so that students who don’t want to press charges can still have redress. But at the University of Bristol, says Katie White, co-founder of Enough, the campaign to stop violence against women: “Fewer than five people report to the university each year.” She continues: “There are estimates that 8% of female students are raped while they are at university, so just calculating the student body at Bristol, that’s 500 students a year. It’s staggering. That’s about 99% of students not reporting officially.”That’s the background to Enough, a not-for-profit that has handed out 4,500 self-swab “rape kits” in Bristol. You send them to a lab, and they will pass the results on to the police if that’s what you decide you want. You can also write a time-stamped testimony of what happened, on its website. Rather than a searchable database, this is a locked portal that only the victim can access. The point is twofold: it can be referenced for future criminal proceedings if there are any, and it is an accepted waypoint in trauma recovery, to record rather than try to forget what happened. It is estimated that 94% of rape survivors experience post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in the first two weeks following an attack. Enough says it has received 100 reports to the portal in its first six weeks alone. Continue reading...","Mon, 13 Jan 2025 18:33:48 GMT",0.5789,-0.9948

The Guardian,Saba is not a saviour of UK investment trusts. Look at its own miserable record | Nils Pratley,"To date, US hedge fund has been able to lob insults at targets while escaping detailed scrutinyThe great advantage of hostile takeover battles for public companies is that you get a clean punch-up. The records of both parties – bidder and target – are put in the spotlight. Every claim is tested in open argument over many weeks. At the end of the process, shareholders make an informed choice. Voting turnout is usually high because only the most dozy investors fail to notice what’s at stake.Unfortunately, the current scrap for control of seven UK investment trusts is not like that. That is most obviously the case because Saba, the US hedge fund led by Boaz Weinstein, is not making a takeover bid. Its proposal instead is to sack the boards of all seven trusts, install its own people, and, possibly, appoint itself as fund manager. So not a takeover – but very definitely an attempt by a minority shareholder (Saba has stakes in the seven trusts of between 19% and 29%) to seize control.

Despite not yet holding office for a minute, Trump has made it plain that in his second term the U.S. will be an unreliable partner swayed by his personal whim, that he has no respect for historic alliances and that he has contempt for the rule-based international order that the U.S. has led since the end of World War II to prevent the reemergence of catastrophic great power collisions.Beginning with his “Merry Christmas to all” tweet that he wanted to seize the Panama Canal, Canada and Greenland, Trump has not relented in his absurd claims, extended to renaming the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. His disdain for the sovereignty of independent nations—two of them NATO allies and Panama a fellow member of the Organization of American States—has undermined the credibility of opposition to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s ambition to grab Taiwan. The soft power of the U.S., ultimately based on its democratic example and respect for international order, has been tossed away by Trump’s fantasy Manifest Destiny that is simply the latest wrinkle in his isolationism. Hardly the Rough Rider, if Trump were acting as Putin’s or Xi’s agent he could not have kowtowed more for their benefit.Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln: A Self-Made Man, Wrestling With His Angel and All the Powers of Earth Continue reading...","Mon, 13 Jan 2025 09:03:05 GMT",0.0258,-0.8629
The Guardian,"The risks of ‘space junk’ are clear: what goes up, might well come back down on top of you | Patrick Schröder","As commercial space activity ramps up, detritus from launches poses a risk to active satellites and those of us down on EarthLast month, people in a small village in Kenya looked to the sky and saw a red glowing ring slowly descending. The half-tonne piece of metal crashed into a nearby thicket with a loud bang, leaving them shaken and perplexed. What was the mysterious object? Was it an alien spacecraft? Sadly, the truth of the matter was much more prosaic: it was a piece of space junk.The Kenya Space Agency identified the object as a separation ring from a launch rocket. Such objects are usually designed to burn up as they re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere or to fall over unpopulated areas, leading the agency to declare this as “an isolated case”.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on AI and public services: computers can’t cure all of Britain’s problems | Editorial,"Public investment in technology is the right move. But ministers must not become boosters for an industry that causes harm as well as goodDigital technology companies have reshaped our world and will continue doing so. Sir Keir Starmer knows his government must seek a role in shaping this new order – and avoid ceding all control to the US and China. According to official estimates, the UK is the third-largest AI market. Its universities are important incubators of talent. Google DeepMind, two of whose scientists won a Nobel chemistry prize last year, was a British company until Google bought it in 2014. But the world’s two largest economies, and particularly the US corporations that dominate our online lives, are a long way ahead. The danger for the rest of the world is being swept along in an AI wave over which it has little control.Expanding Britain’s publicly owned computing resource – a national asset known as sovereign compute capacity – is a necessary step toward securing technological independence. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, is right to warn of a coming battle to ensure democratic control of computing. Countering private-sector dominance with new public investment is part of that. Plans to boost the AI industry, beginning with a new growth zone in Oxfordshire, make sense as part of a 21st-century industrial strategy.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on globalisation and its discontents: how the left was left behind | Editorial,"As national populist parties gain ground in the west, progressives must put social and climate priorities ahead of market interestsDifferent year, same direction of travel. The likely formation of the first far-right-led government in Austria’s postwar history, after the breakdown this month of coalition talks between mainstream parties, is the latest confirmation of the illiberal drift in western democracies. Only a few years ago, Viktor Orbán’s Hungary remained a troublesome outlier in the European Union. These days, variations on Mr Orbán’s ethno-nationalist approach to 21st-century politics are flourishing across the continent. And in a week’s time, Donald Trump will be back in the White House.In an era of stagnating living standards and rising inequality, the growing appeal of national populism should not come as a surprise. The targeting of immigration, “liberal elites” and globalisation has channelled resentments felt in deindustrialised regions, where good jobs and a sense of identity were lost as capital and investment moved elsewhere. The migration of the less well-off towards parties of the far right is a symptom of times in which trust in mainstream politics has collapsed.

But with illegal ketamine use reaching record levels, the Home Office announced last week that it was considering reclassifying it as a class A drug in response to a dramatic increase in use among young people.An estimated 299,000 people aged 16 to 59 reported ketamine use in the year ending March 2023 in England and Wales, the largest number on record, according to Home Office data. Behind the headline figures, there is also evidence of a troubling culture shift, with an increasing number of people taking the drug, which has dissociative, anaesthetic and psychedelic effects, at home rather than in an occasional party setting.

The Guardian,The food filter: who makes the best crunchy peanut butter?,"From Whole Earth and Meridian to supermarket staples, which is the best crunchy peanut butter, and how much do you really need to spend on it?The best tinned tomatoesI came late to the peanut butter party, and my mum remains convinced that it’s extremely unhealthy stuff, which, to be fair to her, is probably true of the sugary versions of my childhood. In the past few years, however, peanut butter has gone back to its health-food roots. It is now championed for its protein and monounsaturated fat content, as brands stripped of their sweeteners and emulsifiers have occupied the premium end of the market. Given that these new-wave natural peanut butters tend to contain nothing but peanuts – give or take the odd pinch of salt – the difference between supermarket own-label and luxury jars tends to be slight. The biggest variations are largely in the sourcing and quality of the peanuts themselves.This means that peanut butter is a handy thing to have in the cupboard at all times. Personally, I prefer a loose, crunchy consistency; for all the claims about sustainable palm oil, there’s simply no need for it in peanut butter, which, like tahini, separates naturally over time and is just as easily stirred back together. To slow the separation, simply beat the oil back in, then store the jar upside down in the fridge – assuming it lasts that long. Continue reading...","Sat, 11 Jan 2025 10:00:10 GMT",0.6369,0.7966

The Guardian,‘I was waking up five times a night’: how film-maker Mikhail Krichman escaped from Russia,"The revered cinematographer was making an apocalyptic musical with Tilda Swinton deep in a salt mine when he realised he had to flee. Can he now save his son?It was March 2022 and Joshua Oppenheimer was waiting at Copenhagen airport for the young man who would be staying with him for a few weeks. Oppenheimer, who directed two devastating Oscar-nominated documentaries about the 1965 Indonesian genocide, The Act of Killing and The Look of Silence, had been working closely with Russian cinematographer Mikhail Krichman. He was now preparing to make The End, an audacious musical about the last family on earth hiding in their bunker following a climate-related apocalypse in which they were complicit. And Mikhail’s 22-year-old son, Vlad, was travelling to Copenhagen to participate in a workshop addressing the challenges implicit in The End, which was to be shot partly in German and Italian salt mines.Oppenheimer had never met Vlad before, though he knew of his joie de vivre and infectious good humour. But the young man who emerged at arrivals that day, having stepped off a flight from Moscow, cut a very different figure. “He looked terrible,” the director recalls. “He was pale. He was stuttering. He was traumatised. It was frankly heartbreaking. I asked him, ‘What’s the matter?’ He said, ‘I can’t go back.’” Continue reading...","Mon, 13 Jan 2025 16:58:55 GMT",0.0,-0.9282
The Guardian,Marvel is ready to recast Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa in Black Panther. Should they?,"The multiverse has has made room for a lot of unlikely reinventions, but murmurs that the late actor’s iconic character may be reworked with a new star could prove controversialMarvel’s multiverse has become a narrative Swiss army knife capable of slicing through the thorniest of creative dilemmas and papering over the widest of cracks. That said, few dilemmas are as sensitive as how to move forward with a superhero as iconic as Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman’s portrayal of T’Challa wasn’t just a performance – it was a cultural touchstone, woven so tightly into the fabric of modern blockbuster cinema that imagining anyone else in the role feels like attempting to rewrite history. Four years after Boseman’s untimely death from colon cancer, Marvel faces the delicate task of continuing a legacy that seems impossible to replicate.
 If rumblings out of Hollywood this week have foundation, however, the studio is beginning to countenance just that, a new T’Challa from an alternate reality who presumably finds his way into the mainstream Marvel universe via one of the umpteen ways we’ve seen superheroes such as Doctor Strange, various Spider-Men and Scarlet Witch crossing the boundaries between one reality and another. Jeff Sneider of the InSneider newsletter reports that the studio is finally “firmly open” to bringing back the king of Wakanda, despite previous attempts to recast the role having getting rebuffed by actors who didn’t want to jeopardise their careers by “stepping into Boseman’s gigantic shoes”.This might come as something of a surprise to Letitia Wright (T’Challa’s sister Shuri), who took up the mantle of the royal Avenger in the reasonably well-received 2022 sequel Black Panther: Wakanda Forever – though of course, she was not playing T’Challa himself. Wright has previously hinted a third film is in the works, though Marvel has not yet announced it is entering production. “We need a little bit of a break, we need to regroup and [director] Ryan [Coogler] needs to get back into the lab,” she told Variety in January 2023. “So it’s going to take a little while, but we’re really excited for you guys to see that.” Continue reading...","Mon, 13 Jan 2025 13:31:11 GMT",0.6486,0.9442

Go on any social media platform, though, and you will find self-appointed health influencers blaming them for everything from inflammation to the obesity epidemic.

The Guardian,The big picture: Henry Roy’s sleeping girl in Congo-Brazzaville,"The Franco-Haitian artist’s 2002 portrait exemplifies his gift for taking photographs that transcend time and placeHenry Roy’s book, Impossible Island, a survey of 40 years of his photography, is threaded with images of sleepers and dreamers in different corners of the world – Thailand, Tunisia, his adoptive France, his native Haiti. Roy took this picture of a girl making an impromptu cradle of a wheelbarrow in Congo-Brazzaville in 2002. Like all of his most evocative photographs, it asks several questions of the viewer – but the overriding one seems to be: how sleepy do you have to be to take a nap here?Roy’s photos often work this way: they create little mythologies that seem to take their subjects outside their particular time and place. As he noted of his practice in his 2017 book Superstition, what he is always restless for are images that “murmur the secret language of a world free from what contaminates us”. Here, the vibrant Sunday-best floral prints of the girl, the precision of her hair, seem to elevate her above the clay and dust of her surroundings. It comes as no surprise, looking at Roy’s pictures, that they have been cited as primary inspirations by cinematographers and film-makers, notably Oscar-winning director Barry Jenkins, who has suggested that he was inspired to create some of the visual sensuality of Moonlight by looking at Roy’s work.Impossible Island is published by Loose Joints Continue reading...","Sun, 12 Jan 2025 07:00:26 GMT",0.0,0.9719
