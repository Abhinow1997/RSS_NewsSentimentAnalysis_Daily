But few tipped it for the best picture award. The Brutalist seemed to have too much chewy critical adoration; A Complete Unknown is well-loved, especially amongst the boomer demographic which still makes up a considerable portion of the Bafta votership; Anora (see below) was the dark horse emerging into the limelight.

Mikey Madison broke ahead of a densely packed crowd of best-actress contenders (in which only the hapless Karla Sofía Gascón was really lagging behind) to win the Bafta for her wonderfully smart, funny, charismatic and vulnerable performance in Sean Baker’s Anora, playing a New York table dancer who gets a Vegas wedding to a Russian oligarch’s son. Her final closeup scene in that film is a thrilling masterclass in complexity. I admit that I myself had been rooting for Marianne Jean-Baptiste for her performance in Mike Leigh’s Hard Truths, but who could possibly begrudge Madison her night of triumph?Otherwise, the night’s big winner was Edward Berger’s superbly classy and sleek Vatican conspiracy drama Conclave, based on the Robert Harris bestseller; it was level pegging in terms of numbers with The Brutalist, but carried off the evening’s top prize. Conclave is the movie whose blue-chip excellence all round made it a firm favourite with Bafta voters, who were thrilled by Ralph Fiennes’s lead performance as the troubled cardinal; they were diverted by its visual flourishes, amused by its intelligent but approachable dialogue on religious issues and vastly entertained by its twist ending. Strict anti-spoiler rules dictate that we can’t fully discuss how this film in fact is part of a contemporary debate exhaustively analysed elsewhere.

The Guardian,Escaping Utopia review – there’s so much terrible detail about this cult it barely fits into the show,"Escapers from the Gloriavale sect open up about living in constant fear of damnation, its abuse of women – and a landmark court case brought by ex-female membersHello and welcome to another entrant in the popular television genre Do Try to Be Born a White Christian Man If You Can. This one is entitled Escaping Utopia, a three-part documentary series on Gloriavale, a secretive sect founded in 1969 by preacher Neville Cooper, after he was vouchsafed at the age of 22 a vision of heaven on Earth by God. This vision involved establishing an isolated community in a remote part of New Zealand that would be run along wholly egalitarian lines, and men would live in absolute parity to women to secure their place in feminist heaven.I jest, of course. Gloriavale ran – and, in reduced form, still runs – on the principles of women’s absolute subservience to men, men’s absolute subservience to the leaders above them (the dozen or so “shepherds”), and the shepherds’ absolute allegiance to Cooper (who renamed himself Hopeful Christian) – until he died in 2018 and was replaced by shepherd Howard Temple. No conversation is allowed between young people of different sexes after puberty. Women, who must wear uniform dresses and expose no skin but for the hands and face lest they inflame men’s uncontrollable lusts, are married off as young as possible – generally to the men Cooper/Christian deemed most suitable – and expected to devote themselves to having as many babies as possible. Everyone lives under the threat of eternal damnation. You get the picture, I’m sure. Continue reading...","Sun, 16 Feb 2025 22:00:17 GMT",-0.4902,-0.8939

The Guardian,Islands review – sexual tension and dangerously polite encounters,"This intriguing noir mystery with a twist in its tale sees a couple befriend a tennis coach at a holiday resort with unnerving resultsGerman film-maker Jan-Ole Gerster has created an intriguing noir mystery starring Sam Riley and Stacy Martin. It has very good performances and witty visual ideas, but the dramatic shape and emotional focus could have been tightened and sharpened. Yet this is a smart film which pays its audience the compliment of assuming they are intelligent enough to work things out on their own in a drama of sexual tension and dangerously polite encounters, something like Jacques Deray’s The Swimming Pool or Paul Schrader’s The Comfort of Strangers.Riley plays Tom, a tennis coach at a middling hotel resort in Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands. He has been here for almost a decade, increasingly unhappy with his aimless, pointless life of no worries, no responsibilities, spending nights just boozing, doing drugs and having endless one-night stands with women. Tragically, he is nicknamed “Ace” because he once got to play briefly on the hotel court with Rafael Nadal and gossip has embellished that anecdote into a (fictional) glorious victory over the tennis legend in front of hundreds of onlookers. But Tom is now descending into alcoholism, always waking up hungover in his car, or on the beach, or by the pool with no memory of the night before.

The Guardian,The Passenger review – wartime drama has a noirish haze but no real darkness,"Finborough theatre, LondonA symbolic, stripped-down staging fails to plumb the chilling emotional depths of this story about a Jewish man trying to flee Germany in the 1930sA wealthy Jewish businessman takes a series of Kafkaesque journeys on the German train system soon after Kristallnacht, driven from his home and in flight for his life. Otto Silbermann never makes it out of the country but – maddeningly – loops round and round, stuck in the trap of rising Nazi terror and afraid of every passenger he meets. He carries a suitcase of money, the last vestige of power he has in a homeland that has turned against Jews.The Passenger is based on Ulrich Alexander Boschwitz’s novel, which was written at blazing speed when Boschwitz, himself a German Jew, was just 23.

The Guardian,The Ice Tower review – Marion Cotillard focus of obsession and idolisation in death-wish fairytale,"Cotillard plays a movie actor starring in a production of The Snow Queen in Lucile Hadzihalilovic’s unwholesome story of yearningAn eerie and unwholesome spell is cast in this film; it is a fairytale of death-wish yearning and erotic submission. It wittily fuses the real and the fictional into a trance-state – and that’s the state that I’ve sometimes found a little static in previous films by Lucile Hadzihalilovic, but not here. Dreamily strange it might be (and in fact, on the face of it, entirely preposterous) this movie had me gripped with its two outstanding lead performances – from Marion Cotillard and newcomer Clara Pacini – and a clamorous musical score.Cotillard plays a diva-ish movie actress called Cristina, who is the lead in a new adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen’s The Snow Queen being filmed on a soundstage which is in a remote and snowy spot in late 60s France; she is gorgeously costumed in a sparkling white form-fitting gown and crown, a look she carries off with great unsmiling hauteur. Pacini plays Jeanne, a teenage girl in a foster home nearby, stricken with memories of the death of her mother, whose bead necklace she keeps. In her loneliness and grief, Jeanne has projected her feelings into an obsession with the story of the Snow Queen, an obsession further displaced at another remove into idolising the teen girls who ice-skate at the local rink. One day she runs away, stealing the ID of an older girl called Bianca and breaks into the film studio to sleep overnight; she somehow gets a job as an extra, astonished to realise what story is being filmed, and it is here that her gamine prettiness and air of demurely sensitive adoration for the queen catches Cristina’s eye.

Konaté could have increased their problems when, having been booked for dragging back Matheus Cunha, he collided late with the Wolves playmaker shortly before the interval.

The Guardian,In an NHS ward I saw how Britain relies on immigrants. Yet still we tell them they’re not wanted | John Harris,"My dad’s journey through the health and social care systems proves what politicians secretly know: we’ll be lost if they succeed in ‘sending them home’One bitter absurdity now sits at the heart of British life. It centres on the NHS, our strained systems of social care and an ever-more toxic and hateful conversation about immigration. Without hundreds of thousands of people who have come to the UK from abroad, the most basic aspects of how we look after old, infirm and ill people would simply collapse. Politics, however, increasingly seems to demand that this truth has to be denied – and the result is a level of hypocrisy that is remarkable even by modern standards.Three weeks before last Christmas, my dad – who turns 89 next month – fell down a flight of stairs, and broke his hip. After a terrifyingly long wait for an ambulance, he was admitted to hospital in Macclesfield, Cheshire, and operated on. In the midst of yet another awful NHS winter, the treatment he received felt faintly miraculous. And there was another aspect of his stay that seemed no less remarkable. Macclesfield is hardly the most diverse place in the world, but most of the doctors and nurses who so carefully looked after him were first-generation immigrants, mostly either from African countries, or India: people regularly overburdened and rushed off their feet, but who answered my endless questions and queries with an amazing grace and patience.John Harris is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Sun, 16 Feb 2025 13:04:54 GMT",0.0,0.8137

The Guardian,Why are women still being sent to prison as ‘a place of safety’? | Eva Wiseman,"Reports reveal the true harm done by incarcerating women under the guise of protecting themEvery now and then I learn something about the world today that sticks into me like a fish hook and I find myself asking friends, colleagues, “Wait, did you know this? Did you know this was happening?” The most recent felt like a horror-movie trope. It’s the part of the film, about a third of the way in, where a woman is locked up with the lie that the incarceration is for her own good.It’s not just films, of course, not just fiction – countless women were institutionalised in the 19th century for “abnormal” behaviours, like disagreeing with their husbands, or following “unnatural” sexual impulses. Some were locked up for postnatal depression, some alcoholism, some “moral insanity”, which meant, somehow, infidelity. But what shocked me even more than historical reports on women like Elizabeth Packard, who was incarcerated by her husband in 1860 (the doctor’s reasons included her refusal to shake his hand and the fact that she was above the age of 40), what got me asking, saying wait, was the knowledge that something similar is still happening daily, in prisons across the country.

The Guardian,The punishment doesn’t fit the crime in Britain. That’s why our jails are overflowing | Samira Shackle,"For 20 years, the UK has been inflating sentences despite little evidence it deters crime. But a new review offers a glimmer of hopeWe’ve heard a lot about prisons in recent months; specifically, the fact that they were full when the new government took office last summer. Labour introduced emergency measures to release thousands of prisoners early, which eased the immediate pressure. The government has committed to building four new prisons as well as adding blocks to existing prisons, creating 14,000 new prison spaces over the next seven years. But when the prison system gets bigger, so do the problems within it. And none of this answers the more complicated question of what happens next.So far, we have seen sticking-plaster solutions to a systemic crisis that has been created, in no small part, by the desire of successive governments to appear tough on crime. Any serious attempt to turn things around requires consideration of how we got here. The UK’s prison population is at record levels; it has almost doubled in the past 30 years. England and Wales have the highest per capita prison population in western Europe, and in the wider continent, only Russia and Turkey jail more people. Amid endemic overcrowding and understaffing, conditions are often poor, with inmates routinely confined to their cells – usually shared – for 23 hours a day. The suicide rate in our jails is twice the European average. Waiting lists for rehabilitative work – behaviour courses, education, training – are so long that some inmates might never access them at all. Most people would probably agree that none of this is desirable; it certainly doesn’t do much to lower the crime rate.Samira Shackle is a freelance journalist and the author of Karachi Vice Continue reading...","Sun, 16 Feb 2025 14:00:13 GMT",-0.6369,-0.9897
The Guardian,The north of England had high hopes for this government. Why is it only offering us crumbs from the south? | Peter Hetherington,"Neglect of schemes like the Tyne Bridge restoration contrasts sharply with bullishness over southern projectsIt’s a tale of two river crossings, and of two nations: a defining national landmark across the Tyne in need of an extra £6m from the government, and an ambitious plan being pushed by the chancellor for a Lower Thames Crossing at an estimated cost of at least £6bn. Together, they speak volumes about two-speed England and government priorities.Somewhat forlorn, partly covered in scaffolding, the majestic, rusting Tyne Bridge linking Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead is undergoing a long-delayed, four-year restoration meant to be completed for its centenary in 2028. The last government initially promised £35m towards the £41m cost – and while the prime minister recently described the structure as an “iconic part of the Newcastle and Gateshead skyline”, he refused to offer any assurance that the remaining £6m would be forthcoming in a review of infrastructure projects being undertaken by the Department for Transport. Local councils, cash-strapped and facing another round of austerity, are dismayed.Peter Hetherington writes for Society Guardian on communities and regeneration Continue reading...","Sun, 16 Feb 2025 12:00:07 GMT",0.4215,0.7506
The Guardian,Voices that oppose the assisted dying bill aren’t ‘noise’. They are vital scrutiny | Sonia Sodha,"Rather than rush through such a high-stakes law, it’s essential to listen to all sides of the debateYou can glean a lot from the way someone characterises their opponents in a debate. Do they engage with them constructively, assuming the best about their motives? Or imply they are acting out of bad faith? It’s telling that Kim Leadbeater, the MP who’s brought forward the bill to legalise assisted dying, seems to have gone for the latter approach.There could not be more at stake: legalising the prescription of lethal drugs to terminally ill people raises the spectre of vulnerable people being wrongfully subjected to an assisted death with state assistance. It is critical that the bill’s proponents engage constructively with the doctors, psychiatrists, social workers, lawyers and domestic abuse experts who have this concern. Yet Leadbeater appears&nbsp;affronted by the opposition to her bill; she has characterised it as “noise”, described those who oppose her change in the law as unconstructive, and has complained about their “clear mobilisation”. (Yes, when people are worried that legislation could have tragic&nbsp;consequences, that’s what they do.) The implication seemingly being that, unless you agree with her on the principle, there’s no legitimate role for you in scrutinising her bill.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,What would I tell my younger self if I met her for coffee? Mostly that things do get better | Emma Beddington,"Everyone hopes that they will get happier and wiser as well as older. And you know what? Sometimes they doI met my younger self for coffee. She wore a crisp white Agnès B shirt and patent ballet pumps; I wore H&amp;M elastic waisted trousers and the T-shirt I wore to the gym the day before. She ordered … hang on, hang on. First, isn’t this a time-travel no-no? And if it’s OK, I have questions. Say I met my 20-year-old self – is it 1995, meaning weak filter in the hippy cafe with cakes that taste like horse food? Or 2025, when every second shop serves violently acidic espressos? (Either way, I need to prepare my stomach.) And how have I lured her out? Because she may be naive, but no way would she agree to coffee with “your future self”. That’s plainly a trap.This whimsy, you may not be surprised to hear, is a TikTok trend. Based on a poem by Jennae Cecelia, it has been enthusiastically adopted by the youth (how are you dewy-faced babies meeting your younger selves – what are they, foetuses?). The formulaic videos are set to the kind of acoustic crooning that makes my husband instantly switch the radio to Capital Dance and wow, are they earnest about their lost, hurting youthful selves and self-actualised current incarnations. Aren’t gen Z supposed to be jokey nihilists? “We hugged and I told her I am becoming everything she had ever wanted me to be,” goes TikToker @earthtoapryl’s version (2m views). “I told her she’s full of purpose and has taught 10 million people to love themselves,” says another, and if you aren’t cringing your entire body inside out reading that, you’re probably not a gen X cynic.

The Guardian,"Europeans are right to be angry with Donald Trump, but they should also be furious with themselves | Andrew Rawnsley","The betrayal of Ukraine is a final warning to the UK and its continental allies to put a lot more energy and money into rebuilding their defencesIt was, Sir Keir Starmer told members of his inner circle, one of his most meaningful visits abroad. In the middle of last month, he flew to Kyiv to double-down on the commitment to back Ukraine’s struggle for freedom, a pledge he first made a defining feature of his leadership when Labour was in opposition. Hands were warmly clasped with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, wailing air raid sirens greeted a Russian drone attack, financial promises were made, and signatures were inscribed on a 100-year partnership treaty. The prime minister solemnly intoned the western mantra about backing the resistance to Russian tyranny “for as long as it takes” for Ukraine to become “free and thriving once again”.All of which now sounds for the birds, thanks to Donald Trump. It was with his trademark contempt for his country’s traditional allies that the US president blindsided them by announcing that he had initiated peace negotiations with Vladimir Putin over the heads of Ukraine and the European members of Nato. The UK received no more warning of this bombshell than anyone else. So much for the vaunted “special relationship”. The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, then unleashed another punch to the solar plexus of European security by publicly declaring that Ukraine would have to accept the surrender of large chunks of its territory and should forget about becoming a member of Nato. The future defence of Ukraine, he went on to declare, would be down to Europe, because the US wouldn’t be sending any of its troops to sustain a security guarantee.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on JD Vance in Munich: Europe must stand up for its values | Editorial,"The vice-president’s speech on Friday was another wake-up call for European leaders. On defence and in other areas, they need to chart their own courseIn 2007, Vladimir Putin delivered a speech to the Munich security conference that stunned western diplomats by launching an unforeseen assault on the post-1989 international order. The United States, alleged Mr Putin, had perniciously manufactured a unipolar world “in which there is one master, one sovereign”. Seven years later, Russian forces illegally occupied Crimea, and Moscow-funded separatists seized swathes of territory in eastern Ukraine, in what turned out to be the precursor to full-blown invasion.Nearly two decades later, the disturbing speech at the same venue by the US vice-president, JD Vance, may prove to be similarly significant as the geopolitics of the 21st century continue to shift. Mr&nbsp;Vance had been expected to concentrate last Friday’s remarks on Ukraine, after a week in which Donald Trump appeared to be unilaterally preparing to negotiate a ceasefire deal entirely on Mr Putin’s terms. Instead, he used his platform as a pulpit from which to berate the US’s European allies on issues such as multiculturalism, migration and the regulation of social media. Indefensibly, the Trump administration now actively cheerleads for far-right parties such as Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland, whose leader, Alice&nbsp;Weidel, he chose to meet in Munich.

Sir&nbsp;Keir&nbsp;Starmer’s government knows this and&nbsp;hopes its commitment to build 1.5m new homes will shore up support among voters.Making people more secure, so that disappointment and grievance do not make them easy targets for rightwing populists, is a vital task for social democratic parties everywhere.

Folded into a slightly-too-small chair in the regal-looking cafe of north London’s St Pancras Renaissance hotel, he shakes his head in dismay, causing his mass of tight curls to jiggle. “Rooke. Is. Gay,” he slowly repeats when reminded of the three words that make up the entirety of his Wikipedia page’s “personal life” section. “There’s a guy I’m currently dating who has mentioned it no less than four times. I’m like, ‘Can somebody just delete that?’”But while Wikipedia’s summation of Rooke’s personal life may be reductive, its section headed “works” is expansive. It culminates in Big Boys, the 31-year-old comedian and writer’s Bafta-nominated, semi-autobiographical coming-of-age comedy, which has just returned to Channel 4 for its third and final season. Based on Rooke’s 2015 Edinburgh fringe show, Good Grief, about the death of his father from cancer, and his 2020 memoir-slash-advice guide, Cheer the F**k Up, it follows grieving, gay student Jack (Dylan Llewellyn) as he navigates life at Brent University and tries to lose his anal virginity.

A wetsuit may seem the obvious choice for winter swimming, but many open-water wetsuits won’t offer much warmth in water below 10C, and the effort of putting one on at this time of year when swims are short often isn’t worth it (see more detail below).

Robson was handsome, ambitious, and determined to do well by his family. The job was an attractive opportunity: after years working on vessels, and as a pipelayer, he was pursuing safer and more lucrative positions piloting the remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) that are used to monitor underwater structures. It was a long stint away, but at least he’d be back to enjoy Christmas in South Tyneside with his partner, Kristie Graham, 39, her daughter Willow, 10, and Sefa, their 17-month-old son, in the new house they’d just bought.Until then, his home would be the Seafox Burj, a three-legged jack-up rig planted in the shallow waters of the Al-Shaheen oil field, 80km from land. Robson hated being away, but stayed connected to Graham and his friends over WhatsApp. From his vantage point in the middle of the Gulf, he’d take photos of dramatic sunsets and send them to Graham.
