The Guardian,Donald Trump’s Gaza plan: the key takeaways,"The US president has unveiled a plan for the US to take long-term ownership of the Gaza Strip. Here are are the key points from the press conference with Benjamin NetanyahuMiddle East crisis – live updatesFull report: Trump makes shock Gaza announcementDonald Trump and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, addressed reporters at the White House, where the US president announced his intention to take over the Gaza Strip, move Palestinians to neighbouring countries and redevelop the territory for occupation by “the world’s people”. Here are the main takeaways from their joint press conference on Tuesday evening:In a shock announcement, Trump said the US will “take over” and “own” the Gaza Strip. The US president said he envisioned a “long-term” US ownership of the territory after all Palestinians were moved elsewhere. He did not explain how and under what authority the US can take over the land of Gaza. “We will own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site,” he said. He said the US would “level” destroyed buildings and “create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area.”The US president called Gaza a “symbol of death and destruction” and that the only reason people want to go back there is because they have nowhere else to go. The 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza should move to neighbouring countries with “humanitarian hearts” and “great wealth”, Trump said. Earlier he had called for Jordan, Egypt and other Arab states to take in Palestinians. He said they could be split up across a number of separate sites. Forced displacement of the population would probably be a violation of international law and would be fiercely opposed not only in the region but also by Washington’s western allies. Some human rights advocates liken the idea to ethnic cleansing.He went on to say that Gaza could become “the Riviera of the Middle East” where “the world’s people” could live there, echoing the previous sentiments of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who said Gaza had very valuable “waterfront property”.Trump gave a vague answer when asked a question on whether he supported a two-state solution. Asked if his view that Palestinians should be relocated from Gaza was a sign that he was against the two-state policy that has been the foreign policy approach of the United States for decades, Trump said no. “It doesn’t mean anything about a two-state or one state or any other state. It means that we want to have, we want to give people a chance at life,” he said. “They have never had a chance at life because the Gaza Strip has been a hellhole for people living there. It’s been horrible.”Trump claimed high-level support among unnamed leaders he had spoken to. “This is not a decision made lightly,” he said, adding that “everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land.” He said the move would bring “great stability to that part of the Middle East”.Trump did not rule out sending US troops to secure Gaza. “As far as Gaza is concerned, we’ll do what is necessary. If it’s necessary, we’ll do that,” he said. On Trump’s idea of taking over Gaza, Netanyahu said the US president “sees a different future for Gaza”, adding: “I think it’s something that could change history.”Trump said he would probably announce a position on Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank in the next month. “We haven’t been taking the position on it yet,” he said. Trump added that he planned to visit the Gaza Strip, Israel and Saudi Arabia.Netanyahu described Trump as “the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House”. The Israeli leader said “we have to finish the job in Gaza”, and said “Israel will end the war by winning the war.” Netanyahu praised Trump for “thinking outside the box with fresh ideas” and “showing willingness to puncture conventional thinking”.The Saudi government, in a statement, stressed its rejection of any attempt to displace Palestinians from their land and said it would not establish relations with Israel without establishment of a Palestinian state. Meanwhile Hamas condemned Trump’s calls for Palestinians in Gaza to leave as “expulsion from their land”. The Palestinian envoy to the United Nations said that world leaders and people should respect Palestinians’ desire to remain in Gaza. Continue reading...","Wed, 05 Feb 2025 02:15:24 GMT",0.0,0.9881

Now as prominent as the president himself, Musk has begun to make use of that power, making decisions that could affect the health of millions of people, gaining access to highly sensitive personal data, and attacking anyone who opposes him. Musk, the world’s richest man and an unelected official, has achieved an astonishing level of power over the federal government.Over the weekend, workers with Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) clashed with civil servants over demands for unfettered access to the computer systems of major US government agencies in a breakneck series of confrontations. When the dust settled, several top officials who opposed the takeover had been pushed out, and Musk’s allies had gained control. Continue reading...","Tue, 04 Feb 2025 19:52:24 GMT",0.1531,0.9231

The Guardian,Mussolini: Son of the Century review – a brilliantly performed portrait of a pathetic monster,"Joe Wright’s portrayal of the rise of a ridiculous loser features a magnificently disgusting take on the titular fascist and is packed with lavish visuals – even if it does drag a tadBefore the real horrors of 20th-century fascism arrived, the long speeches were a sign that something was badly wrong: thousands of ordinary people at rallies, who don’t simply walk away when a man with obvious personality problems stands there spitting specious slogans, shows you when a country is in extremis. Totalitarianism’s propensity for being tedious as well as grotesque is captured rather too well by the director Joe Wright’s lavish, stagey Mussolini: Son of the Century, an eight-part dramatisation of Antonio Scurati’s prize-winning book. It’s quite a spectacle, but it doesn’t half go on. 
 Luca Marinelli is magnificently disgusting as Benito Mussolini, who founds the Italian Fasces of Combat – a gang of thugs bent on beating up socialists and channelling the fury of neglected first world war veterans – in 1919. Six years later, which in this drama is&nbsp;the best part of six episodes, he has established himself as Italy’s fascist dictator, in a way that will give his European neighbours some pointers on the obstacles to power that must be overcome.In episode one, Mussolini lists most of those obstacles when he outlines what fascism stands against: the church, the monarchy, the Italian state as it was then and the concept of elections are all, he says, brakes on the strong government his country needs.

As I wrote last year’s wrap, there had already been major big-money sales – $10m for A Real Pain, $17m for It’s What’s Inside, $15m for My Old Ass, $5m for Presence – some smaller ones – Thelma, Ghostlight, Ibelin, Daughters, Skywalkers and Kneecap – and in the 48 hours after there were even more – Dìdi to Focus and Will &amp; Harper to Netflix. Post-strikes it was a reassuringly robust marketplace with gaps that needed to be filled but just a year later, things are looking far less comforting.There were even more questions over quality – I heard many a grumble in the press line over a lack of breakouts – but even so, as of writing, there have been only four deals confirmed, a worryingly dour result for what’s seen as one of America’s most important markets.

The Irish-British film-maker and his Scottish partner Allison McGourty had spent 10 months researching a film about that massively successful but elusive rock band Led Zeppelin. They put together a storyboard, listened to every interview they could find, and started to dig out archive film to tell the story of the band’s early years in the late 60s.That was when Jimmy Page, a successful session guitarist, joined the Yardbirds, then wanted to create a band of his own. He signed up John Paul Jones, another virtuoso session star, and two little-known West Midlands musicians: the wildly inventive drummer John Bonham, and singer Robert Plant. Overlooked in Britain, Led Zeppelin found fame in America, where they were attacked in the music press but became celebrities through their live shows, without the help of the media.

Certainly a hot new twist on the old 13th fairy act.Given that Bianca is rarely photographed in anything heavier than a 5-denier sex poncho, half the internet seems to have settled definitively on the conviction that she is being coercively controlled. The other half has decided the pair enjoy the attention their “art project” is receiving.

Gene therapy could be a lifeline, if it’s accessible to allTobi Oredein is a journalist, public speaker and the founder and CEO of Black BalladWhen I was pregnant for the first time in 2020, I remember saying to my husband: “This country does not give a toss about the health of black people.” Why? As a pregnant woman and a sickle cell carrier, I was shocked to learn how little information is shared about this disease. Logging into pregnancy apps or reading NHS leaflets, you find an endless list of illnesses and conditions – genetic and non-genetic – that may affect your baby. Yet sickle cell was barely mentioned, despite it being the fastest-growing genetic disease in the UK.During the pandemic, we were constantly told that those with underlying health conditions were more at risk. But sickle cell was rarely, if ever, acknowledged as one of those conditions. Sickle cell disease – which predominantly affects black people – causes red blood cells to become a sickle shape, making it difficult for them to pass through blood vessels. This leads to excruciating pain episodes, known as sickle cell crises, which can last hours, days or even weeks.Tobi Oredein is a journalist, public speaker and the founder and CEO of Black BalladDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But it was the less high-profile investments that absorbed the majority of the cash, including about 200 hedge funds with complex corporate structures almost always involving the British Virgin Islands (BVI).An investigation by the Guardian, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the BBC, published last week, revealed how Abramovich may have exploited Britain’s offshore havens to funnel wealth through Cyprus to the BVI and dodge up to £1bn in UK tax. That sum exceeds even Bernie Ecclestone’s historic tax settlement. Continue reading...","Tue, 04 Feb 2025 17:47:40 GMT",0.128,0.775

Diageo, the Guinness, Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff combo, was able to cite “the current macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty” – exhibit A being the possible US tariffs on Canada and Mexico – as it dropped its guidance for growth.What that reasonable-sounding explanation misses, however, is that nobody believed Diageo’s old forecasts anyway – and they hadn’t for a long time before Trump re-entered the White House.

Ten years later, it still makes me shudder.Still, I felt a little better about it when I saw the run that Apple’s artificial intelligence system went on recently.

There is an answer, but it involves improving human behaviourCall it a tale of two puppies. You can tell a lot about 2020s Britain by looking at its two defining “designer” dogs: the cavapoo (or spoodle, or any of the other poodle-crosses), and the American XL bully.Both took off in popularity with a surge in dog ownership during the pandemic, prompting unscrupulous breeders to cash in on the demand; and both have been widely bred to prioritise appearance over good character or health. And, in their cartoonish contrast, both might be seen as emblematic of where our relationship with dogs has in recent decades gone awry. One is treated to puppuccinos and trips to the pub, while the other has been demonised as a killing machine. Continue reading...","Tue, 04 Feb 2025 08:00:15 GMT",-0.8427,0.5423
The Guardian,The Guardian view on Labour’s Brexit hesitancy: Tories collapse and Farage fills the void | Editorial,"Sir Keir Starmer’s caution has yet to persuade voters, while discontent fuels a resurgent right that thrives by boosting anti-immigrant, climate-sceptic viewsOver the past 15 years, British politics has been defined by the tension between ideals and practicality. The right has dominated theory, bolstered by a supportive press, yet struggled in execution. Meanwhile, Labour has become pragmatic but uninspiring, clinging to a “leftwing” label while prioritising competence over vision. That may not be a flaw in itself, but polling suggests it isn’t winning over voters.Yet Labour’s poor standing hasn’t benefited the Tories. Broken by their time in office, the Conservatives appear to be fading into irrelevance. They failed to address capitalism’s central flaw: that without government intervention, wealth accumulates for those at the top while many feel abandoned below. Instead, Tory chancellors pursued austerity policies, deepening social division and fuelling the discontent that led to the disaster of voting to leave the EU.

Their grudging experiment with limited democracy reached its end when Aung San Suu&nbsp;Kyi’s party won a landslide second election victory –&nbsp;prompting the ousting and imprisonment of the National League for Democracy (NLD) leader and her&nbsp;colleagues in February 2021.Four years on, resistance has flourished.

The Guardian,Why did so many young people take part in the English riots of 2024? | Letters,"Mohammed Ali Amla says we need to understand how far-right movements are exploiting children, and Alice Flinta says racism is a systemic issue fuelled by online misinformation  Young people are rarely drawn into the far right purely by racist or ideological motivations; the reality is far more complex (Hatred of police not racism motivated children in English riots, report finds, 28 January). Factors such as personal grievances, vulnerabilities, social media influence, a search for identity and a desire to belong all play a role. However, once they become involved, racism, hatred and intolerance quickly become deeply ingrained.It is important not to downplay the role of online disinformation, anti-immigrant sentiment, Islamophobia and racist views. Social media was flooded with images of children chanting racist and Islamophobic slogans, attacking those perceived to be Muslim, inciting community disorder and targeting mosques with violence. Downplaying this avoids the reality that the prevalent culture wars are feeding intolerance, hatred and prejudice towards anyone considered the other – in this case Muslims and immigrants.

The Guardian,‘An unbelievable finisher’: why Mathys Tel is a perfect fit for Spurs,"Often a victim of his own versatility, emerging from Harry Kane’s shadow at Bayern should allow Tel’s talent to shine“It’s very rare that this many&nbsp;clubs call you for a player,” Bayern Munich’s sporting director, Max Eberl, told Kicker last week when talking about the options available to Mathys Tel. It spoke not just of widespread recognition among Europe’s elite clubs of the 19‑year‑old’s quality but of a shift of policy in the Bundesliga leaders’ camp; from shutting their ears to all approaches at the beginning of January to accepting that leveraging a financial advantage out of the situation was the best they could do. A month-long transfer window leaves room for plenty of changes of heart and mind.Some will snort that Tottenham were a mere backup choice after Tel declined their initial approach, that the forward blinked when faced with the prospect of a second half of the Bundesliga season like his first, given a mere 253 minutes of playing time. More probable is that an especially reflective young man took time to think of what would work best for him rather than what would most suit Bayern. There is little contradictory about the process when you consider Tel is an explosive attacking weapon with the maturity to constantly adapt.

The Guardian,David Lynch’s death shocks smokers into quitting: ‘It’s just not good for us’,"Smoking was having a comeback – until the director’s death after an emphysema diagnosis complicated its allureDavid Lynch was a smoker. With an American Spirit perpetually locked between his teeth, he figured fire and smoke as magical textures in his films. To Lynch, cigarettes weren’t merely delicious, but sacred: they gave him the impression of breathing in the world, then blowing it back out again with fabulous grace.Born in 1946 – 20 years before the US surgeon general pronounced for the first time that cigarettes could cause cancer – Lynch came up in a time when American glamor was buttressed by cigarettes and cinema. Actors like Joan Crawford and Bette Davis danced a beautiful and foolish waltz with death, smoke in hand, while cigarettes were considered the sine qua non of the artist’s life, an ashtray piled up with butts evidence of a good day’s work. “I always associated smoking and drinking coffee with the art life. They go hand in hand,” Lynch told the Independent in 2013. Continue reading...","Tue, 04 Feb 2025 13:00:05 GMT",-0.8362,0.9559
The Guardian,…blackbird hour review – a daring and dizzying portrait of isolation,"Bush theatre, LondonA woman comes adrift from reality in babirye bukilwa’s chilling character studyWe are at sea at the start of babirye bukilwa’s visceral play about one Black queer woman’s experience of illness, care and the struggle to love herself. Eshe (Evlyne Oyedokun) hasn’t left the flat in days. Instead, she sits on her bed and rows. As her surroundings are submerged in oceanic blue light, waves crash behind her, and she swigs brandy from a hip flask. She is by herself and floating through unknown waters, but here she’s also free to express her pain on her own terms. “I want to be alone, with my own breath and that,” she says.The play, which was a finalist for the Women’s prize for playwriting, the Bruntwood prize and the Alfred Fagon award, is a full-throttled immersion inside Eshe’s head. We hear the voice and feel the almost suffocating presence of her dead mother, Sissy (Danielle Kassaraté). The room is covered in crisp packets, empty takeaway boxes and dirty laundry, but her focus is averted elsewhere. Eshe is bombarded by text messages, and her loved ones, Ella (Olivia Nakintu) and Michael (Ivan Oyik), beg to be let into her space, but no one seems to know the right way to reach out and love her in the way she needs.

The Guardian,"‘Does my character have to be so horny?’ Big Boys star Jon Pointing on lust, laddishness and leaping into blockbusters","As the coming-out, coming-of-age hit student sitcom returns for a charged final season, the actor who plays super-straight bestie Danny reveals how his unique brand of blokeyness gets him hugs and thank-yous in gay clubsOn the morning Jon Pointing is due to videocall, I make the mistake of starting to watch the last ever episode of Big Boys. Within seconds I’m in tears, even though the show is a comedy: a coming-of-age story about a guy called Jack, who leaves his working-class family home and starts university. In scenes that verge on slapstick, Jack tries on various identities, attempts to lose his virginity and eventually tells his family he is gay. Yet Jack is also grieving for his father and Big Boys has moments so wrenching that you may find yourself, as I did, suddenly in pieces.Since 2022, Pointing has been putting the lad into the hit Channel 4 comedy. In a role that has made its way to front and centre, he plays Danny, Jack’s flatmate and best mate, inverting the trope of the gay best friend. At 25, Danny is a mature student: a straight blokey bloke who supports Jack in his coming out and introduces him to life as a fresher, all while struggling with his own mental health problems. When Danny comes off antidepressants in the hope his sexual performance will improve, things don’t go to plan. “Sometimes,” says Pointing, “I’d be like, ‘Does Danny have to be so horny?’” He thought the key to playing the character was to make him “too happy – trying a bit too hard to have a good time”.

The Guardian,Brokeback Mountain at 20: the ‘gay cowboy flick’ now rightly regarded as a tragic masterpiece,"Ang Lee’s remarkable movie, starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger as star-crossed lovers, was controversial and lost best picture at the Oscars – but remains a beautiful filmGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailSome films accumulate an emotional residue over time; rather than diminishing, their impact deepens and intensifies with each screening. When I first saw Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain in 2005 – a movie I’d been anticipating since a “gay cowboy” project was announced – my response was subdued. I remember telling a friend who’d asked what I thought that it was beautiful in the way a landscape painting is beautiful: lush and precisely detailed but emotionally spare. These days I can’t hear the opening strains of Gustavo Santaolalla’s poignant score without weeping.
 Beautiful landscape is, of course, a central feature of the film, tantalising and talismanic. The quietly stunning Wyoming countryside is not only where our cowboys fall in love – mercurial and passionate Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and taciturn and self-loathing Ennis del Mar (Heath Ledger) – it represents the kind of emotional freedom and acceptance they can’t find in the prosaic interiors of their upbringing. Brokeback Mountain (a fictional location invented by the author Annie Proulx in the award-winning short story on which the film is based) releases something in the men, then mocks them for not living up to its Edenic promise.It’s highly significant that the film opens in 1963 and spans a 20-year period of marriages, kids and divorce before ending in secrecy and heartbreak. This was a time of enormous progress for gay men in the US who’d fought for and won legal protections across the country. But for Jack and Ennis – who can’t even conceive of a world that tolerates, let alone actively celebrates, their love – this progress might as well be happening on the moon. It’s a salient reminder that what we think of as an LGBTQI+ community is largely a metropolitan, middle-class construct.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Continue reading...","Tue, 04 Feb 2025 14:00:09 GMT",0.2732,0.9971

It means January is over, which is cause for celebration already. The end-of-season sale rails have gone, so shop windows are again a source of new ideas. The weather is still rubbish, obviously, but the light is coming back: with a pinch of luck, you may even see daylight on the way home from the office by the end of February. The first snowdrops are nearly here. I like Valentine’s Day, which I know is deeply uncool of me, but I like pink and I like chocolate, so what’s not to love?But February can be a challenge to dress for. The novelty of snuggly knits and shiny boots has well and truly worn off at this point, and maintaining enthusiasm for cold-weather dressing is a chore. Please keep reading for a puffer coat update and a fresh layering formula, not to mention a top-tier edit of the most delectable and affordable treats I’ve scouted from February’s shelves.

The Guardian,The food filter: which supermarket has the best extra-virgin olive oil?,"From luxury Sicilian to budget buys, our Rome correspondent tests supermarket extra-virgin olive oils – and reveals how much you should spend • The best hot sauces, tasted and rated by Thomasina MiersYears ago, a good cook, who happened to be Greek, told me to think of olive oil not simply as liquid fat, but as an essential ingredient, as flavour and as a seasoning, with the ability to act like herbs and spices. He’s absolutely right and his excellent advice continues to motivate me when I’m choosing extra-virgin olive oil, which is the single most important ingredient I buy, and my biggest expense in the kitchen. While I do have the odd special bottle for drizzling, I am more interested in a good-tasting all-rounder that I can use for everything (my cooking is largely vegetable-, pasta-, pulse-, cheese- and egg-centric), including deep-frying (in a very small pan).Just to recap, olive oil is the liquid fat obtained by pressing olives, which are fruits. Once picked, they need to be processed as soon as possible – that is, crushed, then centrifugally spun to separate the pulp, water and oil, all in scrupulously clean machinery and at a steady temperature, which preserves the natural aromas of the olives. It takes about eight kilos of olives to make a litre of oil, which, to be considered extra-virgin olive oil, needs to have no defects and no more than 0.8% of free fatty acids. And that comes at a price: expect to pay between £14 and £18 a litre. Continue reading...","Sat, 01 Feb 2025 10:00:39 GMT",0.6369,0.9847

The Guardian,My boyfriend knows I don’t orgasm – but not that I feel no pleasure in sex at all,"When a partner touches me during foreplay, they may as well be touching my knee. What can I do?I’m a 22-year-old woman who has never had an orgasm. Growing up, I didn’t feel attracted to boys, so I assumed I must like women. As I got older I dated girls and boys, but  it would end after the first make-out session, where I would find myself trying to watch television over their shoulder instead. I thought I must be asexual until I realised I do want to have sex when I fancy people, but as soon as it gets to touching private parts, mine feel no different than if someone were touching my knee. The  missing ingredient is pleasure. I have tried masturbation  but nothing  works (I found myself laughing at porn as I couldn’t take it seriously). I have dated and had intercourse with a small number of people I trust and even discussed this issue with them. They were all understanding, but ultimately it led to the end of a few relationships as my partners felt guilty for not giving me pleasure and assumed I just didn’t like them. I am currently in a long-term relationship with a man who is gorgeous, ridiculously kind, a giver in bed and knows that I’ve never had an orgasm. What he doesn’t know is that I don’t feel any pleasure full stop. I worry that this is going to put a downer on our relationship. 
 You seem smart and insightful about your plight, and I’m sorry this is so hard for you. Human sexual responses are very complex. They involve physiological and anatomical mechanisms as well as psychologically and biologically driven elements. Hormonal factors play a large role, but so do less commonly understood issues such as distractibility. If there is a problem in any of the many foundational areas – for example, genital nerve damage – the system of desire, arousal, or orgasm can be affected. Since you want to experience pleasure, and since the source of your anhedonia (the inability to experience pleasure) is a mystery to you, I recommend you start exploring – with help from a sexual medicine specialist – each dimension in turn until you find answers and a way forward.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments).

When a space rock came to an English market town in 2021, scientists raced to find as much out as they couldAt 21.54 on 28 February 2021, 16 cameras belonging to amateur sky-watching network UKMON picked up a bright shape headed towards Earth. Pictures show a long white line, which was visible for eight seconds, a glowing globule of light against the dark sky. “For me it’s like fishing,” said Richard Kacerek, one of the founders of UKMON. “You cast your line and then you wait. There are days when you catch nothing but there are days when you catch a really, really big fish and it’s so exciting.” The fireball of February 2021 was such a fish: a lump of flaming extraterrestrial rock travelling at a speed of about 8.4 miles a second – 15 times the speed of a rifle bullet – and headed for the Cotswolds market town of Winchcombe.Meteorites are rocks from space that have entered our atmosphere. Most were once part of asteroids – the rocky, airless remnants left over from the formation of our solar system 4.6bn years ago. Almost all of them are what collectors call “finds”, meaning that the stone has been discovered by searching the ground, having fallen earlier – in most cases several thousand years earlier. A “fall”, a meteorite that is seen in flight and then recovered, is very, very rare. Worldwide, typically only about 10 such rocks are picked up each year.

In others, it’s so close up that all you see are rivets or the cross-hatching of metal beams. In his series Thirty-Six Views of the Golden Gate Bridge (the title nods to Katsushika Hokusai’s famous woodcut prints of Mount Fuji), US photographer Arthur Drooker set out to defamiliarise the great Californian landmark, asking: “Is it possible to see the most photographed bridge in the world anew?” After two years on the project, he came away with “deep admiration” for its builders who defied predictions that the mile-wide strait could never be bridged. “What I found most resonant,” says Drooker, “even more than the span’s status as an engineering and architectural icon, is its power as a symbol of possibility.”Thirty-Six Views of the Golden Gate Bridge is available from arthurdrooker.com Continue reading...","Sat, 01 Feb 2025 17:00:47 GMT",0.0,0.6124
