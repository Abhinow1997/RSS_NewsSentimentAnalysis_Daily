Actor Debi Mazar took the stage for jewellery brand Completedworks, playing a television shopping channel hostess on the verge of a nervous breakdown, hawking the “mermaid realness” of pearl earrings while sipping a martini.

She added that “it was devastating to … feel so betrayed by the system”.

One Red Rose win in seven attempts and four consecutive victories for Gregor Townsend’s side has certainly been an uncomfortable sequence for those who, for decades, regarded death and taxes as only marginally more inevitable than Scotland losing down south.So much for the supposed dead weight of history. “What’s done cannot be undone,” murmured Lady Macbeth but she wasn’t privy to the skill and daring of Finn Russell or the killer finishing of Duhan van der Merwe.

At the very least, can we please stop comparing him unfavourably with Andy Carroll. This should be taken as a general cease-and-desist plea from those of us with an interest in preserving the Carroll legacy. But it also feels like an important note of distinction in a week when Arne Slot has unexpectedly made Núñez into a person of interest in the Premier League title race by dwelling on his now-famous miss against Aston Villa.There may be sound internal reasons for this. Slot is very shrewd. The season has so far been an exercise in control and smart judgment.

Jos Buttler called it a brutal format before England’s opener against Australia in Lahore on Saturday, while his opposite number, Steve Smith, spoke of needing a “quarter-final” mentality.As unforgiving as it is, there is a fair bit riding on this Champions Trophy for Buttler, a captain who lifted the T20 World Cup in 2022 straight after replacing Eoin Morgan but has struggled to live up to it since. Series results have nose-dived, both world titles were surrendered meekly, and the messaging has often been confusing.

Villa may be grateful for that: had they taken a point from that game they would have been facing Bayern in the last 16. That said, as domestic form has stagnated, the victory over Bayern, a repeat of the scoreline from the 1982 European Cup final, probably represents the high point of their season so far. Domestically this hasn’t been a great campaign for Brugge either. They lie eight points behind Racing Genk but for them too the Champions League has provided salvation. They sneaked into the playoffs with three wins but then were much the better side against Atalanta, winning home and away. Continue reading...","Fri, 21 Feb 2025 18:01:08 GMT",0.5267,0.9744

He has brought Russia in from the diplomatic cold after three years of ostracism following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, whose anniversary is nearly upon us. Sergei Lavrov, Putin’s foreign minister, was meant to be persona non grata; he remains under international sanctions. Nevertheless, this week in Riyadh he met Trump’s secretary of state, Marco Rubio, in so-called peace talks.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Fri, 21 Feb 2025 15:21:45 GMT",0.3818,-0.8625
The Guardian,Even Reform voters think the workers’ rights bill is good news. So why isn’t Labour shouting about it? | Polly Smythe,"Why would the government water down and downplay such a popular policy? Because the business lobby doesn’t like it At last year’s TUC conference, the employment rights minister, Justin Madders, described Labour’s workers’ rights package as “the sort of thing that would make you say to the person on the street: ‘It does matter who you vote for.’” Despite the bill’s initial offering having been diluted, he is right: day one employment rights, an end to “exploitative” zero-hours contracts and a clampdown on fire-and-rehire.In the midst of abysmal polling, you would think Labour, desperate to prove that after more than a decade of Tory dysfunction the government can improve people’s daily lives, would loudly embrace its overhaul of worker protections. But that is not what has happened. Instead, even as the government has launched a frenzied publicity offensive over its “tough” immigration stance, it has remained comparably silent over its employment reforms, seeming to shy away from letting news of the bill even reach the person on the street.Polly Smythe is labour movement correspondent at Novara Media Continue reading...","Fri, 21 Feb 2025 13:00:38 GMT",0.4404,-0.0772
The Guardian,An exiled group within Labour is making a comeback – it could hold the key to repelling Farage | Julian Coman,"Many of Blue Labour’s diagnoses have been proved correct. With Reform targeting Labour’s working-class support, a reappraisal is overdueAs one poll this month placed Nigel Farage’s Reform UK ahead of Labour and the Conservatives for the first time, I sought distraction on holiday in Jonathan Coe’s latest novel. Set during the brief seven-week premiership of Liz Truss, The Proof of My Innocence is a Graham Greene-style “entertainment”, rather than another Coe state-of-the-nation book like Middle England or Bournville. But it does deal with a serious political theme: the morphing of British conservatism, from the 1980s onwards, into the radical, insurgent force that culminated in Brexit, Boris Johnson and Kwasi Kwarteng’s budget.Coe writes wonderfully well, and with empathy about very different social worlds. But his overall perspective generally stays within an embattled liberal-left comfort zone. Towards the end of the book, a twentysomething character offers her take on the disruptions that led to our present discontent: “Britain changed. What we had before: consensus more or less. What came after: libertarianism/individualism. Every man and woman for his/herself.” Earlier, the revelation of a secret plot to sell the NHS out to big pharma – involving a high-profile Brexiter – underlines a gradual eclipse of public virtue by private monied interests.Julian Coman is a Guardian associate editor Continue reading...","Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:00:34 GMT",0.0,0.9403

The Guardian,Another ceasefire is under threat from Trump – the precarious deal between Lebanon and Israel | Mohamad Bazzi,"Israel, seemingly with the US president’s blessing, has kept troops inside Lebanon. Renewed conflict with Hezbollah is loomingAs global attention remains focused on the hostage-prisoner swaps between Hamas and Israel, another ceasefire in the region hangs in the balance.The 14-month war between Israel and Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim militia which has been the most dominant political faction in Lebanon for the past two decades, was paused by a US-brokered ceasefire in late November. The agreement also paved the way to end years of political deadlock in Beirut. Lebanon has formed a new government, and finally has leaders chosen for their promises to carry out reforms, rather than their sectarian affiliations – but the future of the ceasefire deal has left them facing an immediate crisis.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor at New York UniversityDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"The ‘west’ is over. In the Trumpian era, Europe is on its own | Alexander Hurst","Trump and JD Vance are clear: the US is no longer an ally, but an antagonist to democratic valuesIn 1966, after years of friction with the US over whether France should have its own independent nuclear deterrent, the French president, Charles de Gaulle, withdrew his country from Nato’s integrated command (not, however, from the alliance itself – a common misconception) and asked all US forces stationed in France to leave. In response, the US secretary of state, Dean Rusk, asked de Gaulle: “Does that include the dead Americans in military cemeteries as well?”In a single weekend, JD Vance’s direct attacks on European democracy at the Munich Security Conference and his meeting with far-right, anti-European political forces in Germany, have given de Gaulle his historic vindication.Alexander Hurst is a Guardian Europe columnist Continue reading...","Fri, 21 Feb 2025 07:00:31 GMT",0.0,-0.8316
The Guardian,The Guardian view on Germany’s election: a chance to reset for a new era | Editorial,"Sunday’s poll is a turning point for the EU’s most powerful member state, as it comes to terms with Trump 2.0When Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, chose in November to force this weekend’s snap election, it felt like awkward timing. In the United States, Donald Trump had just won a decisive victory and was promising to move fast and break things. With a political storm brewing, was this the right time for the EU’s most important member state to embark on a&nbsp;period of prolonged introspection?Three tumultuous months later, with German democracy itself in the crosshairs of a hostile Trump administration, Sunday’s poll feels more like a valuable opportunity for an emergency reset. Any federal election carries huge significance beyond Germany’s borders. This poll is distinguished by being the first of a new era – one in which the transatlantic alliance that underpinned Europe’s postwar security can no longer be relied upon. Its outcome will be fundamental to shaping the EU’s response to that new reality, as existential decisions are made over defence spending and protecting Ukraine.

But there is still much to celebrate about British soap operas“It wasn’t exactly like On First Looking into Chapman’s Homer or turning to page one of War and Peace, but you have to say the BBC did its best to make the start of its new twice-weekly soap EastEnders go with a bang,” opined the Guardian’s TV critic in 1985.

This week EastEnders marked its 40th anniversary.But as with every celebration in Albert Square, a less cheery story is lurking in the background, despite an eventful live edition, nostalgic documentaries and best-of lists. The BBC’s one-time ratings giant, commanding 30 million viewers on Christmas Day in 1986, is suffering a midlife crisis. This year’s Christmas&nbsp;show figures were a sobering 4.39 million.

There was the palliative care nurse at our front door waiting to be let in, standing by our small red car. My husband had terminal cancer and this amazing nurse was incredibly supportive to all of us. The car was his little runaround while he was still able to drive.

They were very dignified and gracious, and they ran life with a rod of steel. They were very brave and had big reputations. The men were always a bit in the background.” Tressilian’s bell rings, and everyone from servants to her relations and lawyer (he’s there on the thorny matter of her will), is commanded to attention. “It’s a great way to presage a character, an inbuilt warning,” says Huston.

The Guardian,The Guide #179: How National Theatre Live brought the magic of the stage to the cinema,"In this week’s newsletter: The project bringing live-capture versions of the theatre’s shows to international audiences has been a resounding successLast month I went to the National Theatre to catch The Importance of Being Earnest, Oscar Wilde’s campy, farcical comedy. But unlike other theatre visits, this time I was surrounded by a number of large cameras.This was not due to some crisis in audience etiquette, but because I was watching the live-capture of the onstage performance. As I was enjoying Ncuti Gatwa’s Algernon pretending to play piano in a dazzling hot-pink dress, production teams in a number of trucks outside were frantically working to ensure the performance would be optimised for cinema screens across the world.

The Guardian,"The name’s Bezos, Jeff Bezos: what can we expect from Amazon’s James Bond?","With one of the film industry’s most lucrative franchises signed over to Amazon MGM, 007 could be facing down the barrel of spin-offs, quasi-crowdsourcing and a cinematic universe to rival MarvelThe ink could hardly have dried on the contract between Amazon MGM and Eon Productions, the legendary Bond film company run by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, before Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos put up a social media post that went to the heart of the conundrum faced by one of the film industry’s most lucrative franchises: “Who’d you pick as the next Bond?”The reality underlying Broccoli and Wilson’s decision to cede control to Amazon, the company that has since 2021 been responsible for co-producing Bond films after its purchase of MGM, is that since it became apparent that Daniel Craig wanted to leave the role, the franchise has been struck by a kind of creative paralysis. We are used to increasingly long gaps between their release, but with no new lead actor in sight, Bond 26 has still not even reached the starting gate. Eon kept the quest for a new Bond behind completely closed doors, like a sort of state secret, but Bezos’s first act has been to throw the gates open, with an Elon Musk-esque act of quasi-crowdsourcing. It may be just a PR-grabbing gesture, but it demonstrates that Amazon is planning to do things differently from now on. Continue reading...","Fri, 21 Feb 2025 14:18:52 GMT",0.0,0.7879

The Guardian,"15 of the best men’s jumpers, from cashmere and cable knit to merino wool","Whether you’re searching for a lamb’s wool layer or a stylish sweater vest, upgrade your knitwear with these instant classics• The best boots for men: 14 favourites, from Chelsea to brogues to westernKnitwear, like most menswear, is best done classic. As with other staples – denim, T-shirts, tailoring et al – it’s an investment that will go beyond any trend or season. So, if you buy the right pieces, you’ll likely wear them for years to come.With that in mind, there are a few things to consider when hitting the shops. Above all, it’s best to choose jumpers you know are made well, using good fabrics. That means you should go for brands you can trust in terms of craftsmanship and stick to natural fibres, such as cotton, wool and cashmere. Unlike human-made textiles, these are naturally breathable and temperature-regulating so they’re more comfortable and better for your skin. This sometimes means the price is a little higher than a fast-fashion buy, but they tend to last longer – just be sure to keep them protected when moth season hits.

But don’t let that put you off; in fact, I found the jeopardy rather exciting.Stark by Ben and Sophie Crittenden is the latest reprise of the pair’s former 12-seater in Broadstairs, Kent. The couple, seeking a better work/life balance, upped sticks here to the Côte d’Azur of Colchester, to open this brand-new Stark, which has slightly more covers (20 or so) and is, frankly, about as “independent” as a restaurant can get. We made the trek one Saturday evening, and were originally booked in for 6pm, until the Crittendens called to ask if we’d not prefer to eat later, because we’d be dining alone, a sweet attention to detail that only small operations such as this have time to pick up on (see also the Troublesome Lodger in Marlow).
