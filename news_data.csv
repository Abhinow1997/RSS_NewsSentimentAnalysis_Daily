The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Putin meets Slovak PM in rare Moscow visit to secure energy deal,"Slovakia is dependent on gas passing through neighbouring Ukraine, and it has ramped up efforts to maintain those flows from 2025, after a five-year agreement expiresSee all our Ukraine coverageRussian president, Vladimir Putin met the Slovakian prime minister, Robert Fico, in the Kremlin on Sunday, a rare visit by a European Union leader to Moscow, as a contract allowing for Russian gas to transit through Ukraine nears expiry. Slovakia is dependent on that gas passing through its neighbour Ukraine, and it has ramped up efforts to maintain those flows from 2025, while criticising Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy for refusing to extend the contract expiring at the end of the year. Russian natural gas still flows to some European countries, including Slovakia, through Ukraine under a five-year agreement signed before the war. “Russian President V Putin confirmed the readiness of the (Russian Federation) to continue to supply gas to the west and Slovakia, which is practically impossible after 1 January, 2025, in view of the stance of the Ukrainian president,” Fico said. Slovakia last month signed a short-term pilot contract to buy natural gas from Azerbaijan, and earlier this year, it struck a deal to import US liquefied natural gas through a pipeline from Poland. The country can also receive gas through Austrian, Hungarian and Czech networks, enabling imports from Germany among other potential suppliers.Russia has captured two more villages in east Ukraine, the latest territorial gains for Moscow’s advancing army. The defence ministry said on Telegram on Sunday that its troops had “liberated” the villages of Lozova in the north-eastern Kharkiv region and Krasnoye - called Sontsivka in Ukraine. The latter is close to the resource hub of Kurakhove, which Russia has almost encircled and would be a key prize for Moscow’s attempt to capture the entire Donetsk region. Russia has accelerated its advance across eastern Ukraine in recent months, looking to secure as much territory as possible before the US president-elect, Donald Trump, assumes office in January. Moscow’s army claims to have seized more than 190 Ukrainian settlements this year, with Kyiv struggling to hold the line in the face of manpower and ammunition shortages.Zelenskyy told Ukraine’s diplomats on Sunday that the country will have to fight to persuade allies to allow it to take up Nato membership, but has described the goal as “achievable” as it searches for security guarantees to protect it from Russia. Kyiv says membership in the transatlantic military alliance, or an equivalent form of security guarantee, would be crucial to any peace plan to ensure Russia does not attack again. Nato has said Ukraine will join it one day, but has not suggested when or issued an invitation.Russian forces executed five Ukrainian prisoners of war, Ukraine’s parliamentary commissioner for human rights, Dmytro Lubinets, claimed on Sunday. Russian troops shot the five unarmed soldiers after capturing them, Lubinets alleged on Telegram, without providing more details. “Russian war criminals who shoot Ukrainian prisoners of war should be brought before an international tribunal and punished with the most severe punishment provided for by law,” Lubinets said. Russia did not immediately comment on the incident, but has previously denied committing war crimes.A video purporting to show the Russian capture of an Australian man fighting for Ukraine on the war’s eastern front has prompted urgent inquiries by Australia’s government. The man, who identified himself as Oscar Jenkins, is struck several times and questioned roughly in Russian in the video, which is circulating on Telegram. Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese noted that Russian forces sometimes seeded incorrect information but said on Monday that the news was “concerning” and the government was working “to provide support, including, for this gentleman” as it ascertained the facts.Ukrainian drones struck a major Russian fuel depot for the second time in just over a week on Sunday, according to a senior Russian regional official, as part of a “massive” cross-border attack on fuel and energy facilities that Kyiv says supply Moscow’s military. The strikes came days after Russia launched sweeping attacks on Ukraine’s already battered energy grid, threatening to plunge thousands of homes into darkness as winter tightens its grip over the region, and as Russia’s all-out invasion of its neighbour nears the three-year mark.

The Guardian,Inside No 9: The Party’s Over review – the fascinating behind-the-scenes tale of a modern classic,"Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith guide viewers through an absolute treat: a deep dive into how they made 49 episodes of one of TV’s most unique showsOf all the TV that I saw this year, one of the most enjoyable viewing experiences that I had was watching Inside No 9 from the very beginning. Although it started in 2014, I confess that I had some serious catching up to do, having only ever watched the odd episode here and there. This is one of the benefits, and drawbacks, of an anthology series: every episode stands alone, so it is all too easy to dip in and out. When I finally committed, just in time for its last ever series, I realised that I had been missing out on a modern classic.Inside No 9: The Party’s Over commemorates its demise, after nine series and 10 years, with a behind-the-scenes documentary, mostly pulled together as those final episodes were filmed. Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith guide viewers through this modest victory lap, filming each other on their phones, digging out old photos of them sharing a flat in their 20s, looking through a scrapbook containing The League of Gentlemen clippings and reviews and notebooks with single lines scrawled in them that would go on to be shaped into some of Inside No 9’s most innovative instalments.

He attended the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama but left aged 20 to work for BBC Radio Wales. Jobs followed on regional TV, shopping channels and advert voiceovers, before his break at 35 with his one-man sitcom, Marion and Geoff, and Human Remains, a series with Julia Davis; both were produced by Steve Coogan’s production company, Baby Cow. Today, he mixes primetime gameshow presenting with acting, and reprises his role as Uncle Bryn on Christmas Day in BBC One’s Gavin &amp; Stacey: The Finale.Uncle Bryn, a role written for you by Ruth Jones and James Corden, is such a beloved character. Be honest: how much of you is in him?
 I think it’s probably quite a lot. But what I realised a while ago is that the best acting is when you see where you and the character meet – and I heard Al Pacino say this, so it must be right! Still, when Bryn is enthralled by something like technology, or when he’s a bit wide-eyed, I do wonder if that’s something they’ve directly observed in me.

The Guardian,I travelled up and down the UK this year. One album sums up what I saw | John Harris,"Weariness, confusion, flashes of anger – for me, English Teacher’s lyrics evoke the texture of British life todayThe most revelatory experience I had this year happened at Glastonbury, on the festival’s Saturday night. I was at the Left Field, the 1,500-capacity big top where the afternoons begin with panel discussions about politics, and the evenings are given over to music. The penultimate attraction of the day was a quartet from Leeds called English Teacher, who played for an hour, and took my breath away: not just because their music was brimming with ideas and creativity, but because it also seemed to perfectly crystallise the state of the country. As the performance went on, the crowd received it all with an increasing feeling of rapture; by the end, it felt like everyone had concluded that they were experiencing something very special indeed.Their first album, This Could Be Texas, came out in April. Its songs do not achieve their feats with rhetoric or sloganeering, nor have much to do with party politics: their subject matter is too kaleidoscopic to be reduced to simple social or political commentary, and like the best zeitgeist-capturing musicians, English Teacher deal in poetic, impressionistic, often wonderfully strange language. The words written, sung and spoken by the singer and lyricist Lily Fontaine sometimes suggest fragments of conversations you might hear at bus stops, or in pubs or cafes, full of a sense of life having been upturned, but human beings somehow muddling on: “Shoes were bought, broken in / One new pair breaks the bank … Can a river stop its banks from bursting? Blame the council, not the rain / No preparation for the breakdown … That country is in a bad state / There’s a familiar atmosphere about the place”.John Harris is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Sun, 22 Dec 2024 12:00:45 GMT",0.0,0.9678

The Guardian,My body is already in decline. Now experts can predict when my mind will follow | Emma Beddington,"What’s more depressing than the thought of a long, slow decline in health? The thought of several short, sharp declines. Thank you, science!I don’t believe ageing is linear: I reckon we have long plateaux, then everything falls apart all at once. I realised this at the close of my harrowing 31st year, when I looked in the mirror and didn’t recognise the sad, grey ghost staring back. I swear one day I was young and moderately dewy with a functioning musculoskeletal system; the next my face imploded, shortly followed by my knee (yes, it was a fun year). There’s a phrase for this kind of sudden ageing in French: prendre un coup de vieux, which feels appropriate, since I was living in France during that first precipitous decline and prolonged exposure to the angry rigours of Parisian life was at least partly to blame.Anyway, now science is catching up. Earlier this year, researchers identified two “peaks” for ageing at 44 and 60, and now a new paper points to three peaks in brain ageing.

The Guardian,"Farage, Musk and Candy say ‘cheese’ – now British democracy’s toast | Stewart Lee","Last week’s photo op with the Reform leader and X owner was further evidence of the UK’s inevitable march towards the far right. Merry Christmas!There’s a new photo of Nigel Farage and the Reform treasurer, Nick Candy, who partied through the pandemic at Lord Shaun “Bum and Boobs” Bailey of Paddington’s Pissedmas disco with a load of dancing Tory spads in horrible Christmas jumpers, meeting Elon Musk at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago document storage unit slash vanity art display mausoleum. How’s that for an opening para? It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. They think it’s all over. It is now.The last time Farage posed like this was eight years ago, with his fellow bad boys of Brexit and Trump himself at the same Trump Tower lift where Michael Gove contemporaneously observed “an immensely dignified African American operator”. But now Farage is finally standing next to the organ-grinder in charge of democracy’s hand-cranked dance of death, instead of the orange monkey whose jaunty capering distracts the punters while their passports are lifted and burned.Stewart Lee tours Stewart Lee vs the Man-Wulf next year, with a Royal Festival Hall run in July.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Ahmed al-Sharaa and HTS: seeking to rebuild Syria while branded as terrorists | Editorial,"The rebel group that toppled the Assad regime finds early success as it reinvents itself to gain international supportDiplomacy is often known as the art of making the impossible possible. If so, Ahmed al-Sharaa, Syria’s de facto leader, has proved a master of persuasion and compromise. Despite his Islamist faction, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), being blacklisted as a terrorist organisation by the US, UK, EU and UN, Mr Sharaa has welcomed their officials to Damascus. His “productive” talks with the US led to a $10m bounty on his head being lifted. To signal change, he has shed his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, and rebel fatigues to steer Syria away from 54 years of Assad rule.The visits signal an international desire to recalibrate in response to Syria’s shifting power dynamics. But whether they lead to concrete measures remains an open question. There is a pressing need to do something: more than 90% of the population is living below the poverty line. More than 6 million people have left the country and 7 million remain displaced within its borders. Mr Sharaa would like HTS to be taken off the terrorist list, recognition to be given to his caretaker government, and sanctions imposed during Bashar al-Assad’s reign lifted, so the country can be rebuilt.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on a 'community right to buy': unleashing the power of the local | Editorial,"After a decade and a half in which social infrastructure has been allowed to crumble, Labour is right to see bottom-up reform as part of the solutionIn his 2018 book The Social Edge, the prominent public health researcher and author Anthony Costello writes that social trust and the conditions that allow it to flourish are a neglected feature in studies of human progress. Small-scale “sympathy groups”, he suggests, through cooperating and organising together over shared concerns, can be the building blocks of collective wellbeing. Empowering local communities works.For years, politicians have rhetorically nodded to such thinking, while failing to provide the resources that would allow it to be translated into practice. Between 2010 and 2024, as a parade of Conservative ministers waxed lyrical on the virtues of localism, the governments they served presided over a bonfire of community assets on a shocking scale.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Waspi decision will lead to voters deserting Labour | Letters,"Readers respond to the recent announcement that the government won’t pay compensation to women affected by the rising pension ageI’m furious at the government’s decision to ignore the advice of the ombudsman and refusal to compensate Waspi women (Anger greets UK government decision not to compensate ‘Waspi women’, 17 December). What’s the point in having a lengthy and expensive review if you don’t pay it any heed? I along with many others have been waiting a long time to hear what our compensation would be, even though it would go nowhere near the £50,000 many of us lost. I&nbsp;didn’t imagine they would so easily dismiss our suffering as a result of government failure to give us time to plan. Labour has already removed the winter fuel allowance. One wonders what it will hit us with next.When you’re close to the edge of a precipice, every kick brings greater jeopardy. It’s almost as if they want pensioners to suffer, that we are their scapegoats. This is a last straw for me when it comes to Labour. I will never trust it with my vote again. I’d leave the country and go and live close to my daughter in New Zealand, but I can’t because the government then freezes your pension and you’re effectively worse off every year. I wrote to the pension minister about that, but it seems I’m not even important enough to warrant a reply. Maybe the government thinks we don’t matter because we’re not powerful, or that we’ll be gone before too long.

The Guardian,Ange Postecoglou’s unserious Spurs exposed by serious Liverpool | Jonathan Liew,"Spurs can win spectacularly and are fun but they could have had Arne Slot in 2023 and instead have the same pot of relaunched stasisLiverpool are serious about this. They’re not in London for souvenirs or sightseeing. They had a game four days earlier, they’ve got another in four days’ time, and so all they really want for Christmas is to get in, get the points and get out. They’d rather do it clean. But they’ll do it dirty if they have to.Above all, they know exactly what they want. Luis Díaz wants to spin off his man and run from deep, and Ryan Gravenberch wants to plug the gaps and get the ball moving, Dominik Szoboszlai wants you to commit, but not until he’s put you half a step off balance first, and Mo Salah wants to be Mo Salah. They can go short or long, hit you from every angle, hurt you from every bit of the pitch. Nine Liverpool players made a key pass in this game, including the goalkeeper and both full-backs.

The Guardian,Time for Tyson Fury to consider leaving the stage after Usyk defeat dims aura,"The Briton stayed the distance against Oleksandr Usyk but after back-to-back defeats what is left for the 36-year-old to prove?In the end everyone runs out of road. It was probably necessary for Tyson Fury to say he was robbed in the Kingdom Arena on Saturday night. Boxing demands this level of irrationality. Logical multimillionaires do not willingly schedule a brain-jarring, soul‑shredding half-hour beating from one of the most effective practitioners of controlled violence&nbsp;ever to walk the planet. A basic suspension of reason is required. Without it no one would ever step in the ring.So Fury will maintain that all three judges were wrong to award a unanimous points decision in Oleksandr Usyk’s favour after 12 thrillingly intense rounds in Riyadh. Last time out Fury said he lost because of the war in Ukraine. This time he said it was because of Christmas. Nobody was robbed here. Fury, the challenger, needed to go out and actively take the heavyweight belts. In the event the champion always seemed to have his head above the water.

The Chelsea head coach has insisted all along that his young side lack the experience and pedigree to sustain a title challenge with Liverpool.

She was sitting around the Olympic Village in Paris with her sprinting teammates – and she was bored. “I said to Yemi Mary John: ‘I’m gonna make this TikTok’,” Nielsen recalls. She took herself to her bedroom, got out the flip phone each athlete had been given and typed into an Excel spreadsheet: “Where you at? Holla at me.”Her five-second spoof of Kelly Rowland’s music-video texting fail took hardly longer than that to make. It also got 8m views. “It’s funny that the videos that do that best are the ones you don’t put any effort in,” says Nielsen with a laugh. She is still trying to make sense of the fact that her TikTok channel was the most popular of any British athlete at the Games, beating even the knit-tastic Tom Daley in second place. At the end of the Olympic fortnight her channels had been viewed by more than the Australian and German teams combined. Continue reading...","Sun, 22 Dec 2024 08:00:42 GMT",0.0,0.8569

This year, a bloody war between rival factions of Mexico’s notorious drug mafia has cast a shadow over the holiday, leaving Culiacán’s Christmas fair nearly empty, and the city silent at night.Sinaloa has always had a complex relationship with its narcos, who portray themselves as generous bandits with a code of conduct. But as the war enters a fourth month, with more than a thousand dead or disappeared, the myth of the good narco is wearing thin. Continue reading...","Sun, 22 Dec 2024 10:30:44 GMT",-0.872,-0.8945

The Guardian,Treasure Island review – dashing female pirates strike gold on high seas,"Orange Tree, Richmond Playwright Hannah Khalil weaves the real stories of buccaneering women into Stevenson’s classic adventure story, in a show filled with youthful verveWhen two women offer their services to a crew setting off for adventures at sea, young Jim Hawkins expresses his surprise. They have always been there, the women tell Jim, but just haven’t been well documented. Playwright Hannah Khalil is rectifying this in her retelling of Robert Louis Stevenson’s classic by combining his tale of buccaneers and buried gold with that of 19th-century female sailors – but without making it a jarring history lesson.It is structured as a relived memory for Jim, who is looking to the moment an old shipmate of Captain Flint enters his mother’s inn and dies. That death sets off the discovery of Flint’s map containing the location of hidden treasure, and the expedition to find it by a ragtag fleet of sailors. Among them is Long John Silver, the pirate disguised as a cook, and the two female sailors who scheme to mutiny and take control of the treasure.

The Guardian,Spend Spend Spend review – suitably gaudy but unsatisfying revival of 60s pools winner musical,"Royal Exchange, ManchesterJosh Seymour’s production of the 90s musical about Viv Nicholson’s big win, and how she spent it, leaves you feeling a bit short-changedJust like that, £152,000 goes up in (real) flames. Left unanswered, after this symbolic opening to the 1998 musical by Steve Brown and Justin Greene about 1961 football pools winner Viv Nicholson, is how someone could burn through today’s equivalent of more than £4m in less than five years.
 The story is narrated retrospectively by Viv (Rachel Leskovac), who watches her younger self, played by Rose Galbraith, scurry and flutter across the stage like a banknote in a breeze. That stage is a silver coin on cash-green carpet, over which tinsel fringes hang like confetti that never lands. The lustre of Grace Smart’s design suggests an illusory quality to Viv’s compulsive romanticism. Described as a “dream girl”, she views sex, for instance, not as “friggin’” but as “a beautiful memory… a dance of love”. Strings of dancers parade through, with Lucy Hind choreographing Charlestons and foxtrots that reinforce Viv’s surreal fantasy.
 Josh Seymour’s production is an appropriately gaudy fever dream, with blizzards of cash and Galbraith riding a champagne bottle like a rocket. Frivolity dominates; this play scrimps on pathos. Viv’s abusive father (a hammy Joe Alessi) and a series of violent husbands are treated clumsily, hands held aloft in freeze frame after striking her. The hardship of Viv’s mining community is kept to a single song, John Collier, which builds to a rousing chorus, the men’s voices resonating like heavy machinery.
 It amounts to a scant inquiry into the motivations behind the impulsivity that finds Viv pregnant at 16, married at 17, with four more husbands to come, and the spending sprees themselves. Leskovac contemplates all this, emotionally spent, letting out the words “Roll back the years” like a long sigh. She delivers the ballad Who’s Gonna Love Me?, lit harshly on the now bare stage, as if howling in an empty vault.At other times Viv is impassive, lacking ruefulness. At the end, Spend Spend Spend can muster only platitude (money isn’t everything). Not quite the jackpot, then.Spend Spend Spend is at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, until 11 January 2025 Continue reading...","Sun, 22 Dec 2024 11:30:44 GMT",0.7351,0.9783

It’s not simply that on this grey November lunchtime, the vent to our left is pumping frigid air into the room, as if they failed to notice the clocks went back weeks ago. It’s also the hard-lined space with the slab-like picture windows looking out on to St Swithin’s Lane. It’s the parquet and the bright lights, the hefty chairs upholstered in a frosty shade of cadet blue, and the desperate attempt to soften everything with a large fern imprint on a taupe wall. The tables are set just far enough apart so diners can plot against their rivals and mutter “your shout or mine” at each other without being overheard.

The Guardian,My husband left me last Christmas. How do I get closure? | Ask Philippa,"Give yourself permission to grieve, not just for the end of your marriage, but also for the man you thought you knewThe question Last Christmas, my husband left me. He’d been on a few festive nights out with work and I noticed a change in his behaviour. When I asked what was wrong, he told me that a conversation we’d had a couple of months previously, whereby I talked about divorce, had been playing on his mind. I didn’t want a divorce, but I was just trying to get him to see that I felt he was neglecting me with his obsession over losing weight (which he didn’t need to lose) and exercising. Before the exercise obsession started he was my best friend and supporter, so this was such a shock.He never grieved for his father – a very difficult man – who died earlier in the year. The day after he left he sent an email saying he couldn’t stop thinking of me talking about divorce and he wanted to separate. I was shattered by this. Where had it come from? No amount of apology from me had any affect. Continue reading...","Sun, 22 Dec 2024 06:00:37 GMT",0.0,-0.9522

On paper, it’s not hard to see why. It’s one of the world’s least corrupt countries, built on a democracy and quick to give women the vote. Education, from daycare to university, is free. Crime is low, the water is clean, the air fresh and there are more saunas than cars. But is it noticeably a nice place to be? And can the Finns teach me (and the rest of the UK, which ranks 20th in the Happiness Report) anything about wellbeing in the land of forests and freedom?I start in Helsinki. With a population of just 630,000, this is a pocket-sized, but delightful capital city, buzzing with a Nordic foodie scene, a clutch of tech startups and its own design aesthetic, all bathed in up to 19 hours a day of sunlight in the summer. Over coffee at Nolita, his zero-waste restaurant and bakery, Serbian-born chef Luca Basic tells me that he came to Helsinki aged 19 and immediately decided to stay. So, what’s happiness in the city?

The Guardian,Knowing the Christmas school fair is on? Not for all the reminders in the world | Seamas O'Reilly,"Some parents are good at noting the important events, others… at making up for it in the sweets raffleThe Christmas fair in my son’s school was, like all such things, unexpected. This is no one’s fault, but my own. I have a tendency to be – nay, an addiction to being – the last person to know about anything going on in his school. It is entirely my fault, you understand. There are leaflets and emails and reminders, it’s just that they never seem to sink in and leave me filling out zoo paperwork at 6am on the morning of ‘Adopt a Giraffe’ Day, or scrambling to cobble together a costume on Sunday night, before ‘Dress Like One of Those Chilean Miners That Got Trapped In 2010’ Week begins in earnest for another year.It’s tempting to say that I was blindsided by this Christmas fair, but sadly, such a claim does not stand up to scrutiny. For one thing, I have been reminded of it several times by people in our school WhatsApp group and my son has also mentioned it several times more than once. Neither of these measures, however, can beat the one other timely reminder I’ve had that this occasion was round the corner; the placard I agreed to have placed outside my house advertising said event since early November. I have walked past this placard every time I’ve entered or exited my own home every single day since, without once internalising that it was an actual event that was actually happening. Today.

The Guardian,Christmas shopping is rubbish. I found my best gift in the bin | Eva Wiseman,"Sometimes the perfect present is a timely reminder that, even when it absolutely seems like it, all is not lostI discovered the perfect Christmas present at work the other day after eating fish and chips too fast. I was wearing too many layers for the office, where heating is pumped from unusual angles bringing with it the smell of lasagne or sewer, and I was sweating. Partly, it was the layers, partly it was the meeting due in five minutes, which was about the future of our jobs, and I was in a rush to get a seat at our possible execution. By the sinks I removed a jumper and washed my hands, and joined my colleagues in a bright glass room. But, as the meeting began and my hands became fists, I realised something awful. I was missing a ring from my little finger. It was small and silver, in the shape of a tiny safety pin – I’d bought it 20 years ago on my first week at work and worn it every day since. Its loss struck me as ominous.I am largely anti-Christmas present. I write this as a person who has helped compile numerous magazine gift guides, blithely sticking a cashmere sock beside, perhaps, organic sausages containing the Tibetan goat they were sheared from, beside a coffee table book about fonts, beside a hairclip in the shape of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and, for the dads, a rake. The guides have come to open up for me a crack of dissatisfaction that creaks wider with every caviar cookbook, every feminist earmuff. I write this as a person, too, for whom shopping has come to feel like a treacherous bloodsport, a person who once took shelter in the Greggs concession upstairs at Primark and had to drop a pin so friends could organise a welfare check.

The Guardian,Best films of 2024 in the UK: No 1 – All of Us Strangers,"Andrew Haigh’s devastating metaphysical drama follows a lonely gay writer as he interacts with the ghosts of his parentsAndrew Scott on starring in All of StrangersThe best films of 2024 in the UKUnderneath the radical swoon of Andrew Haigh’s ground-shifting gay drama Weekend was a swell of sadness. Clearer in the film’s more universal right-people-wrong-time romance but also in the more specific, and knottier, queerness. It was a rare, giddy uplift to see young gay men fall headfirst for each other with such believable and unfettered intimacy but their affection existed in a world full of caveats – where to kiss, how to act, who to be – and it was only in privacy that they could really be themselves. “When I’m at home I’m absolutely fine,” Tom Cullen’s Russell says. “I’m happy being gay … It’s when I go outside …”Twelve years later in All of Us Strangers, Haigh’s first film about gay characters since, what lies outside has dramatically changed. Same-sex marriage has been legalised. Gay culture at large has been more widely embraced, from Heartstopper to Queer Eye to Drag Race. It has, allegedly, got better. But for Andrew Scott’s lonely gay writer, Adam, things remain troubled on the inside, a fix to the political not enough to mend the personal, living like Cullen’s Weekend protagonist before him, in a high-rise far away from everyone and everything else. This time it’s not just on the edge of a city but on the edge of the world, eerily close to that of another, on the precipice between the living and the dead.

The Guardian,The big picture: another Christmas rolls around…,"The most wonderful time of the year couldn’t be more manufactured in Al Barry’s amusing shot of Santa heads on a conveyer belt in 1955One solution to the vexed question of how old Saint Nick could fill every child’s Christmas stocking on a single night was provided by the Ideal Toy Corporation in 1955. In this picture by Getty photographer Al Barry, Santa was revealed as mass produced, ubiquitous. The image of the conveyor belt of Santa heads minus suits and boots and sacks might have invited the usual pearl-clutching about the commercialisation of Christmas – but which 1950s child would have wanted it any other way?Barry’s picture is included in a new collection of photographic festive nostalgia, A Very Vintage Christmas, which goes behind the scenes of winter wonderlands in the years between 1900 and 1980. As well as plastic Santa heads the collection includes images of the gigantic Macy’s Day parade Santa, of a battalion of chocolate Santas and of the famous Santa impersonator Lucky Squire, trimming his beard. Other traditions also excite economies of scale: there are production lines of novelty cracker twisters and cottage industries of bauble spanglers; warehouses of panettone processors, and Norfolk stately homes stuffed with turkeys. The joy of kitsch is set against the rawer emotions of the war years – sacks of mail stretching to the wintry horizon packed not with letters for Santa, but with missives to loved ones serving overseas – when Christmases “like the ones we used to know” were invested with collective hopes and dreams.

The Guardian,On a wing and a prayer: the hidden beauty of insect’s flight – in pictures,"For the past decade, the Barcelona-based visual artist Xavi Bou has devoted his work to revealing “the hidden beauty of natural movement”. His initial focus was birds; now he’s moved on to insects. In collaboration with US entomologist Adrian Smith he’s created an eye-popping series that captures – by merging multiple frames into a single image – the rhythmic flutterings of butterflies and chaotic leaps of spittlebugs and treehoppers. As well as their beauty, Bou was struck by the crucial role that insects play in ecosystems, even as their numbers plummet – it’s estimated that the biomass of flying insect species has decreased by 75% over the past 27 years. “We need to move beyond seeing insects as mere nuisances,” says Bou. “They are fascinating, essential creatures, and we owe them a great deal.” See more of Xavi Bou’s images here Continue reading...","Sat, 21 Dec 2024 17:00:22 GMT",0.5859,0.967
