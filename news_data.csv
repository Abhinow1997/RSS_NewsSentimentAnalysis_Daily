The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskyy rejects ‘quick win’ ceasefire sought by US,"‘We will not sign just anything in order to be applauded,’ Ukrainian president insists; European leaders pressed on sending troops to enforce peace. What we know on day 1,091  The US is trying to “please” Vladimir Putin as it aims for a “quick win” by rushing towards a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an interview broadcast on Monday. “The US is now saying things that are very favourable to Putin … because they want to please him. They want to meet quickly and have a quick win. But what they want – just a ceasefire – is not a win,” said Ukraine’s president, according to a translation provided by broadcaster ARD. “We [Ukraine] will not sign just anything in order to be applauded … the fate of our state for generations to come [is at stake].”Zelenskyy warned that Europe was in a weak position if it could not rely on US security assistance. While “readiness has increased” in recent years, “in terms of troop strength, the number of combat troops, the fleet, the air force, the drones … I honestly think that Europe is weak today”, he said. Zelenskyy said Ukraine had grown more resilient over the past three years and that “Putin wouldn’t be able to occupy us the way he wanted to”. Even so, he warned that “there will definitely not be a Ukrainian victory without US support”.Zelenskyy said he and Trump had spoken about deploying foreign troops to police a future ceasefire. “I told him the Americans should be a part of this, because otherwise we might lose our unity.” At a meeting of Kyiv’s backers in Brussels last week, Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, flatly rejected the possibility of a US troop deployment to Ukraine.Zelenskyy has hardened his language since the US announced one-on-one talks with Russia, excluding Ukraine and Europe. On Monday he said that Kyiv “did not know anything about” the talks in Saudi Arabia this week and “cannot recognise any things or any agreements about us without us. And we will not recognise such agreements”.Speaking after emergency talks between European leaders in Paris, the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, also warned the US against attempts to agree a “fast” ceasefire, which would give Russia the chance “to mobilise again, attack Ukraine or another country in Europe”. Russia was “threatening all Europe now”, she said. The war was about Russia’s “imperial dreams, about building a stronger and a bigger Russia, and I don’t think they’re going to stop in Ukraine”.After Keir Starmer, Britain’s prime minister, said he would consider putting troops in Ukraine to enforce a peace deal, the prime ministers of Sweden and the Netherlands indicated they would consider it if the peacekeeping force had a strong and clear mandate. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said Poland did not plan to do so. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said: “We in Germany are prepared to contribute soldiers to a security guarantee for Ukraine if necessary.” However, he was “irritated”, adding: “It is completely premature and completely the wrong time to have this discussion now ... I want to say that quite frankly, people are talking over Ukraine’s head, about the outcome of peace talks that have not taken place and to which Ukraine has not said yes.”Keith Kellogg, officially Donald Trump’s Ukraine envoy, on Monday denied that Washington would impose a peace deal “on an elected leader of a sovereign nation”, meaning Zelenskyy. Kellogg, however, does not appear to be involved in the Russia-US talks taking place in Saudi Arabia this week. Asked if the US would put a security guarantee behind other countries sending troops to enforce a ceasefire, Kellogg said: “I’ve been with President Trump, and the policy has always been: you take no options off the table. Before any type of discussion and security guarantees is finalised, of course those discussions are going to take place. Answers to those questions will be determined as you come up with the final process.” Continue reading...","Tue, 18 Feb 2025 01:44:09 GMT",-0.7964,0.9823
The Guardian,Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone review – these incredible children offer a sliver of hope,"This often-distressing BBC documentary follows astonishing kids working as TikTok chefs and hospital porters – and shows their determination to smile in the face of unimaginable horrorThe children of Gaza will be its future, if they are able to remain there. Starting several months into Israel’s bombardment and continuing right up until the recent ceasefire, London-based directors Jamie Roberts and Yousef Hammash made their documentary Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone by remotely instructing two local cameramen, Amjad Al Fayoumi and Ibrahim Abu Ishaiba, as they captured life inside the “safe zone” – an ever-changing, ever-dwindling area in the south-west of Gaza, designated by Israel as the place where displaced Palestinians should reside. That the cameras predominantly follow children has an unexpected double effect: it makes the film’s many deeply distressing moments all the more unbearable, yet it tinges them with some sort of hope.The kids are led by 13-year-old Abdullah, who acts as narrator as well as appearing on camera. “This area used to be colourful,” he says, briskly touring a scene of apocalyptic destruction in Khan Younis, where he lived in a house that sheltered 40 people before Israeli bombs turned it to dusty rubble. “Now, it’s grey.” Continue reading...","Mon, 17 Feb 2025 22:00:48 GMT",0.4404,-0.6997

The Guardian,What Marielle Knows review – teenager’s telepathic powers reveal parents’ secrets and lies,"In this fantasy-satire of bourgeois family life, a girl is suddenly able to see everything her messed-up parents are up toHere is a high-concept satire of bourgeois family life with all its secrets and lies from German film-maker Frédéric Hambalek; it is something to remind you of the notorious Babel fish in Douglas Adams’s The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, which you can put in your ear and then comprehend what any creature in the universe is saying — a miraculous promotion of pure understanding which has been the cause of more and bloodier wars than anything else.Marielle (Laeni Geiseler) is a moody and withdrawn teenager with messed-up parents. Her mum is Julia (Julia Jentsch, who 20 years ago memorably played anti-Nazi martyr Sophie Scholl) and dad is Tobias (Felix Kramer). Julia is on the verge of a furtive affair with work colleague Max (Mehmet Ateşçi) while Tobias is being turned into a beta-male joke at his publishing company – his cover design choice for a new novel is scorned by his underlings, and he’s particularly undermined by a supercilious smoothie called Sören (Moritz Treuenfels).

The Guardian,‘Serge Gainsbourg pretended to be an alcoholic’: Jean-Claude Vannier on making a masterpiece with the louche legend,"He has influenced everyone from Beck to De La Soul to Arctic Monkeys. As the great musical ‘disruptor’ unveils his new murder-and-mandolins epic, he looks back on his most famous collaborationAsk a set designer to create a bohemian Paris apartment and they’ll probably come up with something that looks a lot like Jean-Claude Vannier’s: books everywhere, vintage Bauhaus armchairs, art on every bit of wall space. You would say the living room was dominated by his grand piano, but your eye keeps getting drawn to a plethora of toy pianos that sit on and around it. On closer inspection, there are toy pianos on the shelves too, crammed among the books. “I’ve got more in the other rooms,” shrugs Vannier, speaking through an interpreter, “and I have a house in the country that’s full of them too. I take them to concerts and play a note or two. I find it adds something to a live performance that is filled with virtuosos. I have an open-tuned guitar that I kick, too – it makes a big boom.”Disrupting an orchestral performance by playing a toy piano or kicking a guitar seems characteristic: Vannier, now in his early 80s, has been a disruptive presence in French pop for 60 years. His latest project is pretty odd: a song cycle performed by a vast mandolin orchestra, accompanied by a story written by Vannier that involves a broken romance, alcoholism, homelessness and murder.

The Guardian,Intercepted review – phone taps are a chilling glimpse into Russian soldiers’ minds in Ukraine,"Recordings of fighters’ wiretapped phone calls are juxtaposed with images of wartime destruction in Oksana Karpovych’s compelling war documentaryVietnam saw the advent of the visible war, documented by TV cameras; but the Russia-Ukraine war perhaps represents the moment we also get a fully audible one. With two relatively affluent belligerents involved, mobile phone coverage is ubiquitous on both the civilian and soldier sides. Juxtaposing intercepted calls back home from frontline Russian troops with shots of the devastation they have wreaked in Ukraine, this film is a bleak and searing wiretap into Putin’s warping effect on his people and the psychology of power.“A Russian is not a Russian if they don’t steal something,” jokes one woman when she hears her brave boy has looted some makeup for her. Set against the shots of ransacked living rooms, wrecked petrol stations and dimly lit bomb shelters, such casual banter hammers home a chilling normalisation of imperialism and aggression – which comes with varying justifications. There is the standard dehumanisation: that the “khokhols” (a derogatory Russian term for Ukrainians) deserve it. Many parrot Putin’s line that the special military operation is fighting fascists. Or, in some troops’ amazement at Ukrainian ice-cream and abundant livestock, we glimpse an economic envy that lets such lies slip down more easily.

But after JD Vance met the far-right leader Alice Weidel in Germany, it is time to be clear about what we are seeingJD Vance’s decision, while in Germany, to meet the far-right AfD leader, Alice Weidel, yet decline a meeting with the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, would have caused more alarm, I feel, if it hadn’t come accompanied by so much other signalling. The vice-president of a nation engaged in tearing down its own institutions lectured the whole of Europe on its project to “destroy democracy”, which is absolutely textbook: he’s describing black as white, openly turning observable reality on its head. It’s unsettling, for sure, but that’s because it’s audacious, not because it’s complicated. It’s the simplest move of statecraft ever – show the world who you are, dare them to call you on it.Meeting Weidel was the second simplest move – show the world who your allies are, dare them to mention it, or see if instead they turn themselves in knots trying to bring the AfD back into the fold, rather than accept that the postwar consensus has folded.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Services are crumbling and overstretched, and a postcode lottery means women are often struggling to access treatment, with devastating consequences. The new Labour MP Laura Kyrke-Smith has been speaking movingly about the death by suicide of her friend Sophie, who ended her life 10 weeks after the birth of her third child. Sophie had been suffering from anxiety, especially around her baby’s feeding, and they had spent a night in A&amp;E, but it is unclear whether signs that she was at risk were picked up by professionals. Her friend has been left wondering if, amid all the worry about the baby, anyone asked her mother if she was OK, and what a difference that might have made not only to Sophie, but to the three young daughters she left behind.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author.

The Guardian,Trump’s plan for Gaza leaves Arab nations facing an impossible choice | Nesrine Malik,"This mortifying dilemma goes to the very soul of the region - and its leaders have brought it on themselvesArab states are in a bind. King Abdullah of Jordan squirmed in the Oval Office last week, as the press asked him and Donald Trump about the latter’s Gaza plan. He is in a tight spot, wanting to keep Trump onside while at the same time not agreeing to the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. Immediately after, anonymous Egyptian “security sources” – not parties prone to leaking without strategic direction from President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi – said that Sisi would not accept an invitation to visit Washington as long as the Gaza displacement plan was on the agenda. Now, this was probably more for the Egyptian public’s consumption than for Trump’s benefit – Egypt is in no position to make an enemy of the new administration – but it nonetheless shows how hard it is for Trump to secure the acquiescence of even the US’s closest allies.Saudi Arabia also postponed a visit to the US once Trump announced his intentions for Gaza. And in a remarkable change of tune, Saudi, which before 7 October 2023 was en route to normalisation with Israel and is not usually a country to make heated statements, lost its patience. When Benjamin Netanyahu quipped that maybe it would like to take Palestinians from Gaza (“they have a lot of territory”, he said), Saudi state media unleashed a storm of invective against him. When Trump announced his plan, Saudi Arabian authorities immediately put out a statement rejecting it. So keen was the government to signal that rejection that it released the statement at 4am local time. Continue reading...","Mon, 17 Feb 2025 06:00:29 GMT",0.0,-0.3181

The Guardian,"As the US retreats, Europe must look out for itself – so is Macron’s nuclear offer the answer? | Simon Tisdall","Development of a joint defence shield would be politically explosive for Keir Starmer. But it’s an idea whose time has comeThe startling contempt for Europe’s intensifying security concerns displayed by Donald Trump and his henchmen has brought an old, controversial question back to the fore: should Britain and France pool their nuclear weapons capabilities and create a Europe-wide defensive nuclear shield to deter Vladimir Putin’s Russia, if the US reduces or withdraws its support?Trump has not so far explicitly threatened to cut US nuclear forces based in Europe. But speaking last week, the president said he wanted to halve the US’s defence spending, especially on nuclear weapons. Trump often denigrates Nato, keystone of European security. Last year, he encouraged Russia “to do whatever the hell they want” to member states that, in his view, spend too little on defence. Continue reading...","Mon, 17 Feb 2025 07:00:30 GMT",0.0,-0.9548

The Guardian,"The Guardian view on the US, China and the rest: Trump is opening doors for Xi | Editorial","The US president’s bullying of allies and partners is short-termist and will boost Beijing’s power, not Washington’sDonald Trump’s return to the White House is so far proving more nightmarish for US allies and friends than adversaries. China certainly doesn’t relish a trade war with the US, but it was better prepared than others for Mr Trump’s tariffs, and both sides appear to be leaving room for a potential deal. And, though China’s leader, Xi Jinping, is poised for worse to come, the second Trump term is bringing Beijing opportunities as&nbsp;well as problems.International respect for the US plummeted under his last administration. As the US president turns the screws on long-term partners, China is looking to take advantage. Colombia quickly caved to Mr&nbsp;Trump on the matter of migrant returns, but China’s ambassador&nbsp;has been celebrating the “best moment” in&nbsp;relations between Bogotá and Beijing. Under pressure from the Trump administration, Panama announced that it would allow its participation in China’s global infrastructure plan, the belt and road initiative (BRI), to expire. Yet behind-the-scenes arm-twisting had already begun tilting Panama back towards the US. Mr&nbsp;Trump’s attempts to humiliate and bully may backfire there and across the region.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Last week there was a&nbsp;strikingly different session, as four care-experienced young people offered their perspectives to the education committee. The point was to increase MPs’ insight by confronting them with children for whom social care is a hugely important fact of life.Some of the material shared was personal. But these witnesses also had opinions about how services could be changed to better meet the needs of young people in similar positions. As well as describing losses and disappointments, they spoke warmly about adults who&nbsp;had supported them. This included teachers, personal advisers (support workers for care leavers up&nbsp;to age 25) and foster carers.

Their Sunday defeat at Tottenham was an engaging if bitty affair that finished 1-0 largely because the low quality of defending on show was compensated for by the low level of attacking. It was fun in its way, but it didn’t feel a lot like Premier League football.It also meant United dropped to 15th in the table, having won just four of 14 league games under Ruben Amorim. Under Erik ten Hag this season, United were taking 1.22 points per game; under Amorim that’s down to 1.00.

The storm weakened into a tropical low by Saturday, but continued to cause widespread flooding, particularly near the Pilbara rivers and the Great Sandy Desert.Zelia intensified rapidly because of the record-warm Indian Ocean temperatures, which were 1-2C above the seasonal average, providing increased energy and moisture to fuel the storm. While Port Hedland in Western Australia had minimal damage, nearby areas like Pilbara and Marble Bar faced flooding and fallen trees. The Great Northern Highway remains closed, disrupting food supplies and leaving supermarket shelves empty. The tropical low is now tracking southwards, with rainfall becoming patchier and lighter.

The Guardian,‘It was like she was possessed’: how Q Lazzarus made Silence of the Lambs’ most bewitching song – and then vanished,"Her track Goodbye Horses soundtracked one of the 90s thriller’s most memorable scenes, but the singer ended up driving cabs and dying in obscurity. Now a new documentary lets her tell her storyIn August 2019, the New York film-maker Eva Aridjis Fuentes embarked on a cab ride that would change her life. Though her driver sported sunglasses and a turban, Aridjis Fuentes thought she looked eerily familiar. “The&nbsp;driver played Neil Young’s Harvest album in its entirety; we sang Heart of Gold together. I asked if she’d ever seen Neil play. She said: ‘Oh no, my concert days are long over’. So then I asked if she’d ever seen Q Lazzarus.”Q Lazzarus was the stage name of Diane Luckey, a singer from the 80s whose song Goodbye Horses had soundtracked Buffalo Bill’s infamous nipple-tweaking scene in The Silence of the Lambs. The track became a cult classic, covered by Bloc Party’s Kele Okereke, Deftones’ Chino Moreno and MGMT among others. Q vanished in the mid-90s, with many, including friends and collaborators, believing she was dead. But Aridjis Fuentes – who regularly played Goodbye Horses at club nights – had a hunch that Luckey herself was driving this taxicab. “She looked in the rearview, said, ‘Oh, I’ve heard of her’, but abruptly changed the subject,” Aridjis Fuentes remembers. Later, though, the driver admitted: “I’m Q.” Continue reading...","Mon, 17 Feb 2025 10:00:31 GMT",0.3612,0.9313
The Guardian,Why Nickel Boys should win the best picture Oscar,"In the first of our annual Oscar hustings, here why RaMell Ross’s incredibly tender film of Colson Whitehead’s novel should take the top prizeThe idea of praising a film for being beautiful is understandably suspect. It’s the kind of gushing tribute paid to things that turn out to be lifeless and humourless. But RaMell Ross’s Oscar-nominated film Nickel Boys, adapted from the novel by Colson Whitehead, really is beautiful; it creates beauty and even a kind of complex, defiant joy from generational pain and trauma caused by racism in the postwar United States. Of all the films on this mixed best picture nomination list, Nickel Boys – produced by Dede Gardner, Joslyn Barnes and Jeremy Kleiner– is the film which I’d most like to win, perhaps partly because as a film about the African American experience it for some reason isn’t in the conversation in the way Barry Jenkins’s Moonlight once was.Gorgeously shot by Jomo Fray and designed by Nora Mendis, the film follows the fortunes of Elwood, played by Ethan Herisse, a smart young black boy in 1960s Tallahassee, Florida, who gets thrown into a brutal reform school called The Nickel Academy (based on the notorious real-life Dozier School). This is a racist tyranny where the black kids are beaten and often killed, in which case they are secretly buried and officially described as “runaways” – and all because Elwood innocently hitched a ride in a stolen car on his way to a technical academy for which he had been recommended on account of his academic promise. A nauseous irony re-routes him to a different institution. Continue reading...","Mon, 17 Feb 2025 11:03:15 GMT",0.8402,0.9498

 A teenager narrates this absolutely vital film about what life has been like for young people in Gaza since 7 October 2023. Abdullah, 13, is incisive, quick on his feet and at times alarmingly indifferent as he shows the horrors around him. We also meet cooking TikToker Renad, 10, who stops whisking when a bomb hits nearby: “We’re not afraid, we’re used to it.” And Zakaria, 11, who dreams of being a paramedic, is determined to “find a way to fit in” by helping casualties; it is a relief to see him enjoy a moment in the sea. Most haunting still, following news of Donald Trump’s intentions for Gaza, are Renad’s words after the ceasefire is announced: “If Gaza goes back to how it was before, I’ll stay for sure.” Hollie Richardson Continue reading...","Mon, 17 Feb 2025 06:20:27 GMT",0.296,0.4215
The Guardian,Girls on Wire review – Chinese behind-the-scenes stunt drama is a spectacle,"A stunt double who plays roof-bouncing ninjas before the lead steps in for the closeup is stuck in a family/mob triangle in Vivian Qu’s occasionally silly thrillerVivian Qu is the Chinese film-maker who has directed three features and also produced the noir drama Black Coal, Thin Ice which in 2014 won Berlin’s Golden Bear. Now she brings this crime melodrama to Berlin, an engaging if tonally uncertain high-wire adventure that satirises China’s hopeless addiction to gangster capitalism. It is also acidly unsentimental about the bread-and-circuses escapism of the country’s booming film and TV industry with all its period-costume wuxia nostalgia. It’s an appealing film, though it contains some strangely broad comedy and is also, in a couple of violent moments, a bit naive about exactly how easy it is for a young woman physically to fight off a big strong guy.Above all, Qu gives us a rather amazing set-piece scene on the set of a wire-fu action movie, a scene that feels real in a way that the rest of the film really doesn’t, for all that it is watchable. Fang Di (Wen Qi) is a tough woman employed as a stunt double on a movie set, playing the black clad, sword-wielding ninja bouncing over terracotta rooftops and whizzing through the air in long shot. For the closeup, the preening star in the same outfit steps in while Fang Di staggers over to get a coffee at the craft table. The work is exhausting and dangerous and Fang Di is doing it to pay off her family debts to mob matriarch Madame Wang. Continue reading...","Mon, 17 Feb 2025 14:30:38 GMT",0.0,-0.6271
The Guardian,"‘Dying changes you. I’m more understanding now’: Ian Smith on cancer, celebrity – and 40 years on Neighbours","As the show’s beloved star Harold Bishop, Smith has seen actors from Margot Robbie to Guy Pearce come and go. Offscreen, he has battled grief, finding out he was adopted in his 50s and now a terminal diagnosis. Here, he reflects on a remarkable lifeFor a man who was supposed to be dead next month, Ian Smith looks good. Astoundingly good: huge smile, glowing skin, that famous wobbly chin. There is only one visible clue that he has terminal cancer: a freshly shaved head, over which he frequently rubs his hand. Chemotherapy left him with “an awful half shaggy, half bald look”, so he buzzed it all off. “First time I’ve been bald since I was a baby,” he says, happily. “Apart from no hair, you can’t tell I’m sick at all.”Smith is among Australia’s most recognisable actors, although you may not know him by his name. Charlie Brooker once described him as “probably the friendliest face on television – a cross between 10 Toytown mayors and a baby”. Perhaps you know him as Harold Bishop from Neighbours. Smith joined the cast in 1987, two years after the show launched, and became one of its longest-serving members, appearing in more than 2,100 episodes over five decades.

A wetsuit may seem the obvious choice for winter swimming, but many open-water wetsuits won’t offer much warmth in water below 10C, and the effort of putting one on at this time of year when swims are short often isn’t worth it (see more detail below).

He laughed, noting that those words in relation to recipes made him both curious and, because of their foggy closeness to mythologising, suspicious.It was his recipe for hazelnut ragu that started it all, sending us down more or less the same paths in books and online, where we met more of the same thing: fabulously contradictory stories in which ragu made from hazelnuts was an ancient Piedmontese dish of great beauty born out of economy and hardship, and also “forgotten”, which justifies the lack of any evidence as to where it actually came from. Yet also, a breezy, contemporary dish that, like so many modern dishes, was scorned by those faithful to more traditional (ancient, authentic) versions. There were other claims, too, such as “This is the authentic recipe” and “This is an improvisational dish: do as you wish”. In short, a big tangle, which makes for entertaining reading. Although maybe not for those of the opinion that recipe writers should stop the self-indulgent introductions and get straight to the recipe – which is what we did.

The Guardian,Falling for Alassio – the rebirth of an Italian resort,"The former fishing village on the Ligurian coast was once a favourite with the wealthy British set. Now instead of tennis and tea parties, it offers scenic treks and seafood feasts in glorious spring sunshine‘Why don’t the inglesi come here any more?” The question was asked by a customer at Caffè Roma in the seaside town of Alassio, whose pre-second world war British population could reach 5,000.There are several reasons, I think. From the late 19th century, wealthy Britons would arrive in October to escape the winter cold, stay until May, and then head home before the torrid Italian summer. These days, British people with that kind of wealth probably winter between Zermatt and the Caribbean. But neither has Alassio great appeal to more ordinary Britons wanting a summer holiday: August temperatures can hit the high 30s, crowds and prices surge and, as in so many Italian resorts, the sands are taken over by beach concessions from&nbsp;Easter to September.
