The Guardian,Patience review – this clunky depiction of autism just isn’t good enough,"A preposterous plot and terrible dialogue make for a deeply uninspired detective drama. Its nuance-free take on neurodivergence is embarrassingly clunkyWelcome to your first odd-couple detective drama of 2025. Patience is an adaptation by Matt Baker (Hotel Portofino, Before We Die) of Franco-Belgian creation Astrid et Raphaëlle. It’s about the evolving partnership between a young autistic cataloguer of police evidence (here named Patience and played by Ella Maisy Purvis), and dedicated older detective Bea Metcalf (Laura Fraser), who pulls her out of her comfort zone after recognising that Patience’s secret talents as a criminologist are being wasted in the bowels of the archive. She adds the unwilling young woman to her investigative team after Patience links the DCI’s current case – a man with apparently everything to live for, who self-immolates after withdrawing £8,000 from the bank and dropping it in a car park bin – with others that were dismissed as suicides but actually make no sense as such.Off they trot, uncovering an increasingly preposterous plot involving the suggestibility-inducing drug scopolamine, a jittery hotel maid, a sex addict, a missing sister, a sceptical boss who says things such as “Spare me the intuition” when brought several mountains of circumstantial evidence, plus cigars left at all the crime scenes. One hopes that in real life it wouldn’t have taken the introduction of a preternaturally talented pattern-spotter to see that this might be a link between the deaths, but I gather policing is fairly dismal across the board these days, so who knows. After a new victim, a telling matchbook from a hotel and two very drawn-out episodes, we eventually get resolution. Continue reading...","Wed, 08 Jan 2025 22:00:44 GMT",0.4404,-0.91
The Guardian,Replaying games from my past with my young children has been surreal – and transformative,"Introducing my kids to games like Link’s Awakening has given me a whole new perspective on these old favourites and made me excited for what new video game adventures we’ll have together in the futureThanks to some distinctly Scottish weather over the holidays, my family and I ended up celebrating Hogmanay at home rather than at the party we’d planned to attend. My smallest son’s wee pal and his parents came over for dinner, and when the smaller members of our group started to spiral out of control around 9pm, we threw them a little midnight countdown party in Animal Crossing.The last time I played Animal Crossing was in the depths of lockdown. Tending my island paradise helped me cope while largely imprisoned in a 2.5 bedroom basement flat with a baby, a toddler and a teenager. (I was far from the only one – the National Videogame Museum compiled an archive of people’s Animal Crossing experiences during the Covid-19 pandemic, and it’s evident that it was a lifeline for many.) Our guests had brought their family Switch, and we set up the kids with their little avatars so they could join the animals’ New Year party.

The Guardian,Simon Schama’s Story of Us review – not a good look for an Oxbridge professor,"This cultural history of the British people is a vague, subjective take that lurches into the reactionary when it tackles social media. It’s a far cry from being a ‘major’ seriesSimon Schama’s new show is, the BBC press blurb says, a “major” series, and it bears a grand and sweeping title, the Story of Us. One always wonders to whom such weighty first-person plurals refer – the answer here is the British people, in terms of how our postwar arts and culture have shaped who we are. But the picture of us is subjective, somewhat vague and limited to just three episodes. Major series are not what they used to be.The timeline begins with the first cultural event Schama himself can remember, the 1951 Festival of Britain. It presented the country as forward-looking and dynamic, but the techno wonderland it set up on London’s South Bank was a temporary installation that the incoming Conservative government were happy to demolish – and, behind the dream of a bright manufacturing future, workers were on the rough end of Britain’s class divide.Simon Schama’s Story of Us aired on BBC Two and is available on iPlayer.

The Guardian,More fizzle than pop: the limits of Nicole Kidman’s erotic drama Babygirl,"Despite bold scenes for mainstream American cinema, the sexy dom/sub age-gap film can’t quite figure out what it’s saying about desireArguably the most transgressive scene in Babygirl, A24’s erotic drama from the Dutch writer and director Halina Reijn that has Nicole Kidman on the awards circuit, is the first one. The film opens with an orgasm – for both Romy Mathis (Kidman) and her husband, Jacob (Antonio Banderas), together, in the marital bed. But as Jacob slumbers in post-coital bliss, Romy scampers down the hall – the shot of Kidman’s bare, apple-cheeked behind recalls her first scene in Stanley Kubrick’s 1999 film Eyes Wide Shut, one of several erotic 90s touchstones Reijn seeks to invoke and invert through the female gaze. In another room, we witness a private ritual. Her hands desperately flutter across a laptop keyboard; she prostrates herself on the ground, and makes herself come – for real this time – to porn.It’s a bold opening salvo for a film, a statement of sorts: this film, arriving amid Hollywood’s long slide toward sexlessness, is not about sex so much as female desire. In less than two minutes, we glimpse a tangle of lust, shame, inner chaos, deception, actualization – what Romy sounds like when she’s faking it and when she’s not. For her, as for many women, desire is a maze, bent by societal pressures and warped by internalized incuriosity, non-linear, combustible and not fully comprehensible.

The cold war, which would last more than four decades, was only just beginning. It was hard to see six months, let alone six years ahead.But Bevin did not sit waiting for the fog to clear.

The Guardian,The spiralling cost of borrowing spells trouble for Rachel Reeves – but she must hold her nerve | Jonathan Portes,"There is no need to panic: the government’s overall fiscal strategy is the right one. Spending cuts would be a mistakeThe cost of UK government borrowing is higher than it has been since just before the global financial crisis of 2008. The yield on five-year gilts – the interest rate the government is paying on the £4.25bn it borrowed today to finance the deficit – is about 4.5%, nearly five times what it was a decade ago, and higher than at any time during the Liz Truss meltdown.So have the so-called bond vigilantes come after Rachel Reeves, selling off their holdings of government bonds en masse as they did after Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng’s budget? Not really. The Truss debacle was the consequence of a toxic cocktail of irresponsible tax cuts, institutional vandalism and a near-death spiral in an obscure part of the pensions market, all of which were UK-specific. By contrast, since the start of 2023, UK long-term interest rates have broadly followed US ones upwards. While part of this reflects the fact that UK inflation has been somewhat more persistent than the Bank of England hoped, it is mostly driven by global developments, and especially those in the US, where growth and inflation are somewhat higher than expected. It’s this, far more than anything the new UK government has done, that has driven the rise in borrowing costs.Jonathan Portes is professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London and a former senior civil servant Continue reading...","Wed, 08 Jan 2025 16:53:33 GMT",-0.2144,-0.8126

No wonder I don’t have any advice of my own to pass onWhat’s the best bit of advice you’ve ever had? It’s a common question to lob in at the end of an interview. I mean the kind of interview you might be doing to promote a book or a film or something, rather than an interview for a job. Although I suppose it might crop up there too. I wouldn’t know, as I believe the last interview I had of that kind was for a job at the Birmingham Post in 1992. Not quite sure how I’ve managed to swerve all that stress ever since.When I’ve asked the question of someone, on the radio, the interviewee has invariably been stuck for an answer. Now I see why. I’ve been asked it several times in recent months, at literary festivals and whatnot, talking about a book of these columns. In the absence of a prepared answer, it’s difficult to come up with anything interesting in reply. And preparation has never been my strong point, even though I’m well aware of its importance, thanks in part to all the sage advice available on the subject: “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail” (Benjamin Franklin); “Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity” (Seneca); “Success depends upon previous preparation, and without such preparation there is sure to be failure” (Confucius); “Chance favours the prepared mind” (Louis Pasteur).

The boss of the regulatory body that ultimately decides which companies can list their shares in London added: “What’s important is that they disclose it, the investors understand it and they can price that risk.”Rathi’s remarks were inevitably read as aimed at Shein, the Chinese-founded but Singapore-headquartered fast-fashion retailer whose possible listing in London has been a running story since the company filed preliminary paperwork seven months ago.

Flexibility, agility and autonomy have become buzz words in an employment marketplace saturated with an endless choice of job opportunities.But the reality for most workers, especially younger ones who have recently joined the job market, is that jobs vanish as quickly as they appear, benefits are slashed, exploitation is rife and career paths once paved with middle-class respectability have crumbled under the relentless march of automation and the ubiquity of the platform economy.Oli Mould is professor in human geography at Royal Holloway, University of London Continue reading...","Wed, 08 Jan 2025 12:00:31 GMT",0.7003,0.5859
The Guardian,The Guardian view on content moderation: Meta did far too little. Now it wants to do even less | Editorial,"Loosening already limited safeguards on social media platforms is not just damaging. It could ultimately prove deadlyMark Zuckerberg famously boasted that Facebook had a saying: “Move fast and break things”. His product has not just destroyed industry models but also social mores and expectations of the reliability of information and, in the global south, has upended people’s lives. The technology writer Kara Swisher described him as “not just a technologist; he’s a social engineer”.Meta’s Tuesday announcement shows that it still moves at speed. Having previously been pressured into insufficient improvements in moderation, it is abruptly scrapping factcheckers on platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, starting in the US, and loosening other content restrictions. This purportedly addresses overreach by moderators. Other controls remain. But the signal is clear. Its new guidelines will allow users to call others mentally ill on the basis of their sexuality or gender identity. Meta will also “recommend more political content based on ... personalized signals” – which sounds a lot like buttressing echo chambers.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This is the perennial problem for opposition parties – how to persuade voters of your fitness to govern without access to levers of power. It is a challenge that is defeating Kemi Badenoch.The Conservative leader has said little of substance. Her stances, so far, are all reactive gestures. She has committed to reversing some of Labour’s tax-and-spend decisions.

The Guardian,"The care taskforce needs boldness, not buzzwords | Letters","Wes Streeting is wrong to frame social care as a burden on the NHS , writes Dr Melanie Henwood. Plus letters from Dr Marion Witton and Mike Smith.  The announcement of a new commission on social care has been met with an audible sigh from commentators, family carers and people needing care and support (Ministers plan biggest shake-up of adult social care in England for decades, 3 January). We’ve all been here before, built up expectations of reform and dared to hope things would change, only to face disappointment through the inaction of successive governments. There is little to inspire confidence that this time will be different. But could it be?The appointment of Louise Casey to chair the commission is to be welcomed – she has a track record of cutting through the weeds and delivering unequivocal conclusions and recommendations. But it’s a massive challenge given the repeated failures of past commissions and policy endeavour. The timetable for the commission is confused and poorly communicated – an interim report within a year and a final report in three is simply too long and suggests a lack of political urgency.

The Guardian,Latin can lay down skills that last a lifetime | Letters,"For Prof Lesley Smith, learning Latin made more sense than learning French. Liz Byrne encourages other teachers to consider learning and teaching itAs someone who learned Latin at a bog-standard comprehensive in Sunderland, it was both cheering and depressing to read of Arlene Holmes-Henderson’s work to keep classics in the classroom (‘They see it is living’: Durham professor’s mission to get more pupils into classics, 2 January). My school was lucky in its classics teachers precisely because Durham produced such good graduates who could stay and work in the area.In the north-east, we were surrounded by the Romans, and learning Latin made more sense to me than learning French, where the chance to use the language beyond the classroom seemed much less likely than for Latin. But learning French (and every language I’ve attempted since) was benefited by the understanding of grammar that Latin instilled. I went on to use my Latin professionally, so it also gave me a career and a future – but even if it had not, the mental discipline and inherent interest involved in learning Latin laid down skills that have lasted a lifetime.Prof Lesley SmithOxford Continue reading...","Wed, 08 Jan 2025 17:46:11 GMT",0.0,0.8481

Stephens prides herself on her integrity and, having contested hundreds of practice matches over the years, she says she always veers on the side of caution when charged with calling her own lines. Only when she is certain there is a clear gap between the ball and line does she call an opponent’s shot out.Halfway through the set, Stephens believed her opponent had missed a second serve and called a double fault. “She thought I cheated her in the practice,” says Stephens, smiling. “I didn’t know this happened [during] the practice.

It takes a mere two hours to drive around it, giving views of its rugged limestone cliffs and occasional sandy coves. These coves give way to caves and chasms, once used for storage, burial sites and even as living spaces. But perhaps what visitors seek most are its crystal clear waters, home to spinner dolphins, eels, grey reef sharks, sea snakes and humpback whales.Now the island is engaged in an innovative plan to try to conserve these vast and pristine territorial waters. The scheme, which has been running for a year, involves selling off sponsorship of the ocean surrounding the island to individuals or companies for NZ$250 (£116) a square kilometre.

The Guardian,How to go vegan: our beginner’s guide to everything from essential supplements to meat alternatives,"What you need to buy to make sure your new year resolution of following a plant-based diet lasts beyond JanuaryWhether you’re doing it for the animals, your health or environmental reasons, there’s never been a better time to go vegan. There’s meatless meat, dairy-free cheese, plant-based liqueurs and, well, anything else you can think of.With more than a decade of veganism under my belt, I’ve tried pretty much every plant-based brand going. I was a full-blown omnivore until the age of 20 though, so I can tell straight away when a new vegan product hasn’t got it right. Below, I cover the must-buy alternatives, from cheese to meat, to the foods that would-be vegans fear they’d miss the most. I’ll also tell you what not to buy. Worried about what supplements you need to take? I spoke to a dietician to find out. Continue reading...","Fri, 03 Jan 2025 16:00:24 GMT",0.0,0.4909
The Guardian,From stolen babies to dog murder: the TV shows that went way too far,"ITV’s controversial child-swap thriller Playing Nice has proved too triggering for some viewers. But it’s the tip of the iceberg when it comes to television crossing a lineWith controversial ITV baby swap drama Playing Nice, it’s becoming increasingly clear that your mileage will vary depending on your stomach for its premise. It revolves around a pair of children who were mistakenly swapped at birth, and the agony the subsequent discovery puts their parents through. It taps into a primal, gut-wrenching fear so profound that I know a lot of people – all parents, it must be said – who won’t even consider watching it.I have to confess that I’m enjoying Playing Nice, especially the gleeful way it becomes quite self-consciously barmy. But for many others it is a step too far. Even the show’s star, Niamh Algar, acknowledged this in an interview with the Times last week: “Any parent who is going to watch this is going to be terrified.” For many, a baby swap is a line in the sand, and that’s final.

The Guardian,Maria review – Angelina Jolie’s Callas commands the screen as a great diva in decline,"Pablo Larraín’s strange and mordant drama portrays Callas’s haughty struggle as her voice begins to fail but her stardom remains undimmedAngelina Jolie declaims an imperious performance as opera star Maria Callas in this strange, sad, mordantly witty film from screenwriter Steven Knight and director Pablo Larraín, showing her declining months in Paris in 1977; the lioness in winter succumbing with ecstatic defiance to illness and loneliness. Maria broods over her “medication” and neglects to eat, and she is impossibly difficult with the servants, housekeeper Bruna (Alba Rohrwacher) and valet Ferruccio (Pierfrancesco Favino), who are the aghast witnesses to her decline – and she is beginning to relinquish the idea that she will ever sing again. The whole thing is interspersed with pharma-fuelled hallucination-flashbacks to the days of her celebrity pomp, but also further back to her traumatised girlhood in Nazi-occupied Greece.This film has had a mixed, sometimes frosty reception; I can only say I found Jolie’s performance as luxurious as state-of-the-art fake fur, and there is an overt theatricality and artificiality which gives the film its life. Jolie’s own singing is digitally fused with lip-synced overdubs of Callas’s own recordings, while her non-singing performance is gorgeously haughty and self-aware, her eyes pathetically magnified to frog-like dimensions by the big glasses she wears for stalking about Paris, both demanding and resenting fan recognition. Her lips are always pursed in a very amusing moue of discontent, always about to deliver a curt putdown. And that voice – a theatrical refinement of the way Callas spoke in English, removing the American trace, but substituting an Anglicised nasal twang like a very subtle Katharine Hepburn with a hint of … yes … Gloria Swanson.

The Guardian,"Shoplifters, scams and supersoft toys: how the Jellycat craze inspired a crime wave","With the booming resale market for Jellycat rarities, retailers across the UK are reporting a surge in ‘stealing to sell’ shoplifting, with some going to extreme lengths to protect their ‘Jellies’The Jellycat section of Scotsdales in Great Shelford is 216 cubic feet of sensory overload. The brightly coloured, charmingly quirky toys fill floor-to-ceiling shelves in this Cambridgeshire garden centre, plastic eyes staring, stitched smiles beaming. There are plushly soft teddies and bunnies and cows and giraffes, but also boiled eggs in sunglasses and tennis balls with arms. Side by side they sit, a strange, soft communion, begging to be picked up and cuddled.A closer look, though, reveals something less alluring. Every Jellycat has a grey security tag dangling from it, a pin piercing its downy fur. A scan of the ceiling shows security cameras trained on the shelves. When a member of staff walks past, I notice them glance apprehensively at me – and, I realise, at my tote bag over my shoulder. A laminated sign next to the shelves confirms I am, indeed, under surveillance: “CCTV cameras are operating in this area.” Continue reading...","Wed, 08 Jan 2025 06:52:54 GMT",-0.6908,0.8881
The Guardian,Questions to ask yourself ... to improve your friendships,"Guardian advice columnist Annalisa Barbieri on strengthening bonds with the people who matter to usWe’ve all left a social occasion with someone feeling buoyed, or utterly deflated and angry. You can either blame yourself or the other person, but it’s often a combination of the two - or something you each bring out in the other. You can only take responsibility for your own behaviour, so look at your own responses; are you snippy? Do you answer back? Should you? It’s not that you shouldn’t retaliate, but you do need to see your place in things. If a relationship makes you feel better about yourself, cherish it and do the same for them. If not, think about why you’re still there. Continue reading...","Wed, 08 Jan 2025 07:00:03 GMT",0.6705,0.8024

The Guardian,A moment that changed me: I went to Kew Gardens – and found a place of safety after homelessness and drug addiction,"I’d had a very tough few years after my father died, living on the streets and sleeping with one eye open. But as I looked at a tulip tree that day, my love of gardening came flooding backI spent the early 00s living in my family home in west London, caring for my elderly father. When he died, in February 2015, I lost my home. When you’re on the streets, you have to sleep with one eye open in case people try to steal your things, so you end up being on alert 24 hours a day. The effect of living like that means you often look for distraction and I soon began spending time with other homeless people who were drinking and using drugs. I started smoking crack and heroin, and drinking heavily. My days all began to look the same: trying to stay warm, get into shelters, eat and score the next fix.When Covid hit in early 2020, things became really hard – people were getting ill on the street and it felt sometimes as if we had been abandoned. Eventually, I was relocated to a hotel room in Putney during the lockdowns and while I was there I started working with a housing charity, who got me a flat in Mortlake, Richmond upon Thames. By September 2021, I was finally off the streets and I knew that meant I also had to get clean, otherwise my place would become a crack den.

The Guardian,The man making a business out of China’s burnout generation,"Li Jianxiong was a highflying marketing executive in Beijing until a breakdown sent him to the west on a wellness voyage of discovery – just as his peers were losing faith in the Chinese DreamLi Jianxiong is convinced he has lived two lives. His first began in 1984, when he was born to impoverished farmers in China’s Henan province. Ambitious and daring, he took full advantage of the new economic reality that unfolded after the cataclysms of the Mao years. By 2017, he had secured a family, a house in Beijing and a reputation as one of China’s most talented young marketing men. His success, however, came at a cost. By then, China had become notorious for its “996” work culture – 9am to 9pm, six days a week – but Li was working something closer to 007: 24 hours a day, every day. While managing an all-consuming media crisis for his employer, a major tutoring company, he developed insomnia, heart palpitations and a severe rash that doctors attributed to a flagging immune system. He wondered more than once whether he might actually work himself to death.In Li’s telling, his second life began in 2018, when he left his lucrative job. Feeling broken and beleaguered, he treated himself as an experiment in self-rescue. He dabbled in Freud, read around in positive psychology, and familiarised himself with the writings of the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh. He absorbed biographies of Gandhi and Mother Teresa. He travelled to sacred Taoist sites in Hubei, an ecological healing village in Guizhou, a Buddhist charity house headquartered in Taiwan. He even moved to the US for a time, where he attended Christian self-development retreats and studied religion at Columbia University. Continue reading...","Tue, 07 Jan 2025 05:00:54 GMT",0.0,0.8806

It reflects the fact that Moore has often been recognised for everything except her acting: her beauty, body, dress sense, salary, box office and love life. All of which makes her rehabilitation and recognition truly satisfying. In her acceptance speech, she spoke of having been branded a “popcorn actress” by a producer 30 years ago – commercially successful but unworthy of acclaim.
