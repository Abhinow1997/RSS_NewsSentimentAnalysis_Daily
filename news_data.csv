The Guardian,Unforgotten review – like being trapped in a newspaper comments section,"This beloved cold-case drama still has a dry sense of humour, but its attempt to wade into the culture wars was not a good idea. Its tackling of politics is starting to feel very ham-fistedFor five series, Unforgotten was my go-to comfort television. Yes, the crime drama is always about a grisly murder, and every season begins with the gruesome discovery of remains that have been buried for years or even decades. And yes, there are plenty of scenes with body parts laid out on mortuary tables, being picked over by pathologists who say things such as, “this artery does show signs of gaping”, as if they’ve just won the lottery. But in its combination of strong casts, ample twists and the inevitable dispensation of justice, it always felt soothing, somehow. It is occasionally workmanlike, but reliably solid.As it reaches its sixth season, though, I worry that the wheels are coming off. The structure is largely the same every time – another reason it is so comforting, perhaps – and this seems to be no different. A body is discovered, it turns out to be a cold case, so it reaches the desks of the friendly, efficient and only mildly troubled cops we know and love. It throws a handful of suspects into the air and dares you to guess how these people could possibly be connected, then it waits for them to come crashing down to earth, as the pieces finally slot into place. It sprinkles it all with a touch of concern for the private lives of the detectives, and kicks back in nice, fancy kitchens as it works out whodunnit and why.

The Guardian,Big Boys series three review – sitcoms don’t get more moving than this,"From jokes about Tesco meal deals to depictions of life’s most precious moments, Jack Rooke’s semi-fictionalisation of his student years is back for the final time. It’s a beautiful, heartbreaking watchThe last episode of Big Boys finished on a note of almost transcendent devastation. From the very beginning, this tale of male bonding and sexual expedition – inspired by the comedian Jack Rooke’s university days – existed in the shadow of grief. The first thing we learn about Jack, our semi-fictional protagonist, is that his dad, Laurie, died when Jack was a teenager. Loss hovered over the show’s chronicle of the sensitive, sheltered Jack’s student scrapes, as he formed an unlikely friendship with his laddish, socially assured roommate Danny while struggling to find his feet in Brent uni’s gay scene.Yet it wasn’t until the final instalment of series two that we were thrown headlong into Jack’s grief. When his motormouth cousin Shannon goes into labour with her first child, the family are transported, physically and psychologically, back to the place where Laurie died. By intercutting the farcical birth scene – inappropriate midwives, urgent demands for Peperami Firesticks&nbsp;– with gut-wrenching flashbacks to Laurie’s final days, Big Boys was able to do what it does best: splice ferocious sadness with snippets of sweet, mildly profane comic relief, and capture life at its most precious and prosaic.

But for leading film and TV publicity and awards strategist Julie La’Bassiere, it made complete sense. Julie is British-born but moved to the US with her mother when she was a child and had been based there ever since. That was, until 2021, when she found herself living through a particularly ugly point in American history. “Between the Covid lockdowns, George Floyd and Trump, it was… a lot. I realised it was time to come home.”Julie did consider other areas of London, but kept finding herself drawn back to the neighbourhood where she lived until the age of eight, which was where her grandparents had settled when they came to London as part of the Windrush generation in the 1960s. “My grandparents were incredibly special to me and I have many warm memories of being looked after by them when my mother was at work,” she remembers. When Julie was collected from school by her grandfather, a bonus was that he drove an old Bentley. “It must have been in the year of the Queen’s Silver Jubilee, 1977, because I took to sitting on the back seat and giving my classmates what I called my ‘royal wave’…” Continue reading...","Sun, 09 Feb 2025 15:00:03 GMT",0.5719,0.9393

As a lead officer on arms sales policy, I was responsible for assessing whether the UK government’s arms sales adhered to legal and ethical standards under domestic and international law.In August 2024, I resigned over the UK government’s refusal to halt arms sales to Israel amid the bombardment of Gaza. This decision followed over a year of internal lobbying and whistleblowing.

The Guardian,Starmer’s dislike of real politics is plain to see. It’s why his government has no direction | John Harris,"In power, Labour’s agenda has been stripped back to an empty obsession with  growth and an imitation of Reform UK. The public isn’t falling for it“Keir doesn’t engage in the political process. He got this far by not expressing any political opinions … He’s good with people, but he doesn’t debate big ideas.”After 200 pages of a compelling new book about the Labour party’s return to power, the story falls into a run of these quotations. Get In, by the Westminster journalists Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogrund, makes it clear that after he became the Labour leader, Keir Starmer developed an incredible ruthlessness. Casting him as the kind of operator who ought to be renowned for the trail of human wreckage they leave in their wake, the book highlights the “many people whose careers have come to a brutal end at Starmer’s remorseless hand”. His readiness to behave like that, however, does not come from any ideological zeal, but rather its opposite: an absence of convictions and ideals that means he can shape-shift – and dispatch colleagues and allies – with a blithe ease.

They shouldn’t be socially shamed into undressing around them, or being in spaces where male colleagues get undressed in front of them.There is a host of principles and evidence around women’s privacy, dignity and safety to be marshalled in support of this – the charity Sex Matters lays them out – but most people don’t need to read accounts of how uncomfortable mixed-sex changing facilities make some women feel, or statistics showing that voyeurism and exposure are two of the most common male sex crimes, to understand how wrong this would be.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"You may not like Trump, but his power grab for the economic levers is right. Liberals, take note! | Leah Downey","The US president has recognised something that is rarely acknowledged: monetary policy is political. The question is how to make it democraticIf I asked you to list the things that make democratic politics meaningful, what would you include? Most likely elections and education. Perhaps the NHS, or the armed forces, or the justice system. I’m guessing that interest rates didn’t come to mind, which is strange, because they’re crucial to democracy. Last week, Donald Trump reignited a debate about who should be in charge of the monetary system that controls a country’s interest rates. You may disagree with Trump on a lot of things, but he’s not wrong to recognise that monetary policy – a subject that can seem dull and horribly technical – is fundamentally political, and tells us a lot about democracy.Interest rates shape everything. They influence whether you can buy a house, and how many houses get built. They affect which businesses expand, what new technologies emerge, and which towns thrive or flounder. In the 1990s, central bankers hailed the “great moderation”, a period of low and stable prices dominated by central bank independence. Then came the financial crisis, the eurozone crisis, and then the pandemic. The giant bailouts that followed these events were often described as “unconventional”. But perhaps they simply uncovered a fact that was always there – that monetary policy is not as apolitical as some would like people to believe.Leah Downey is a junior research fellow at St John’s College Cambridge and the author of Our Money Continue reading...","Sun, 09 Feb 2025 12:00:50 GMT",-0.2136,-0.8594

But maybe there’s more to life than being in a coupleSorry, Valentine’s Day is cancelled: we’re in a relationship recession. Analysis of demographic data by the Financial Times shows a dramatic decline in married or cohabiting young adults, with tanking “relationship formation” rates in countries as diverse as Thailand, Finland, Peru, South Korea and Turkey. In the US, the marriage rate fell by 54% between 1900 and 2022, while younger people aren’t even dating: the percentage of 16- to 18-year-olds who report having dated has dipped under 50%, the Atlantic reports, “with the decline particularly steep in the past few years”.My immediate thought is: well, obviously.

Ministers should go back to basicsFor anyone involved in the government’s strategy to combat violence against women, the National Audit Office’s recent report must have felt like a bucket of cold water. This is a societal problem that plenty of evidence suggests is getting worse rather than better – though inconsistent data is itself a challenge and makes firm conclusions tricky.The prevalence of sexual assault against women in England and Wales is estimated to have risen from 3.4% of the population to 4.3% between 2009‑10 and 2023‑24. Over the same period the number of reported&nbsp;rapes and sexual assaults rose around fourfold – a change only partly explained by improved recording. Violence against women and girls now accounts for about 20% of all crime, despite an estimated reduction in the prevalence of domestic violence (from 9.2% to 7.4%). Digital technology has&nbsp;created opportunities for&nbsp;new kinds of offending –&nbsp;and left lawmakers struggling to keep up.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on interest rates: the Bank of England on its own won’t revive growth | Editorial,"Base rate cuts may ease borrowing costs but without stronger public spending and targeted tax relief, economic stagnation will persist “It will be welcome news to many that we have been able to cut interest rates again,” said Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, last week. Plenty of mortgage holders would agree. Savers might not share Mr Bailey’s sentiments. However, he justified the cut, made despite inflationary risks, by arguing that falling worker bargaining power would see price pressures subside. Without rate cuts, the Bank warned, there was&nbsp;the risk of anaemic economic growth.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, backed the Bank, saying its action would “ease cost of living pressures”. That is true, but the benefits of lowering the burden of borrowing won’t outweigh the costs of Ms Reeves’ fiscal choices.

The Guardian,Class politics still plays a role in entrenching inequality | Letters,"Readers respond to an editorial on the politics of class and culture warsIn your editorial (The Guardian view on class politics: it has faded as culture wars have risen, 5 February), you wrote about politicians who “treat class as a matter of culture rather than economics, about tastes and traditions rather than where you sit in relation to power”. I&nbsp;suspect the reality is the other way round, that it is not your culture which defines your class, but your class (however imperfect and shifting the definition may be) that defines your culture, or at least some aspects of it.When we encounter institutional racism, misogyny, Islamophobia and so on in the police or the armed forces, we should ask whether those views were created in people by the organisation’s culture, or was the culture created by people who already had those views when they joined. If there is a problem with such prejudices being common in the class from which rank-and-file members of those organisations are predominantly drawn, we must recognise that and address it there, or we will never mend the organisations. If someone joining the police at 18 is a&nbsp;racist, it’s already too late.Mike PerryIckenham, London Continue reading...","Sun, 09 Feb 2025 17:32:35 GMT",0.25,-0.9153

The reigning champions recorded an 11th straight victory over Scotland to top the table with two bonus-point wins, pleasingly poised for a third successive title.There had been a sense of triumph in the way Hoy, diagnosed with terminal cancer last year, strode on to the pitch for an emotional pre-match ovation.

The Guardian,"Vibes, viscerality and the odd boo: inaugural Rose International prize is a curious snapshot of dance right now","Christos Papadopoulos took the award for his glacially paced, illusory Larsen C, beating a shortlist that largely eschewed traditional formal techniques and structures• The Rose International shortlist in picturesThe winner of the inaugural Rose International prize was announced on Saturday night. The new biennial competition with a £40,000 bounty for the victor is initially guaranteed to run for 10 editions, by which time it hopes to be on a par with the Booker or Turner prizes, boosting dance’s profile accordingly. It was Greek choreographer Christos Papadopoulos who took home the honour (and a cool Es Devlin-designed trophy) for his piece Larsen C, chosen by an eclectic judging panel, with Christopher Bannerman and Arlene Phillips from the dance world, musician PJ Harvey and poet Karthika Naïr. (There was also £15,000 awarded to an early-career choreographer in the Bloom prize, won by Stav Struz Boutrous.)Papadopoulos is pretty much unknown in the UK, but a darling of the Greek dance scene who’s toured widely in Europe. Larsen C may have been the most divisive piece in the contest. The title refers to an Antarctic ice shelf, and the dance does indeed move at glacial pace, with small, repetitive movements that drove some viewers to distraction (it’s rare to hear a “boo” in a polite dance theatre). It was inspired, the choreographer has said, by how your perception of something can completely alter when the smallest element is changed. There’s an element of illusion that can’t help call to mind Papadopoulos’s compatriot Dimitris Papaioannou, as bodies disappear into the blackness of the stage and flashes of flesh appear, looking like truncated arms or extra limbs – the dancers’ feet in shadow making them seem as if they’re gliding soundlessly. There’s beautiful movement here, boneless limbs like drifting tentacles, as mysterious as the creatures in the depths of the Mariana Trench.

The Guardian,We Do Not Part by Han Kang review – a harrowing journey into South Korea’s bloody history,"The Nobel prize-winner’s strange and unsettling new novel takes its protagonist on a mission that ends up confronting terrible pre-war violenceWhen Han Kang published her International Booker-winning The Vegetarian (2015), translated by Deborah Smith, about a South Korean housewife who gives up meat and wants to become a tree, the novel slotted into a wave of English-language fiction about female appetites and male control. But the books that came next were harder to pin down. After Human Acts, about the 1980 massacre of student protesters in Han’s native Gwangju, came The White Book, in which a Han-like novelist reflects on the death of her baby sister while musing on wartime Warsaw. Then came 2023’s Greek Lessons, riddling to the point of opacity, about a divorced poet’s inability to communicate.We Do Not Part, Han’s first novel to be translated since winning the Nobel prize for literature last year, has elements of all these books. Stark as well as ethereal, chronologically discontinuous, full of nested narratives – often structured as remembered conversations about remembered conversations – it exhumes historical horror but also swerves into hallucinatory magic realism without breaking the plausibly autofictional frame with which it begins.

Similarly, the sugar content varied between 9% of your recommended daily allowance to 13%, so if that’s a concern, look out for reduced- or no-sugar brands instead.There’s a significant price difference between supermarket own labels and the leading brands, too. If you’re after a gourmet experience, I’d recommend the Bold Bean Co’s rich tomato baked beans (£3.50), because they remind me of those homemade beans you sometimes get with a fry-up at fancy cafes: intensely savoury and packed full of herbs. They don’t qualify here, because they are to ordinary baked beans what rye sourdough is to white sliced, but they’re bloody lovely all the same. That said, you can’t go wrong with any of our best buys served on buttered toast with a light dusting of grated cheddar. Small pleasures don’t come much cheaper.

The Guardian,The best Valentine’s Day gifts: 34 thoughtful ideas they’ll actually want,"Forget hot-housed roses and generic chocolates: from a modern mix tape to a padel racket, give them something more considered this yearNot everyone embraces Valentine’s Day. It is, at worst, a commercial free-for-all crammed with out-of-season roses and overpriced, throwaway gifts and, at best, a day that sees you dashing to a supermarket at 6pm trying to find something that doesn’t scream “after-thought”.But if you are going to embrace it, there are some great, thoughtful gifts out there. We’ve put together a list of more unusual, long-lasting ideas: from Lego flowers to a digital mix tape, a refurbished games console to an affordable fragrance. Whether you’re looking for a present to bring you closer as a couple – half-and-half duvet, anyone? – or to attract someone new, our guide will help you ace Valentine’s Day this year.

But they’re right. The older I get, the more I know it. When I was 20, I could sleep anywhere: a friend’s floor, a filthy sofa – even a phone box one night. These days I won’t get a single one of 40 winks if I’m not lying on a decent mattress. Comfy but firm, cosy but breathable, and with loads of cool spots for my feet.Today’s best mattresses promise all this and more. Gone are the days when your biggest decision was between a sprung double or a sprung king size. Pocket springs are still around, but they face stiff – well, medium firm – competition from hybrid mattresses that combine springs and memory foam to provide that all-important balance of comfort and support.Best overall mattress:

The Guardian,Flat whites or long blacks? What our changing coffee tastes say about us,"From a 13th-century Yemen brew to the latest full-on blast of beans, the quest for the perfect caffeine hit continuesWhen a man called Jacob opened what’s thought to be the first British coffee house in Oxford in 1650, he cannot possibly have known what he was starting. Then, as now, coffee was fashionable. In France, which had beaten Britain in the race to bring the drink to western Europe, people were dazzled by the Turkish ambassador’s parties, at which he once served Isaac D’Israeli, father of Benjamin, “the choicest Mocha coffee in tiny cups of egg-shell porcelain”. Perhaps Jacob hoped this glamour would rub off on the Angel Coaching Inn (admission: one penny).But coffee was then still a quite basic thing: fragrant, maybe, but incredibly bitter. It was a matter of one size fits all (and absolutely no caramel syrup). The only faux pas a person could commit in its vicinity was to grimace too vigorously on tasting it, a gaucherie grand ladies were able quickly to conceal with the careful deployment of their fans.

It says things like “comfy”, “social” and “vibe dining”. I looked up the last one. Apparently, it means the place is, y’know, nice. We can all get behind nice.

The Great Indian is owned by Aman Dhir who already has a takeaway of the same name in Hackney where they serve chicken tikka, seekh kebabs, aloo gobi and the rest.

Recently, I had to isolate for health reasons and (as was the case during the lockdowns), being apart revealed the relief and peace I felt without her presence. My mum was sympathetic about my illness, but she made out it affected her more than it did me, my partner and child.Since childhood, I’ve been her emotional carer, hoping she might one day support me. Therapy helped me see I need boundaries, but attempts to set them were met with resistance, manipulation or dismissal. Her struggles with mental health and past trauma are undeniable, but they’ve left me feeling burdened, unsupported and resentful. I love her, yet I feel trapped in cycles of guilt and anger.

The Guardian,"Nigel Slater’s recipes for aubergines with tomato and yoghurt, and rhubarb, honey and sweet crumbs","Spiced aubergine and sweet rhubarb are two superb warming delicacies of the winter seasonI have made many a dinner from a good rummage in the fridge. This time, a couple of less-than-perfect aubergines and a paper bag of tomatoes were turned into a thoroughly satisfying stew, the aubergines fried separately, then added to a turmeric and cumin-scented sauce. The spicing was mild, just warming enough for a nippy winter’s evening, and a last-minute stirring-in of yoghurt and spoonful of crème fraîche brought a silky, almost luxurious note to my fridge-find. A shot of lime at the end made our supper sing.When I think about it, there is almost always an aubergine or two in the fridge. Like butternut squash, I buy them without having a plan. They are as much a part of a culinary squirrel-store as having a jar of beans and a packet of pasta in the cupboard.

Now he’s turned his focus closer to home. He opens up  about his adventurous childhood and what animals have taught him about living wellGordon Buchanan is what’s called a super- recogniser. That means the 52-year-old wildlife presenter and cameraman from Scotland has a near-unfathomable recall of faces he has seen only fleetingly. In tests at the University of Greenwich, he has memorised thousands of humans after only having looked at them once. Buchanan also scored well on chimp faces, but drew a blank with pugs. “What I learned from that particular study is that pugs really do all look the same,” he notes drily.For the most part this isn’t an especially useful – or monetisable – skill. The day before we meet, he was walking down Byres Road in Glasgow’s West End with his wife, Wendy, when he noticed two people who looked familiar. “That’s the couple who are in the Airbnb,” he told Wendy, referring to the property they rent out at the back of their house.

The Guardian,Can we break the anxiety habit?,"Writer and therapist Owen O’Kane believes we have become addicted to feeling anxious. Here, he explains how he learned to manage his fearsKey work events make me anxious. They give me chest pain, a churning stomach and disrupted sleep; my thoughts run through all the mistakes I could make and replay every bad experience in my past. Why put myself through this, I reason, which inevitably means that when, say, a high-stakes meeting is on the horizon, those feelings are worse, more intense, more prolonged. It’s a vicious cycle and one I admit early on when interviewing the anxiety expert Owen O’Kane.O’Kane doesn’t seem surprised and why should he be? I bet everyone tells him about their anxiety. My dread, avoidance and catastrophising interior monologue are bog-standard these days: research by the Mental Health Foundation in 2023 found that 60% of UK adults reported experiencing “anxiety that interfered with their daily lives in the past two weeks”. We’re anxious about global geopolitics, the climate and the cost of living; our health, jobs, relationships and what strangers think of us. It takes children out of school and adults out of work. It’s an uneasy background thrum everywhere, something I have assumed to be a product of our ill-adapted, threat-seeking brains being constantly confronted with every terrible thing in the world through the shiny rectangles clutched in our sweaty hands (US psychologist and author Jonathan Haidt recently characterised a whole demographic of smartphone natives as “the anxious generation”).

The Guardian,Going bald in an increasingly hairy world – podcast,"With the rise of hair transplants, many men are opting out of baldness. But why is it so hard to accept this natural part of ageing? Stuart Heritage and Rudi Zygadlo explainOnce, Stuart Heritage’s head was covered in thick, golden, shiny hair. But then, when he was in his early 20s, he noticed a small patch of scalp showing through. At first he tried a hair regrowth treatment, but it didn’t make much difference. As this patch grew, he began brushing his hair over the bald area. Before he knew it, he says, he was horrified to find he was sporting a combover. “Going bald is horrible,” he says ruefully.Once you have accepted this loss, however, and that it means you are ageing, actually “being bald is fine”. And not just fine – commonplace. He tells Helen Pidd that about 55% of Caucasian men aged over 75 will have experienced some hair loss. Which is why bald heads used to be ubiquitous in popular culture. There were bald footballers, bald movie stars and bald prime ministers. Yet today they seem to be fading from view.

The Guardian,"The big picture: wedding celebrations in London’s Banglatown, 1991","Wayne Tippetts’s shot of young Bangladeshi women preparing for a Gaye Holud ceremony is part of a series exploring a pivotal moment in the  neighbourhood’s historyWayne Tippetts took this picture in what became known as Banglatown – the area between Brick Lane and Whitechapel High Street east of the City of London – in 1991. Tippetts was, he recalls, in the habit at the time of walking up from near the river at Wapping where his photo agency, Select, had its offices, and taking pictures of the Bangladeshi community, families who had mostly arrived in London in the 1970s. Tippetts’s pictures have now become a monograph that captures a pivotal moment in the history of that ever-changing part of London, when second-generation Bangladeshis were starting to assert their cultural identity, and to feel fully at home.In this image, the photographer recalls, “young Bangladeshi women, known as ‘sakhis’, friends of the bride, had gathered outside her home on a council estate in Tower Hamlets”. The women were preparing to shower other guests from the balcony with yellow and red flower petals and sweets during the Gaye Holud ceremony, a pre-wedding tradition. Though embracing the customs of their parents, Tippetts notes, the young people he met, including these young women, were at that time balancing that heritage with “multicultural influences of fashion, music, and youth subcultures that were flourishing in the city at the time”.Wayne Tippetts – Banglatown, London 1991 is published by Café Royal Books (£6.70) Continue reading...","Sun, 09 Feb 2025 07:00:42 GMT",0.0,0.743
The Guardian,Where the heart is: the artist memorialising homes lost in the LA fires – in pictures,"On 10 January, as fires raged across Los Angeles, local portrait artist Asher Bingham made an offer via an Instagram reel: “ To anyone that has lost a home in the #LAfires I will draw [it] for free.” She had already drawn the house of a close friend that had burned down; by offering her services more widely, she hoped to help others grieve for what they’d lost. She wasn’t prepared for the response. So many people sent in photos – 1,300 and counting – that she had to recruit volunteers to keep up with demand. For Bingham, it’s all about the small details: wind chimes, potted plants. “Anywhere I can see people put love into their home, I draw it,” she says. “I’m trying to recreate a memory that only lives in their minds of the beautiful time they lived there.”See more on instagram.com/asherbingham.fineart Continue reading...","Sat, 08 Feb 2025 17:00:26 GMT",0.4404,0.8428

The Guardian,"Matt Goss looks back: ‘I’d like another Bros experience. Something massive, Bros on steroids. Bigger, the biggest’","The singer on his estrangement from his brother, his Vegas residency, and finally feeling comfortable in his own skinBorn in London in 1968, Matt Goss was a member of Bros, the 80s pop group formed with his twin brother, Luke, and friend Craig Logan. The&nbsp;trio had hits including When Will I&nbsp;Be Famous? and I Owe You Nothing, before splitting in 1992. Matt went on&nbsp;to have a solo career, and recently concluded one of the longest residencies by a British artist in Vegas history. Bros reunited in 2017, coinciding with the Bafta-winning documentary Bros: After the&nbsp;Screaming Stops, which followed the fraught relationship between the twins, who are currently estranged. Matt will take his solo show on tour throughout March and April.This was taken in our biker jacket phase. I’m wearing one by Rebel Rockers of London and I’m happy I&nbsp;still&nbsp;fit into it; after turning 50 I could have been Fat Goss rather than Matt Goss. Was I happy about how I looked? I have always been confident about what’s inside my heart, less so my appearance, so I don’t think I felt great here. While I participated in certain aesthetic travesties over the years, the&nbsp;classic Bros look – the denim mixed with the jacket, the T-shirt and&nbsp;Dr Martens – is something that still feels relevant. As for the hair – I&nbsp;used Dax. Super greasy and thick. It&nbsp;was not kind on the scalp, but it looked fucking good. Continue reading...","Sat, 08 Feb 2025 12:00:21 GMT",0.3612,0.9363
