The Guardian,"Pope Francis remains in stable condition, a day after respiratory crisis","Pontiff, 88, spends long periods off noninvasive ventilation, showing improving lung function as he battles pneumoniaPope Francis remains in stable condition a day after a respiratory crisis, and has spent long periods off the noninvasive ventilation he initially needed, in a sign that his lung function was improving as he battles double pneumonia.
 Francis had no further episodes of bronchial spasms, the Vatican said in its late update on Saturday. He had no fever and no signs of new infection, was feeding himself and continued his respiratory physiotherapy, the Vatican said.
 The 88-year-old pope had a good response in his blood gas levels even during the “long periods” he was off the ventilator mask and only using high-flow supplemental oxygen. But his prognosis remained guarded, meaning he was not out of danger.
 “The Holy Father is always vigilant” and aware of what was going on around him, the statement said, adding that he received the Eucharist and spent time in prayer.
 The comparatively positive update came after Francis suffered a setback on Friday in his two-week battle against pneumonia.
 Francis had a coughing fit in which he also inhaled vomit. Doctors aspirated the vomit and placed Francis on noninvasive mechanical ventilation, a mask that pumps oxygen into his lungs. Doctors said episode resulted in a “sudden worsening of the respiratory picture”.
 The pope remained conscious and alert at all times and cooperated with the manoeuvres to help him recover.
 The fact that Francis on Saturday was able to use just high-flow oxygen for long periods, without any significant effect on the levels of oxygen in his blood, was a sign his respiratory function was improving.
 The pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has lung disease and was admitted to Gemelli after a bout of bronchitis worsened and turned into pneumonia in both lungs.The Vatican said the episode was different from the prolonged respiratory crisis on 22 February that was said to have caused Francis discomfort. Doctors not involved in Francis’s care said it was particularly alarming given his existing lung disease and fragility.
 Types of noninvasive ventilation include a BiPAP machine, which helps people breathe by pushing air into their lungs. Doctors will often try such a machine for a while to see if the patient’s blood gas levels improve so they can go back to using oxygen alone. Friday’s statement said Francis showed a “good response” to the gas exchange using the mechanical ventilation.
 Doctors did not resume referring to Francis being in “critical condition”, which has been absent from their statements for four days now. But they said he was not out of danger, given the complexity of his case. Continue reading...","Sat, 01 Mar 2025 19:22:03 GMT",-0.4404,-0.4144

This group also had the lowest proportion of people who thought their partner was “definitely” in love with them – just 25.31% – and the lowest proportion having sex, at 82.72%.Moderate: About four in 10 – 40.91% – landed in this category, which Bode described as “fairly stock-standard” – or in the words of the journal article, “entirely unremarkable”. Those in this category were more likely to be male, and less likely to have children. This group had “relatively low intensity, relatively low obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and relatively moderate frequency of sex”.Intense: This category described about one in three – 29.42% – of survey respondents, who Bode described as “crazy in-love” types. They were characterised by “the highest intensity, highest obsessive thinking, highest commitment, and relatively high frequency of sex”. About six in 10 people in this group were female.Libidinous: About one in 10 – 9.64% – were libidinous romantic lovers, who had sex an average of 10 times a week and up to 20 times. They were characterised as “relatively high intensity, relatively high obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and exceptionally high frequency of sex”. This group were slightly more likely to be male, and had the highest proportion of people in a committed relationship but not living together.

The Guardian,Wild swimming gave me the courage to write my own rules,"Out of his depth and determined to defy stereotypes, one writer discovered his sense of self in a bracing cold dipGrowing up, I learned not to trust water. I was a poor swimmer and splashing in the sea on holiday always had a hard edge to it. The second my toes left the sandy floor I panicked, for fear of being swept away.Things changed a few years ago at a friend’s birthday weekend in Cornwall. One February morning, a dozen of us took a hungover walk to the beach. It was overcast and blustery, and we had come to skinny-dip. I was buoyed up by the camaraderie and games of the night before, and felt a safety in numbers. People stripped off, actions hastened by the wind, and before I could think, I followed. We ran over sand and pebbles and dived into the oncoming waves. It was a total sensory overload. Salt filled my nose and mouth. I heard shrieks and cursing, and so much laughter. As I emerged there was a surge of adrenaline, and I couldn’t stop giggling. It was scary, but I was also proud, like a child who’s climbed a really big tree. Afterwards my skin tingled and as we shared a flask of tea, I felt singularly happy. Continue reading...","Sat, 01 Mar 2025 18:00:46 GMT",0.4939,0.7992

But she also remembers becoming hyperfixated on one friend, then another and another in succession. She tended to be impulsive and, wanting to please others, easily led. One distressing incident in particular has never left her. On the first day after moving to a new school, she was relieved to be taken under the wing of two girls. At lunchtime, in fits of giggles, the girls egged each other on to do naughty things. Anna spat orange juice at the boys. She did it with relish, only to reproach herself later. She feels the episode coloured her whole school experience.As a child and an adult, Anna felt sanctioned, judged and misunderstood. She considers herself a chameleon who adapts to new environments and survives by being funny, but all too often regrets things she has said. Her self-esteem is low.

Various other operators come and go in William Friedkin’s gritty and unsettling procedural – based on a real heroin sting – before Hackman’s Detective Jimmy “Popeye” Doyle emerges from behind an ill-fitting undercover Santa Claus outfit, like a background player busting into his first lead role. It’s as fitting an entrance as ever for Hackman, leveling up after his supporting work on TV and films like Bonnie and Clyde. And he gives a performance that sets the tone for his whole career, playing the brutal and racist cop, a morally murky figure who just doesn’t sit right as the hero of the story. Many of the qualities that made Hackman so great in later villainous roles – the way he moves like a menace with a devilishly charming grin, slipping so easily from comforting to antagonizing – are in Doyle. That detective’s infamous query, repeatedly grilling suspects about picking their feet in Poughkeepsie, is as mischievously disorienting as Hackman’s onscreen presence.

The Guardian,"No pain, all gain: how to get stronger and build more muscle","Hitting the gym will make you fitter and happier, but not all strength work is equal. Here are the smart choices to make – with weights and without – for all ages Gym culture is changing. Once the preserve of musclemen whose veins looked ready to pop, now muscle-strengthening activities are being advised by the NHS for those aged 19-64 at least twice a week. That’s because an increasing body of evidence links strength work with wellbeing and longevity, including a 2024 study that showed 90 minutes of strength training a week resulted in four years less biological ageing. Maybe that’s why about 15% of the UK population is now a member of a gym. Part of the appeal is accessibility – it’s not as technical as swimming, for example – but despite its simplicity, there’s a huge amount of misinformation and conflicting advice.Low or high reps?
 Strength-training exercises are structured into a number of sets made up of repetitions. For instance, eight lifts, rest, followed by eight further lifts equates to two sets of eight.

The Guardian,All played out: Raheem Sterling in startling decline after hitting the fateful 500 mark | Jonathan Wilson,"The Arsenal forward, once England’s key player, is only 30 but his confidence is shot and his career on a downward curveIn Rafa Benítez’s first season in English football, he rested Steven Gerrard for an FA Cup tie at Burnley, who were in the Championship. When Liverpool lost, there was a predictable backlash and, from certain quarters, derision as Benítez explained his rotation policy and the need to manage the number of minutes each player played.Social media being in its infancy, it wasn’t quite the culture war that it would have become today, but certain old-school football men clearly felt that players should just get on with it: hard work never hurt anyone. But at the same time a piece of ancient wisdom kept surfacing, usually from elderly coaches who had spent a lifetime in the game: as a rule of thumb, however much they play, whatever age they start, a player has 500 games in them.

The Guardian,F1 testing: what we learned from our first look at the class of 2025 in Bahrain,"McLaren the frontrunners in a tight title race, Hamilton reborn at Ferrari and Williams hoping for big thingsConstructors’ champions last season, McLaren finished strongly and the winter has been productive. The MCL39 appears to have a genuine edge on a competitive field. Both Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri were circumspect about their car and it did demonstrate a spot of instability in the rear but their confidence on track has been palpable. They look to have taken the stable platform of last season and improved it with the long-run race simulations presenting a fearsome pace, even given all the usual caveats of fuel loads, temperatures and card-holding in testing. When off the leash for a burst of potentially qualifying pace it was impressive on the brief occasions McLaren opted to show their hand, Norris aborting one flying lap that would have set tongues wagging. That early show of pace has not gone unnoticed by the other teams, with Lewis Hamilton among others acknowledging that McLaren are set to be sharp from the off – the start Norris has long craved for a tilt at the title.

The Guardian,Trump’s style of petty domination was in full display with Zelenskyy | Moira Donegan,"Trump and Vance, I think, never really intended to have a conversation with Zelenskky. Instead, they wanted to look tough on TVThe last time Donald Trump did this, it was in secret, and he got impeached over it. In 2019, Donald Trump, on a phone call with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, demanded that the Ukrainian president produce – or fabricate – evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden, the son of Trump’s eventual opponent in the 2020 election, in exchange for continued US military aide.At the time, Russia had already seized control of the Ukrainian region of Crimea, and was funding violent insurgent groups in the country’s east; it was increasingly clear that a full-scale Russian invasion was coming, as it finally did in 2022. Since the end of second world war, it has been America that checks Russian expansionist ambitions in Europe – America that provided the backstop to the Nato alliance, America that secured the independence of eastern Europe. Trump wanted to condition that longstanding role on Zelenskyy doing him a personal political favor. The international order could be ended, he suggested, if those who depended on him didn’t do enough to indulge his vanity, self-interest and impulsive whims.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist Continue reading...","Sat, 01 Mar 2025 17:00:44 GMT",-0.25,-0.6249

The Guardian,"Wild, waspish and whip-smart, there are few rock stars as great as David Johansen | Alexis Petridis","He looked the part – and sounded even better. And the frontman of New York Dolls, who has died aged 75, was deeper than many gave him credit for• News – David Johansen, frontman of New York Dolls, dies aged 75• Gallery – David Johansen: a life in picturesNick Kent’s fabled 1974 NME piece about New York Dolls, Dead End Kids on the Champs-Élysées, is packed with characters and incident. The band have arrived in France after a showcase gig at London boutique Biba, marred by various members getting caught while attempting to shoplift from the store. Their famously dissolute guitarist Johnny Thunders vomits copiously in front of the assembled press at a record company reception to welcome the band to France, then pukes again midway through a “horrendous, tuneless” Dolls gig at Paris’s prestigious Olympia theatre. Bassist Arthur Kane, a large man clad in a ballerina’s tutu who apparently looks “like he’d just been run over by a truck load of Valium” confides that he’s in fear of his life: the last groupie he slept with tied him up in his sleep and attempted to cut off his thumb with a knife.And yet, even in such exalted company, there’s no doubt who the star of the show is. Frontman David Johansen never appears to stop talking throughout, an endless, wildly entertaining source of tall tales – at one juncture, he claims to have been an underage star of gay porn films – hysterical bitching about other artists (John Lennon is an “asshole hypocrite”, Keith Richards is “past it”, Mott the Hoople’s Ian Hunter has “terrible piggy eyes”) and eminently quotable statements: “We attract only degenerates to our concerts”; “We want to be known as the tackiest boys in New York.” Whatever you made of New York Dolls’ music – and, as the evident distaste with which host Bob Harris greeted their appearance on The Old Grey Whistle Test proved, it was nothing if not divisive – you would have a hard time arguing that Johansen wasn’t fantastically good at the business of being a rock star.

It’s the end of the line for soft, middle-class authors. Lefty-baiting headteacher Katharine Birbalsingh has declared that “gentle parenting” advice books by middle-class writers are sabotaging families by insisting adults become friends with their children.She’s probably got a point – most mums and dads have watched with a cocked eyebrow as a Boden-clad parent has tranquilly informed little Johnny that punching another child in the face while playing in the sandpit “might not be what they like” – but I say Birbalsingh is not going far enough.

Our children are pampered. We raise the coddled brats not as stern parents but simpering friends. We flatter their whims and let them bury their heads in screens. We fetishise what they feel, care not for what they learn, and neglect what they need: that good old-fashioned commonsense discipline that raised the great generations of times past.Inarguably the greatest peddler of this diagnosis is Katharine Birbalsingh, Britain’s Strictest Headmistress™ and co-founder of the Michaela Community School in Wembley, which boasts fastidious adherence to uniforms, timed loo breaks and silent corridors.

The Guardian,Colum McCann: ‘I like having my back against the wall’,"The New York-based Irish author on being compelled to write about the big issues, his fear for friends in the Middle East and why Frankenstein is a metaphor for our timesThe award-winning Irish author Colum McCann was born in Dublin in 1965 and worked as a journalist before moving to the US and turning his hand to books. His novels include Let the Great World Spin, which won the 2011 International Dublin literary award, and 2020’s Apeirogon, which took a kaleidoscopic view of the Israel-Palestine conflict. Last year he co-wrote the memoir American Mother with Diane Foley, whose son, US journalist James Foley, was murdered by Islamic State in Syria in 2014. In his latest novel, Twist (published on 6 March), an Irish journalist on a cable repair ship off the west coast of Africa is confronted by questions of environmental destruction, information overload and colonialism. McCann lives in New York with his wife Allison and their three children.Undersea communications cables are underexplored in fiction. What prompted you to write about them?
 In the early part of the pandemic, I was thinking a lot about the notion of repair, because things were shattering around us fairly frequently. Somewhere I fell upon the story of the Léon Thévenin, a cable repair ship out of South Africa. Like everybody else, I thought that [digital] information went up from our phones and hit these satellites and came back down. I was really taken by the notion that it all happens in the bottom of the deep black sea. Bizarrely, since I started writing it, undersea cables are now being cut left, right and centre – the Houthis in the Red Sea, the Russians and Chinese in the Baltic. We’re going to be talking about it a lot more in the years to come. Continue reading...","Sat, 01 Mar 2025 18:00:44 GMT",0.3612,0.6908

And whose pesto tastes of gravel?• The best kitchen knives for every job – chosen by chefsIt is true that pesto is an incredibly useful jar to have in the cupboard. It is also true that pesto is a hard thing to preserve in a jar in a way that tastes nice. This is especially true if you are working to keep costs down – as consumers, we can all do ballpark sums for the cost of herbs, nuts, cheese and olive oil. I think one of the problems lies with the herbs’ tendency to get a bit muggy during processing, though some makers are doing quite a good job.Just to be clear about nomenclature: pesto, from the Latin pestare, meaning to pound, is a generic word for a whole group of similar mixtures, the general guidelines being to mix any herb with any nut and with any cheese, then pour oil over the top. All the pestos I tasted fall into this general category, and they are called green pesto, Italian pesto or basil pesto. Pesto alla Genovese, on the other hand, is a specific mixture of basil, pine nuts, garlic, parmesan, pecorino and olive oil. Continue reading...","Sat, 01 Mar 2025 10:00:35 GMT",0.0258,0.9614
