The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskyy prepared to offer swap of seized Kursk land,"Ukrainian president does not say which Russian-held territory he would seek in return during any negotiations; Kyiv seeks recruits below draft age. What we know on day 1,085Volodymyr Zelenskyy will offer Vladimir Putin a swap of Ukrainian-occupied territory in Kursk for Russian-held land in Ukraine, if Donald Trump manages to bring them to the negotiating table, Shaun Walker reports. “We will swap one territory for another,” the Ukrainian president said in an exclusive interview, adding that he did not know which part of Russian-occupied land Ukraine would ask for in return. “I don’t know, we will see. But all our territories are important, there is no priority.”Russia released American schoolteacher Marc Fogel on Tuesday after an unannounced visit to Moscow by US special envoy Steve Witkoff. Fogel, 63, had been detained in Russia since August 2021 and was serving a 14-year sentence. Fogel was sentenced to 14 years in prison for drug smuggling over 17 grams of marijuana – which he said was for medical use – in his luggage. Donald Trump called the release a show of good faith from the Russians, Pjotr Sauer writes. “I hope that’s the beginning of a relationship where we can end that war and millions of people can stop being killed.” When combined, some estimates of Russian and Ukrainian casualties – both dead and injured – approach one million.North Korea has sent about 200 long-range artillery guns to Russia, the South Korean news agency Yonhap has reported, quoting the defence ministry in Seoul. The type was not specified, but there have been other reports in recent weeks of Russia receiving Koksan self-propelled artillery guns from Kim Jong-un’s regime.The ministry also estimated North Korea had sent about 11,000 troops to support Russia, with 300 of them since killed and 2,700 wounded. “There is the possibility of [the North] additionally supplying troops, weapons and ammunition going forward,” the ministry said in a briefing to the parliamentary defence committee. The continuing role of North Korean troops in Ukraine has been unclear for several weeks. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service last week said they had been pulled back from the frontline in Kursk amid heavy losses, Justin McCurry reported. Volodymyr Zelenskyy then quickly countered that the North Koreans were back in battle.Poland’s army said a Russian Su-24MR bomber flying from Kaliningrad violated Polish airspace for one minute 12 seconds and flew up to 6.5km into its territory on Tuesday. Poland said the Russian army blamed a navigation system failure. It came a day after Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, announced record-high spending focused on security and spoke of the need to “protect the Baltic Sea from acts of diversion and sabotage”.Ukraine’s defence ministry launched a recruitment drive for young people on Tuesday, encouraging 18- to 24-year-olds to volunteer to serve in the military for a year for the equivalent of about $24,000 plus large bonuses and subsidised mortgages and rents. Ukrainians can be conscripted only once they turn 25. The under-25 volunteer contracts also offer a 12-month exemption from mobilisation when completed.Ukrainian natural gas production facilities were damaged in a heavy Russian missile and drone attack on Ukraine’s central Poltava region over Tuesday night, officials, said on Tuesday.

The Guardian,The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep review – gore flows in bloody animated mer-western,"Lovejoyish dude with magical powers wanders into a seaside kingdom where merpeople and regular humans are at loggerheadsThis animated feature is part of the larger Witcher fantasy franchise which started with short stories by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski and has evolved to survive on all manner of platforms, from video games and comics to live-action TV series and films. Thanks to the wealth of wiki knowledge out there, you can get the gist pretty quickly. There’s a dude with magical powers, fearsome pectorals (and the platinum hair of a Finnish metal band lead singer) named the Witcher, AKA Geralt (voiced here by Doug Cockle); he wanders around a medieval-ish countryside battling monsters, partly for hire and partly out of the goodness of his own gruff heart. He’s like a ronin or a knight or TV-show amateur detective of the Lovejoy vintage, but with a sword. Geralt’s wisecracking sidekick Jaskier (Joey Batey) is cowardly and comical, and plays a lute-like instrument on which he performs ballads celebrating Geralt’s heroics. We also meet (mostly in flashback) Geralt’s on-off romantic partner Yennefer (Anya Chalotra) who can visit his dreams in order to flirt with him, but she’s less of a big deal here than in other Witcher products.Instead, Geralt and Jaskier wash up in a seaside kingdom where merpeople and regular humans are at loggerheads because the humans keep decimating the oyster beds in search of pearls. Shockingly, they don’t make use of the oysters as food, which depletes food sources for the various fantasy animals the merpeople feel are their buddies because they all live in the sea together. It’s the equivalent of a post-colonial western where the merfolk are the Native Americans and the humans are rapacious land-grabbing whites. But the script also threads in a star-crossed lovers’ story involving a mer-princess and a dopey human prince which plays out like a blend of Romeo and Juliet and The Little Mermaid. Plus, because no gen-Z skewed animation would be complete without a trans subtext, there’s a bit of that too at the end. Continue reading...","Tue, 11 Feb 2025 23:47:11 GMT",-0.4404,0.9718

The Guardian,26.2 to Life: Inside the San Quentin Prison Marathon review – the inmates who find redemption in running,"This deeply moving film follows the maximum-security detainees training to run a marathon. It’s a troubling portrait of masculinity, but one which offers hopeChristine Yoo’s intelligent, compassionate and deeply moving film, 26.2 to Life: Inside the San Quentin Prison Marathon, follows some of the inmates of the California maximum-security facility. The men, most of whom are serving life sentences, are preparing to run 100-odd laps of the heavily guarded prison yard, along a barely marked track, weaving in and out of prisoners who do not know or care to stay out of their way. All of them are subject at any time to a minor or major lockdown that will interrupt or even cancel the race for which they have trained all year. They can wear non-prison-issue clothes to run in, but their shoes are the property of the state and have to be booked in and out by each man at every session.The 1000 Mile Club, as the runners are known, are trained by a group of volunteers led by Franklin Ruona, an experienced marathon man himself. A naturally quiet and watchful soul, he doesn’t talk to the men about their crimes unless they want to. His view is that they are people who have not had his luck or advantages: “I just feel like I am my brother’s keeper,” he says. In the febrile prison atmosphere, he is an oasis of calm.

I didn’t pay my tax on time, because I didn’t want to cash in my premium bonds before the end of the month, because maybe I’d win a million pounds. H reckons if she applied herself seriously to writing erotic fanfic, she would definitely make a million pounds. D was wondering what the maximum amount of compensation would be for a range of workplace accidents, what limb you’d have to lose for a million pounds. She’s dreaming.

There has never been any point in two million and it would sound unbelievably pedantic to wish for three. That’s 50 years, during which time the value of one million pounds has changed quite a lot. Half a century ago, you could have bought an island, and now you might get a house with a well-made kitchen island. Yet the word has meant “unimaginably massive” all that time. It never even respected currency variation – when a photo caption once ran “Elizabeth Taylor arrived looking like a million dollars” and the newspaper sub added, per house style, “(£565,000)”, people found that ridiculous; of course she didn’t look like £565,000.

The Guardian,"With a new hit film, Netflix has reduced disabled lives to feelgood fodder – and got the facts shockingly wrong | Archie Bland and Ruth Spencer","This story about a child with cerebral palsy is badly misleading – and a slap in the face for families like oursAmazing news from Netflix: there is an extraordinary treatment available for children with very severe neurological disabilities, one that, given the appropriate level of parental gumption, will grant kids written off as hopeless cases the ability to walk and talk. The medical establishment, populated as it is with hopeless dinosaurs, hasn’t yet absorbed its full significance, and you won’t find it on the NHS, or through mainstream providers in the United States or Europe. But quietly, almost magically, it is already changing lives.The device that provides this treatment, the Cytotron, is the subject of the Mexican movie Lucca’s World, the No 1 non-English-language film on the world’s biggest streaming platform last week. It follows one family – led by a remarkable mother, Bárbara Anderson, on whose memoir the movie is based – as they turn every stone in pursuit of a better life for their little boy. And as soon as Anderson learns about the Cytotron, there is very little room for doubt about its remarkable properties. By “stimulating the damaged brain cells in order for them to become more active and create new connections”, the device can apparently restore the functions that have been destroyed by Lucca’s severe cerebral palsy. “The Cytotron will mark a before and after in the history of medicine,” we learn. It’s “scientifically supported”. Yes, it’s eye-wateringly expensive – $50,000 for a single course of treatment in the movie – but that’s because it’s unprecedented.

The Guardian,"Who thinks creators of deepfake porn can be excused? Labour ministers, it seems | Polly Toynbee","A bill that would ban the creation of these images without consent was watered down by the government. This is where timidity gets youAt an away day last week, Keir Starmer told his cabinet that they must become “disruptors if you don’t want to be disrupted”. Yet timidity, caution and hesitation have damaged too many of Labour’s bold policies. Will Starmer’s new message percolate through to the cabinet – and to their junior ministers, civil servants and official lawyers? This week, one policy decision that went largely unnoticed suggests his party is still far from embracing disruption.Tens of thousands of deepfake porn images are produced every week, many of celebrities, mostly of ordinary women. These obscene AI-generated images have the power to destroy lives, roaming the internet for ever. They can be sent to friends, family, children, school friends, present or future employers. Those who create these poisonous pictures often turn out to be close friends, or people seeking revenge. Nobody thinks this is OK.

The Guardian,What Republicans really mean when they blame 'DEI' | Mehdi Hasan,"Referencing DEI is the new rightwing abstraction deployed by Republicans to conceal their anti-Black racismIn 1981, Lee Atwater, the most influential Republican party strategist of the late 20th century, sat down for an off-the-record interview with the political scientist Alexander P Lamis. At the time, Atwater was a junior member of the Reagan administration, but he would later go on to run George HW Bush’s presidential campaign in 1988 and then become chair of the Republican National Committee in 1989.In perhaps the most revealing, and most infamous, portion of the interview, the hard-charging Republican operative explained to Lamis how Republican politicians could mask their racism – and racist appeals to white voters – behind a series of euphemisms.You start out in 1954 by saying, ‘[N-word, N-word, N-word]’. By 1968 you can’t say ‘[N-word]’ – that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites … ‘We want to cut this,’ is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than ‘[N-word, N-word]’.Mehdi Hasan is the CEO and editor-in-chief of the new media company Zeteo Continue reading...","Tue, 11 Feb 2025 11:00:56 GMT",-0.34,-0.9883
The Guardian,Robert F Kennedy Jr has mass appeal despite his extreme ideas. This theory explains why | Darren Loucaides,"In just a few years, Kennedy and his dangerously popular ‘diagonalist’ politics have gone from the fringes of the web to, perhaps, the White House“Back at home in the United States, the newspapers are saying that I came here today to speak to about 5,000 Nazis,” Robert F Kennedy Jr told a large crowd in Berlin. Estimated at 38,000 people, the crowd was a mix of hippies, anti-war types, Green party voters and anti-vaxxers, rubbing shoulders with a smattering of skinheads. It was late August 2020 and a group called Querdenken had rallied this motley crew together in defiance of Covid-19 restrictions.“Governments love pandemics,” Kennedy said. “They love pandemics for the same reason they love war – it gives them the ability to impose controls that the population would otherwise never accept.”Darren Loucaides is a writer based in Barcelona and LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on campus cuts: academics pay a high price for Westminster’s mistakes | Editorial,"The government should not stand aloof as a crisis unfolds in our universities. A new settlement is neededIn one of David Lodge’s famous campus novels, a young English literature lecturer pictures her university as “the ideal human community, where … people were free to pursue excellence and self‑fulfilment, each according to their own rhythm and inclination”. A non-academic friend comments wryly: “Well, it’s nice work if you can get it.”Nice Work was written in 1988, in part as a fictional response to the Thatcher cuts to higher education at the time. It’s safe to say a contemporary equivalent would need a different title. Forty years on, universities&nbsp;like to sell themselves along the lines of Robyn Penrose’s romantic vision. But the marketised reality for modern university staff, particularly those at&nbsp;the sharp end of a deepening funding crisis, is another world altogether.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on the health service: the problems go deeper than the boss | Editorial,"MPs are right to push for improvements. But it is unclear what recent attacks on NHS England’s Amanda Pritchard will achieveIt was presumably a coincidence that last month’s highly critical report on NHS finances from the House of Commons public accounts committee (PAC) was published just hours before Amanda Pritchard, NHS England’s chief executive, appeared before the health and social care committee. The report accused leaders at the organisation and the Department of Health and Social Care of lacking “drive” and “ideas”. That same day, immediately after Ms Pritchard’s evidence, the health committee issued a statement. Echoing the PAC,&nbsp;it said Ms Pritchard and her team lacked “drive” and “dynamism”.NHS England hit back at the PAC, claiming that MPs did not fully understand the financial processes at issue. Wes Streeting was reported to have “full confidence” in Ms Pritchard, making it clear that her job is not on the line. But this two-pronged attack must have stung. While critical reports like the PAC’s are part and parcel of parliamentary scrutiny, it is highly unusual for public servants to be rebuked for their oral evidence.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Mental health services utterly failed my child | Letters,"Parents write of the agonising attempts to access support for their children, in response to an article about a 17-year-old who killed herself while waiting for therapyThe story about 17-year-old Jen&nbsp;Bridges-Chalkley, who killed herself after enduring a long wait for mental health support, was very hard to read, and almost identical to my son’s experience (The life and death of Jen Bridges-Chalkley: why did a 17-year-old die waiting for NHS therapy?, 6 February). He is now nearly 30, and – by the skin of his teeth – alive. He has tried to kill himself five times. He has rarely wanted to die, but many times he has wanted to stop living.One of those times when he was distraught and suicidal, I rang the child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) out-of-hours “emergency line” repeatedly and left desperate messages. I didn’t even receive a call back that week. The times someone did respond, it was to tell us to call the police to pick up my desperate, terrified child to take him to a hospital where no one cared and he was regarded as a bedblocker. We stopped doing that. Continue reading...","Tue, 11 Feb 2025 17:09:50 GMT",-0.5563,-0.9923

The Guardian,Real Madrid’s Bellingham settles thriller to leave Manchester City on ropes,"Pep Guardiola had made the point that it was “impossible” to control Real Madrid’s front four. You can only hold out for so long against them, the Manchester City manager suggested. They tend to find a way. This Madrid victory was built on their cut and thrust up front, the slickness of their bursts, the sheer speed of them.For a good while, it felt as though Erling Haaland would be the story; another striker who is not in the business of being shackled. The City No 9 had drawn blanks in all four of his previous Champions League ties against Madrid. He had a point to prove and he proved it, twice putting his team in front, the second for 2-1 coming from the penalty spot after Phil Foden, on as a substitute, had been fouled by Dani Ceballos.

The Guardian,Nottingham Forest beat 10-man Exeter on penalties as Devon double denied,"At 11.04pm, at last there was a result, Nottingham Forest avoiding an FA Cup upset against 10-man Exeter City after prevailing from the final fourth-round tie via a 4-2 penalty shootout victory. Neco Williams scored the decisive penalty before Matz Sels, who replaced the injured Carlos Miguel midway through the second half, saved low to his right to deny Reece Cole before Angus MacDonald blasted his spot-kick against the crossbar. It was an absorbing contest – locals craned their necks from the windows of the terraced houses on St James Road to catch a view – but a cruel crescendo for third-tier Exeter.Forest had a man advantage for 53 minutes after Ed Turns was given a straight red card for a high challenge on Morgan Gibbs-White, 23 of which were in second-half stoppage time after Taiwo Awoniyi suffered a concussion and broken nose. The striker received 12 minutes of medical treatment on the pitch but by the end he was well enough to salute the Forest fans, some of whom will do well to return home by 4am. “He is in a lot of pain but with a smile on his face because he did an amazing job, scoring for us,” said Nuno Espírito Santo, relieved about his side’s progress and the injury prognosis.

A different storm awaits on Wednesday when Liverpool cross Stanley Park one last time intent on silencing taunts about blowing the league at the home of their oldest rivals and containing the fallout from a shock FA Cup exit at Plymouth. There is nowhere else Moyes would rather be than in its midst of it all.“Strange it was rearranged,” the 61-year-old said, reflecting on the opportunity that has blown his way since the Merseyside derby was postponed on 7 December, the inevitable consequence of 70mph winds.

He was born in Belgium – not California – in 1899 and lived an avant garde life in Paris where in the 1920s he was photographed by Claude Cahun and hung out with the surrealists. He inherited a tradition of bohemian drug experimentation that went right back to poet Charles Baudelaire and his fellow members of the Hashish Eaters Club, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas.

The Guardian,‘Fans say my concerts are safe spaces where they can forgive’: the cult of Ichiko Aoba,"She sells out large venues, is feted by legends – and adored for her euphoric songs. The remarkable Japanese musician talks about magical islands, sonic sorcery and playing gigs with her eyes shutWhen Ichiko Aoba stood up to perform at London’s St Martin-in-the-Fields in September 2024, most people couldn’t actually see the Japanese singer at first. The Georgian parish church has no stage, just a postage stamp of a red platform. And Aoba is not that tall. “I was a bit nervous,” she says. “Venue staff had told me it would be difficult for people to see, so I kept thinking about how I might massage people, loosen them up.”Aoba, 35, is speaking over video call from Tokyo. Her vibe in conversation is much the same as on stage: quiet but not shy, thoughtful, funny and direct. At St Martin’s, she walked down the aisle, guitar in hand, sat down on the flagstone floor, big white skirts billowing up like powdery snow, and started to sing, unamplified. The audience hushed. Aoba said, “Come closer”, and everyone who could did. Continue reading...","Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:17:07 GMT",0.4404,0.8236
The Guardian,"Dismissed, excluded and now adored: how the female surrealists finally had their revenge","Written off as ‘muses’ and denied entry to the movement, they still produced extraordinary work that is only now being appreciated. We enter a gender-breaking world of occult worship – and cats‘Of course the women were important,” said the artist Roland Penrose in 1982, “but it was because they were our muses.” Penrose was talking to the art historian Whitney Chadwick, who was interviewing him for a book she was writing about women surrealists. “They weren’t artists,” insisted Penrose, who thought she shouldn’t even be writing about them. But Chadwick did anyway – and the result, her 1985 book Women Artists and the Surrealist Movement, fundamentally changed our understanding of both surrealism and female artists.In the 40 years since, many of the women Chadwick wrote about have gained wider fame, but the past few years have seen an explosion of interest in surrealist women. Last year was the 100th anniversary of the Surrealist Manifesto, which was actually two competing manifestos published by competing groups of (male) surrealists in Paris. So it’s unsurprising that we saw so much interest in the movement. But it is striking that the centennial prompted a flurry of interest in the women – who were actually excluded from those groups. Indeed, many weren’t even in Paris. Why the sudden broadening of the lens? Continue reading...","Tue, 11 Feb 2025 15:51:54 GMT",-0.4588,0.9605

The Guardian,"Less bias, better hires: why AI could transform recruitment for SMEs","No system, human or digital, is perfect. But by using artificial intelligence to do a lot of the legwork, SMEs can limit the effects of unconscious bias and free up their people to find the ideal candidate for the jobArtificial intelligence is trained on real intelligence – in other words, content created by humans. Theoretically, if you want AI to spit out fiction, you train it on novels and if you want AI to write job specs, you train it on job descriptions written by people. But there’s a problem here. No matter how hard humans try to be unbiased, we all have some. And an AI that has been trained on human work will take on some of these human biases. Indeed, overcoming biases is one of the biggest challenges in AI.“In recruitment, bias is everywhere and comes from a baseline of most recruitment processes being run by humans,” says Kevin Fitzgerald, UK managing director of Employment Hero, a global employment management platform that is using AI to make doing business easier for SMEs. “The underlying bias that recruitment teams have is there in the process already.” Continue reading...","Thu, 19 Dec 2024 09:40:03 GMT",0.3642,0.985

The Guardian,"‘Unusually soft, mushy, oddly bland’: the best (and worst) baked beans, tasted and rated by Felicity Cloake","Our resident perfectionist applies her forensic insight to the high street’s baked bean offerings• The food filter: which supermarket has the best extra-virgin olive oil?Baked beans are one of those homely foods that are so familiar that most of us don’t give them even a second thought on the shelf – we reach for our usual brand, tick it off the list and reserve our mental bandwidth for more exciting foodstuffs. After all, just how different can a tin of beans be? To my surprise, I discovered very striking disparities between the ones I tested, so if you’re someone who routinely decants excess juice or reduces the sauce to achieve that authentic school dinner effect, you might be better off simply switching allegiance. Similarly, the sugar content varied between 9% of your recommended daily allowance to 13%, so if that’s a concern, look out for reduced- or no-sugar brands instead.There’s a significant price difference between supermarket own labels and the leading brands, too. If you’re after a gourmet experience, I’d recommend the Bold Bean Co’s rich tomato baked beans (£3.50), because they remind me of those homemade beans you sometimes get with a fry-up at fancy cafes: intensely savoury and packed full of herbs. They don’t qualify here, because they are to ordinary baked beans what rye sourdough is to white sliced, but they’re bloody lovely all the same. That said, you can’t go wrong with any of our best buys served on buttered toast with a light dusting of grated cheddar. Small pleasures don’t come much cheaper.

Email feast@theguardian.comI often find green cabbage boring. How can I make it more interesting?The cabbage family is vast and, just like most families, its members differ hugely in shape and size, from long and pointed to rotund with solid hearts. What the green members all have in common, however, is their receptiveness to multiple situations, from braising to layering into lasagne, which is good news for those who think they’re a bit dull.Merlin Labron-Johnson, chef/owner of Osip and The Old Pharmacy, both in Bruton, Somerset, is no such person, though: “Cabbages are much more versatile than people give them credit for,” he says, “but you do need to apply a bit of imagination.” That might mean blanching the leaves, stuffing them with sausagemeat – “sometimes, I add pistachios, too” – then rolling and braising in the oven. “That’s an interesting way to use up a savoy cabbage.” He suggests serving these cabbage parcels with some pumpkin puree. Alternatively, put hispi in a pot roast: halve the cabbage and lay it cut side down in a hot pan with lots of oil, to get some nice caramelisation. “Finish it in the oven, then carve and dress with chopped herbs, toasted nuts [almonds or hazelnuts, say] or pine nuts, perhaps a few raisins, and a bit of vinegar and olive oil.”Got a culinary dilemma?

She was one of 18 people who died and he was the sole survivor. He describes the pain, fear and long, winding path of recoveryStuart Diver woke up to a roar that sounded like a low-flying plane. The floor was shaking. The windows rattled. It was 11.35pm and 4,000 tons of mud, building and debris was hurtling down the mountainside in Thredbo, New South Wales, towards Bimbadeen Lodge, where he had been asleep with his wife, Sally. In a few short seconds, the ceiling of their apartment caved in and they were entombed by the concertinaed building. Diver fumbled around in the pitch black room for a way out, cutting his hands and feet on broken glass. But there was nowhere to go.“I heard the noise and put my head up, but as I rolled forward the wrought iron headboard came down and pinned Sally to the bed.” Freezing cold water from a broken mains water pipe on the road above them soon started “flying around”.

As part of an experiment on iron absorption, 21 Indian women had been fed chapatis baked with radioactive isotopes, apparently without their consent.Having grown up in Coventry’s tight-knit South Asian community, Akhter was shocked that she had never heard of the experiment. When she looked into it, she found an inquiry by the Coventry Health Authority in 1995 conducted soon after the documentary aired. The inquiry examined whether the experiment put the subjects’ health at risk and whether informed consent was obtained. But the only mention of the women’s perspectives was a single sentence: “At the public meeting, it was stated that two of the participants who had come forward had no recollection of giving informed consent.” Continue reading...","Tue, 11 Feb 2025 05:00:08 GMT",-0.1695,-0.6542

The Guardian,Lucy Letby and the medical experts who believe she is innocent – podcast,"She was called the worst child serial killer in Britain in modern times. So why are medical experts saying her conviction is unsafe? Josh Halliday and Felicity Lawrence reportLucy Letby was convicted for the murder and attempted murder of more than a dozen babies. She has been called the worst child serial killer the UK had seen. But even before the trial was over experts had begun raising concerns about her conviction.Then, last week, came a bombshell press conference in which a panel of renowned neonatal experts said they believed not just that Letby’s conviction was unsafe - but that there was no murder or deliberate harm. Instead they said the deaths had been caused by a series of factors including understaffing and a lack of skills on the ward to treat the babies they were caring for. So what is the evidence that the panel was looking at and why do so many questions seem to swirl around the Letby trial? Continue reading...","Tue, 11 Feb 2025 03:00:05 GMT",0.34,-0.8482

The Guardian,500lb black bear survives LA wildfires hiding under house – video,"For those lucky enough to have a place to return to in Altadena, going home meant dealing with unfinished chores left behind when the Eaton fire forced them to evacuate. For Samy Arbid, who had moved into a property just a block from the fire line in November, there was a different kind of challenge: a 525lb (240kg) black bear. It had moved into the crawl space under the house before the fire and was still sheltering there when Arbid and his wife returned. The California wildfire department stepped in to help, luring the bear out with treats after deciding it was too big to tranquillise.

The Guardian,"The big picture: wedding celebrations in London’s Banglatown, 1991","Wayne Tippetts’s shot of young Bangladeshi women preparing for a Gaye Holud ceremony is part of a series exploring a pivotal moment in the  neighbourhood’s historyWayne Tippetts took this picture in what became known as Banglatown – the area between Brick Lane and Whitechapel High Street east of the City of London – in 1991. Tippetts was, he recalls, in the habit at the time of walking up from near the river at Wapping where his photo agency, Select, had its offices, and taking pictures of the Bangladeshi community, families who had mostly arrived in London in the 1970s. Tippetts’s pictures have now become a monograph that captures a pivotal moment in the history of that ever-changing part of London, when second-generation Bangladeshis were starting to assert their cultural identity, and to feel fully at home.In this image, the photographer recalls, “young Bangladeshi women, known as ‘sakhis’, friends of the bride, had gathered outside her home on a council estate in Tower Hamlets”. The women were preparing to shower other guests from the balcony with yellow and red flower petals and sweets during the Gaye Holud ceremony, a pre-wedding tradition. Though embracing the customs of their parents, Tippetts notes, the young people he met, including these young women, were at that time balancing that heritage with “multicultural influences of fashion, music, and youth subcultures that were flourishing in the city at the time”.Wayne Tippetts – Banglatown, London 1991 is published by Café Royal Books (£6.70) Continue reading...","Sun, 09 Feb 2025 07:00:42 GMT",0.0,0.743
