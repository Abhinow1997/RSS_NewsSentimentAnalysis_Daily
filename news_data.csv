The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Five killed and homes damaged in series of Russian and Ukrainian attacks,"Residential area in Chernigiv, north of Kyiv, among those hit as Zelenskyy says Russia launched 300 attack drones and nearly 20 missiles in first three days of 2025. What we know on day 1,045See all our Ukraine war coverageAt least five people were killed in a series of Russian and Ukrainian strikes on Friday, including an afternoon Russian missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Chernigiv which left at least one person dead and damaged a residential area, officials said. “Several houses were heavily damaged. There are wounded,” regional governor Vyacheslav Chaus said. “Search and rescue operations are ongoing.” Loud explosions were heard in the city, located to the north of the capital, Kyiv, about 75km (46 miles) from the Russian border. The city head said four had been wounded in the strikes, according to initial reports. Separate Russian bombardments on Friday killed a truck driver near Kyiv and a pensioner in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, local officials said. Four were hurt when the town of Sloviansk was shelled near the frontline in the Donetsk region, officials said. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Telegram that in the first three days of 2025 Russia had launched 300 attack drones and nearly 20 missiles on Ukrainian targets. Most, he said, had been downed or intercepted.Ukrainian attacks on Russian border areas killed two people, according to local governors. One was killed by a mortar strike on a village in the Bryansk region, officials said. Near the frontlines in the Kursk region, where Ukraine launched an offensive last August, a man walking down a road was killed in a drone strike, the regional governor said. Moscow and Kyiv have escalated their aerial campaigns through the first weeks of winter in what has been seen as an attempt to gain the upper hand ahead of US president-elect Donald Trump taking office later in January.The US expects to make announcements about additional security assistance for Ukraine in coming days, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Friday. He said future announcements were expected, without providing specifics, after Washington last week announced $5.9bn in additional military and budget assistance for Ukraine and that a meeting of the Ukraine defence contact group in Germany would be held on 9 January.The breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria ordered rolling blackouts on Friday as a halt in Russian gas supplies earlier this week plunged the self-proclaimed state into crisis. The breakaway region bordering Ukraine has been unable to provide heating and hot water to its residents since Wednesday, when Moscow cut off gas supplies to Moldova over a financial dispute. “In Transnistria today, 3 January, there will be rolling blackouts. This is because inhabitants of the republic are currently consuming more electricity than is produced by the energy system,” Transnistria’s economy ministry said on Telegram. Parts of Transnistria’s largest city, Tiraspol – including a neighbourhood home to a maternity hospital – would lose power, as well as smaller towns and villages, it said.Oil from two ageing and damaged Russian tankers was detected on Friday off the coast of Sevastopol, the largest city in Moscow-annexed Crimea, a local official said. The Volgoneft-212 and the Volgoneft-239 were hit by a storm last month in the Kerch strait linking Crimea to the southern Russian Krasnodar region, about 250km from Sevastopol. One sank and the other ran aground, pouring about 2,400 tonnes of a heavy fuel oil called mazut into the surrounding waters, Russia’s transport ministry said. “A small oil slick reached Sevastopol today,” the Moscow-installed head of the city, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said on Telegram, publishing a video of the oil. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has called the tanker spills an “ecological disaster”. Continue reading...","Sat, 04 Jan 2025 02:09:02 GMT",-0.9349,-0.9948

The Guardian,‘His books animated academia for me’: how David Lodge inspired my campus novel,"His trilogy captured my heart – and while Amis, Bradbury and Jacobson spoke to me, Lodge’s writing had an extra somethingDavid Lodge, Campus Trilogy novelist and academic, dies aged 89‘It’s largely thanks to him that the British comic novel remains in good health’: David Lodge remembered by Jonathan CoeDavid Lodge was already a lauded novelist in 1987, when I arrived at the unassuming doors of Foster Court on Malet Place to study English literature and language at University College London. Lodge had taken the same course there himself more than 30 years before, got a first and went on to do a master’s there, too. His name was spoken with pride in hushed, reverent tones – and this was a department that would happily dismiss anything published after 1850 as hopelessly modern. I dutifully bought Changing Places to see what the fuss was about.The campus novel was a serious literary genre then – Kingsley Amis, Malcolm Bradbury and Howard Jacobson were prominent names and their novels spoke to me at the time, because I was navigating that scary world myself – but within a single chapter I saw immediately that Lodge’s writing had an extra something: he was properly funny. Not just subtly clever or wryly satirical. Not somewhat amusing if you’ve read the entire works of John Milton and are up to speed on hot trends in lit crit, no – they were bright, lively and laugh-out-loud hilarious, with as many sex and toilet jokes as literary references. His characters were flawed in a real way and became entangled in farcical situations that were completely believable. I was hooked, and explored his backlist like a true fan – or like a student of English who should really have been reading the Romantics.

Don’t let Trump and his allies tell you otherwise | Arwa Mahdawi,"Four years on, it’s the most astounding case of collective amnesia. That so many seem willing to normalise that anti-democratic outrage is frighteningThe sun shone brightly on 6 January 2021. The birds chirped, children frolicked and thousands of unarmed patriots gathered peacefully in Washington DC for a “day of love”. It was a beautiful gathering in support of US democracy. In the words of incoming president Donald Trump, “nothing done wrong at all”.Perhaps that’s not quite how you remember the scenes of violent mobs storming the Capitol that were broadcast around the world four years ago. Perhaps that’s not how you, personally, would characterise an event in which more than 140 police officers were viciously assaulted and four people died; a furious riot in which crowds chanted “hang Mike Pence” and set up a makeshift gallows. But it’s certainly how a significant number of people seem to remember it: 6 January seems to have been alarmingly normalised – a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll published last year found about seven in 10 Republicans think too much fuss is being made about the event and that it is “time to move on”.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist and the author of Strong Female Lead Continue reading...","Fri, 03 Jan 2025 13:35:55 GMT",0.0,-0.2152

Then plans changed, as they often do, and they gave birth to a baby boy four years after moving in. Overnight, the bedroom doubled as a nursery and the open-plan living space functioned as a kitchen, dining room, living room and playroom. For lack of space, the pram was parked outside in the communal corridor. Soon, complaints landed in their inbox from the building management company stating that it posed a fire risk.

The Guardian,This play's abortion scene made grown men faint – and I’m thrilled it’s about to get a bigger audience | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett,"Annie Ernaux’s The Years is transferring to the West End. It’s about time the arts confront the way women’s bodies workFollowing a sold-out run at the Almeida theatre, this month The Years – a stage adaptation of Annie Ernaux’s choral novel of 21st-century womanhood – transfers to the West End. The play became somewhat notorious because of the impact that its abortion scene was having on audience members. In the scene, a bloodied Romola Garai recounts passing a dead foetus after an illegal backstreet abortion, a performance our theatre critic described as “devastating”. A preview last summer had to be stopped as several audience members requested medical assistance, while another shouted at the cast that the scene had been “a disgrace” and protested that “there was no warning” (content notes were, in fact, provided).As I wrote in the autumn, I had assumed these fainters were women, triggered by the trauma of past experiences, but that was sexist of me. It was in fact mostly men who were passing out, and a man who yelled at the cast. No one fainted when I saw the play, but someone did leave, and another audience member, head in hands, looked distinctly green about the gills. As the play opens to even larger audiences and more exposure, it will be interesting to see if the faintings – and the headlines – continue, or if staging the play in a less intimate theatre changes the scene’s impact.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on a carbon-free economy: no just transition in sight – yet,"Factory closures highlight the turbulent shift to a green economy, exposing political challenges and the urgent need for a equitable move to net zeroOne of the biggest political battles of the future began to take shape in 2024, yet it did not centre on Westminster. Instead, try Grangemouth in central Scotland, Port Talbot in south Wales and Luton in the south of England. Their stories were not front-page staples, but each was of huge significance – locally, nationally and&nbsp;economically.Grangemouth is Scotland’s sole oil refinery, whose owners confirmed in September that it would shut, to be replaced by a terminal taking in imported fuel – with&nbsp;nearly 400 workers losing their jobs. In the last&nbsp;days of September, the only remaining blast&nbsp;furnace&nbsp;at Port Talbot was shut down, as part of a restructuring that will cost 2,800 employees their jobs. At the end of November, staff at Vauxhall in Luton were told the plant would shut, ending 120 years of the carmaker’s association with the town and putting between 1,100 and 2,000 jobs at risk. One&nbsp;result was two&nbsp;days of protests in the town a week&nbsp;before&nbsp;Christmas.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on the Shipping Forecast at 100: the radio’s prayer | Editorial,"‘Around the Bay of Biscay and back for tea’. The weather bulletin has inspired poets and popstars and become our national lullabyIt is no surprise that the Shipping Forecast, which turned 100 on New Year’s Day, is one of the cultural touchstones of our times. The weather is our national obsession, after all. Alan Bennett and John Prescott have read it, while poets Seamus Heaney, Sylvia Plath and Carol Ann Duffy have been inspired by it, along with musicians Tears for Fears, Radiohead and Blur. To mark its centenary, BBC Radio 4 devoted a day to celebrate this twice-daily bulletin and its place in the British psyche.In her diary, in January 1925, Virginia Woolf reported that it was “all gale &amp; flood; these words are exact” over New Year in East Sussex. And so it was a century later. Listening to the familiar refrains – Dogger, Fisher, German Bight – while wind and rain lashed outside, was a warm bath for the soul. Gavin and Stacey’s Ruth Jones read that day’s report as Nessa. But with parts of the country experiencing terrible flooding, it was a reminder of the dangers that led to its creation. This mixture of consolation and distant drama goes to the heart of what has come to be known as “the nation’s&nbsp;lullaby”.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Nostalgic memories of home and a carefree childhood | Letters,"Readers respond to Michael Rosen’s reminisces on where he was brought upThe home I grew up in had, like Michael Rosen’s, a geyser over the bath (My shirts reeked of onions; my father hated the ‘phoney Tudor windows’. That flat will always mean home, 24 December). Only my mother was brave enough to light it, as it made explosive noises when exposed to flame. That was in the bathroom, the only room in the flat without a coal fire. Our flat was on the top floor of a corner house in Kingly Street, behind Liberty in Regent Street, London, and once had clearly been the servants’ quarters of a great house.It had high windows and many rooms, and the kitchen had a huge built-in dresser, an enormous sink and a dumb waiter. In front of the kitchen range was a large sofa, and there was a big table at which my mother and aunt sat and sewed jackets for Savile Row firms, and I later did my homework.

The Guardian,Working on a world free of nuclear arms | Letters,"Readers Aaron Tovish, Diana Francis and Caroline Westgate respond to our editorial about arms control to prevent nuclear warThank you for addressing this existential threat to our world (The Guardian view on arms control: essential to prevent the total devastation of nuclear war, 27 December). It would seem a no-brainer that the logical corollary to “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought” would be to unconditionally renounce all options to initiate nuclear warfare. To date, only two nuclear-armed states have taken this stance: China and India. It seems to have served them well – at least as well as those that retain the option of escalating a conventional war into a nuclear war.In an armed conflict between nuclear powers, it is courting disaster to make your adversary worry about being “beaten to the nuclear punch”, but Nato continues to consider the threat of escalating to nuclear warfare essential to the cohesion of the alliance. This policy urgently needs to be jettisoned. Continue reading...","Fri, 03 Jan 2025 17:29:45 GMT",0.5106,-0.9672
The Guardian,Systems evangelist Amorim meets Slot’s simpler pragmatism at Anfield | Barney Ronay,"Manchester United’s new manager is increasingly looking like an odd hire, especially compared to the successful succession at their arch rivalsPerhaps the most striking aspect of Ruben Amorim’s time at Manchester United is the physical effect of the job, the altered optics. Amorim turned up at Old Trafford looking like a handsome pirate: the jawline, the seigneurial smile, the elite Euro-cardigan styling, the sense that here is someone who smells at all times of high-spec automobile upholstery.Seven weeks in he has the air of a doomed royal hostage, shuttled joylessly from corridor to touchline by unseen handlers. The smile has fractured, the shoulders have drooped. Most recently United’s head coach has developed a habit of dropping down on to his haunches mid-match and staring deep into the Old Trafford turf, as though searching for a) a contact lens; and b) the remaining fragments of his own shredded and tender soul.

Ten-man rugby, like asceticism, was pretty much invented for January.Yet it is a concept that these days feels totally alien to the Premiership.

The audience of mostly retired men nodded slowly along.Versions of this unusual scene played out in towns and cities across Germany in November in a weeklong PR blitz to promote heat pumps – a clean alternative to gas-burning boilers.

The Guardian,The Little Mermaid review – musical fable is a valentine to the oceans,"Bristol Old VicIn Sonali Bhattacharyya’s tale, Liana Cottrill’s striking and gracefully realised mermaid is driven to leave her home not for a crush on a prince but in order to save the seasIn Hans Christian Andersen’s fairytale, the oceans are cornflower-blue and clear as purest glass. But retelling The Little Mermaid today calls for a consideration of environmental damage and Disney’s 2023 blockbuster had Ariel’s father, King Triton, rebuking humans for disrespectfully “spoiling our waters” with the wreckage of their adventuring.Directed by Miranda Cromwell, Sonali Bhattacharyya’s eco-fable is a timely call to arms for young audiences (it’s aimed at over-sevens). Her mermaid, Sereia (Liana Cottrill), is primarily driven to leave her home not for a crush on a prince but in order to save the dying Coral (personified by Nandi Bhebhe). And what better tragic villain than oil itself, in the demonic character of Coral’s sibling Inky Slick (Alison Fitzjohn), exploited by the world above the water and polluting the depths? If only Sereia’s beloved, the nature-loving Kai (John Leader), wasn’t the son of shameless oil profiteers (Michael Elcock and Corrina Buchan).

But is all this success representative of the country as a whole? And if not, why not?It’s time for some good news. The narrative in the arts (and everywhere else) in the 2020s is so often one of cuts, closures and belt-tightening. But in one corner of east London, there still flickers a spirit of 2012 (remember the halcyon days of 2012?!). Opposite the London Stadium in Stratford’s Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park a string of new cultural venues is coming to life. Students buzz around the London College of Fashion; there’s the V&amp;A East museum and BBC music studios both set to open in 2026; and at the end&nbsp;of the row, just across from Zaha Hadid’s London Aquatics Centre, is&nbsp;the&nbsp;brand new Sadler’s Wells East, a&nbsp;dedicated dance theatre opening its doors in February.A sister venue to the original Sadler’s Wells theatre in Islington, this&nbsp;is the biggest thing to happen for dance in the capital for a long while, certainly in terms of visibility. More than 20 million people visited the park last year, and millions more will now pass the O’Donnell and Tuomey-designed building’s striking sawtooth roof, the neon sign above its door announcing “You Are Welcome”, hoping to entice them into the beautiful space inside, with its rows of glowing bulbs hanging above the bar, six studios upstairs and a 550-seat auditorium.

Andrew Garfield and the director John Crowley talk about portraying grief on screen so it rings trueIt’s no spoiler to say that We Live in Time is a tearjerker. It begins with the late-stage cancer diagnosis of its female lead, Almut (Florence Pugh), a rising star chef. The story then leaps back and forth through time to paint a picture of her relationship with Tobias, a cereal marketing executive (Andrew Garfield): the charming meet-cute (a car crash), their early courtship, the birth of their daughter in a service station loo. At the London premiere, one woman near me cried so much as the credits rolled that she felt compelled to apologise to everyone in the vicinity.“I think that’s a shame,” says Garfield. “That someone would feel that they had to apologise.
