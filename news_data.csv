 The three-week old baby was the third to die from the cold in Gaza’s tent camps in recent days, doctors said.The deaths underscore the squalid conditions there, with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians crammed into often ramshackle tents after fleeing Israeli offensives. 
 Israel’s bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count.

But experts have warned that using them recreationally risks doing more harm than good.
 Trials exploring psilocybin as a groundbreaking treatment for mental health conditions has spawned a proliferation of psychedelic companies and retreats in countries where they are legal, while more people are buying the drug, which is class A in the UK, on the hidden market.The latest Office for National Statistics data shows that psilocybin was the only illegal drug that grew in popularity in 2024, increasing by 37.5% to reach 1.1% of 16- to 59-year-olds, representing about 300,000 people and making the drug nearly as popular as ecstasy.

Van Voorthuysen had set herself a fairly low bar: learn how to use power tools. But she left with much more – the skills to build her own tiny home.The 34-year-old bought the shell of a small house, parked it in a Nelson paddock at the top of the South Island, installed solar panels and added a composting toilet. The dwelling measures 6m x 2.4m and is 4m tall. The space took a bit of getting used to and the outdoor shower is “pretty gnarly in winter,” Van Voorthuysen says.

Her barnstorming 2013 Super Bowl performance, complete with a Destiny’s Child reunion, was outdone by her guest appearance during Coldplay’s own 2016 half-time show as she homaged the Black Panthers and freaked out a sizeable quotient of the US establishment (“It is now ‘cool’ to embrace violence, mayhem, and frankly even racial separatism in the cause of civil rights”, the right-wing Heritage Foundation thinktank fumed at the time). Her 2018 Coachella performance, Homecoming, though not on a football field, featured college football’s majorettes and marching bands as she celebrated historically Black colleges and universities.On Wednesday – in a Christmas Day half-time show streamed on Netflix from her native Houston as the Texans played the Baltimore Ravens – she again used a football game as somewhere for her to interrogate and play around with American iconography.

The conclusion of the writers’ strike was supposed to have provided for the primacy of creative humanity, and for keeping AI in its place as a tool. But studios are keen to find efficient and profitable ways to exploit their intellectual property and Lionsgate has actually signed a deal with artificial intelligence firm Runway to engage with their back catalogue.

The Guardian,The best Christmas companions possible: Wallace & Gromit’s triumphant TV return,"Feathers McGraw is back – and more menacing than ever. Our claymation heroes’ delightful attempt to face him is hilariously packed with jokes – they’re just incapable of bad televisionFor many, the highlight of the entire Christmas schedule will have been a treat rare enough to savour: a new Wallace &amp; Gromit. Thirty-five years after their charmingly slapdash debut, A Grand Day Out, the claymation duo are the closest thing this country has to Mickey Mouse – beloved, instantly recognisable icons that make us yearn for a golden time in our history that never actually existed.Part of the claymation duo’s charm is how sparingly they’re deployed. Since A Grand Day Out, they have only appeared on screen for about three hours, half of which came in the form of the feature film (terrifyingly, nearly 20 years old) The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. So a new outing, make no mistake, is an extremely big deal. Continue reading...","Wed, 25 Dec 2024 19:30:19 GMT",0.8225,0.948
The Guardian,Gavin & Stacey: The Finale review – you will be forcibly moved to tears,"This final farewell to the hugely loved sitcom is profoundly bittersweet. Alongside the laughs, it’s a beautiful, poignant piece of televisionI’m not crying, you’re crying. OK, fine – I’m bawling my eyes out. And not just because it’s time to say a final farewell to Gavin, Stacey and the rest of the Barry and Billericay contingents – but because their swansong is a beautiful, extraordinarily poignant bonanza of nostalgia, love and (eventually) wish-fulfilment. If these characters don’t already have a place in your heart, this emotional 90-minute goodbye probably won’t change that. But if they do, prepare to be forcibly moved to tears.British comedy has long relied on the Christmas special: our greatest sitcoms tend to bow out at their peak, but the festive revival traditionally comes to the rescue, extending the lifespans of iconic shows such as The Royle Family and Only Fools and Horses by a decade or more. If there’s still any doubt, Gavin &amp; Stacey (which ostensibly concluded in 2010) belongs firmly in the same modern classic category. This is not just because of its gargantuan popularity (it may qualify as the last properly mainstream sitcom, airing just before streaming fragmented the zeitgeist), but because of its quality. Don’t be fooled by its straightforward accessibility – Ruth Jones and James Corden’s romcom perfectly offset its superficial sweetness with an undercurrent of sour edge. Best of all, it doubled as a joyous hymn to humdrum British life, instilling mind-numbing minutiae with cheer and turning mundane small talk into a kind of poetry.Gavin &amp; Stacey: The Finale aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.

The Guardian,"Doctor Who: Joy to the World review – a warm, moving Christmas special for the ages","Nicola Coughlan and Ncuti Gatwa’s comic timing is impeccable, but it’s the touching way this festive episode grapples with yuletide isolation that makes it a classicThere are so many things to love about Christmas: twinkly lights, desserts to set on fire and, of course, Doctor Who specials. But while I am in cheerful mood, wearing a Christmas jumper and having followed breakfast with advent-calendar chocolates, I am aware that for many people this is the loneliest time of year. So it is for Joy (Nicola Coughlan), the new addition to the Doctor Who family, whom we meet checking into a spartan hotel room by herself for a week over the festive period. Fortunately, she is about to make a new friend in the form of the Doctor, who enters her room in pursuit of a green-skinned alien from the future, grinning from ear to ear as he offers her “a cheese toastie and a pumpkin latte”.While Ncuti Gatwa’s first Christmas special, The Church on Ruby Road, was a delightful proper introduction to the show’s radiant new star (previously, he had briefly appeared in The Giggle, starring David Tennant), the stakes on that outing were markedly lower. In Joy to the World, rather than being tasked with rescuing a baby from pop-singing goblins, the Doctor is trying to prevent the end of planet Earth – though explaining what he is saving it from would enter serious spoiler territory. Suffice to say that most of the action takes place over the festive season in London in 4202, where residents of a glitzy hotel can visit key moments in history, chasing up their mulled wine with a trip on the Orient Express in 1926, or to Everest’s base camp in 1953 or, for some bizarre reason, the London blitz. Joy’s present-day Christmas interruption escalates quickly and the only way to buy the pair enough time to stop the apocalypse leaves the Doctor trapped in London for a year while Joy is in 4202 with his future self.

The Guardian,Better Man review – Robbie Williams becomes CGI chimp in surreal biopic,"A candid look at the toxic force of envy that drove his musical career but turned a talented musician into a deeply unhappy man. But why the CGI?Robbie Williams – only he is a chimp! This is a pretty trad music biopic, coming with the accepted U-shaped narrative arc of humble beginnings, big break, superstardom, drugs, drink, shallow sex, dark-night-of-the-soul slump and redemptive comeback, here topped off with an unendurably protracted performance of My Way at the Royal Albert Hall in London. But the whole thing is given a cheeky high-concept twist by portraying the singer as an ape – a shrieking, scowling, capering CGI chimp – while all around are humans. Actor Jonno Davies plays the part in motion capture and Williams himself supplies the voiceover.The idea supposedly comes from Williams’s fear that he is immature and unevolved, stranded emotionally for ever at the age he became famous: 15. And this chimp figure runs counter to his 2001 song Better Man, with its poignant, maybe Darwinian yearning for improvement: “As my soul heals the shame/I will grow through this pain/Lord, I’m doing all I can/To be a better man.” Continue reading...","Wed, 25 Dec 2024 09:00:06 GMT",0.4404,0.9562

But there was a kicker. “He was never tested because PSG just rolled the ball out and it then took them 20 minutes to get to the halfway line!” It didn’t immediately scream “Scottish Premiership midfielder”, thought McLeish, picturing Aberdeen away on a wild, wet, winter’s afternoon.

This was the year virtual reality threatened to go mainstream, with prices becoming more attainable and Apple entering the market, and so I wanted to see how far VR has come since I first tried it in the mid-2010s, when the main experiences on offer were nausea-inducing rollercoaster simulators. I used a recent model from Meta, called the Quest 3, and the conclusion was clear: this thing now works. It feels a little unfinished, but we’ve reached the point where VR could at last become genuinely useful. Continue reading...","Wed, 25 Dec 2024 12:00:10 GMT",0.2263,0.2732
The Guardian,What’s occurrin’? Gavin & Stacey has breathed new life into my hometown | Simon Price,"The Barry I grew up in was a far cry from its peak as a thriving coal port then a holiday destination. It took an unassuming sitcom to give it a lifelineYou know a town has a PR problem when it needs to catch fire to get attention. In 1984, my home town of Barry made the evening news when the Dock Offices caught fire. Even without the TV coverage, I could see the blaze from my bedroom window. I don’t recall my exact reaction to the spectacle, but one thing I definitely didn’t say was “What’s occurin’?”: because that piece of famous Barry parlance wouldn’t be invented for almost 20 years.As the cameras captured the flames flickering around the nearby statue of industrialist David Davies, Barry’s own Jebediah Springfield, it seemed symbolic. It was Davies who, spurred on by a grudge against rival coal magnates from nearby Cardiff, turned Barry from a few scattered cottages into a thriving dock town. By 1913, it was the biggest coal-exporting port in the world. For most of the 20th century, however, it languished in near-anonymity.Simon Price is a music journalist and author Continue reading...","Wed, 25 Dec 2024 08:00:06 GMT",0.0,0.2023
The Guardian,The birth of Jesus would probably have been forgotten – if it wasn’t for a plague | Jonathan Kennedy,"When a terrifying Ebola-like pandemic struck the Roman empire, Christianity offered solutions that the old ways didn’tIn our Christmas imagery, ancient symbols such as fir trees, mistletoe, holly and ivy sit alongside the baby Jesus, Virgin Mary, angels and shepherds. This mixture of pagan and Christian traditions reminds us that Christmas was superimposed on to much older midwinter festivities. Yet had it not been for a devastating pandemic that swept through the Roman empire in the third century AD, the birth of Jesus would probably not feature at all in our winter solstice celebrations.If the New Testament is to be believed, Jesus managed to fit a great deal into his short life. But despite all his wise words, good deeds and miracles – not to mention the promise of everlasting life – Christ was nothing more than the leader of an obscure sect of Judaism when the Romans crucified him in AD33.Jonathan Kennedy teaches politics and global health at Queen Mary University of London and is the author of Pathogenesis: How Germs Made History Continue reading...","Wed, 25 Dec 2024 10:00:07 GMT",-0.2263,0.5674

The Guardian,I had strict rules to keep my British and Italian lives separate. Then I learned the joy of being both | Silvia Saunders,"I would elbow my mum when she spoke Italian in England, until I realised each part of my identity is more than just a ‘half’In our end of year series, writers and public figures remember the place or time when they felt most at homeSince I was small, I have liked sitting on stairs to read. In my childhood home, in Nuneaton, I favoured the square of carpet between the two flights, positioned directly opposite the wall-mounted clock, so I could keep an eye on how many pages I could squeeze in before bed. My favourite place to read, though, has always been the red tiled steps that lead to the front door of my nonna’s house in Puglia. There are photos of me and my cousins on those steps at every age. If I close my eyes, I can feel the terracotta under my hands, somehow always warm, even in deepest winter.Throughout my childhood, I grappled with the question: “Ti senti più inglese o più italiana?” – do you feel more English or more Italian? I’m British-Italian, and most of my family live in the heel of Italy’s boot, in a very small town of – at the last census – 6,200 inhabitants. My mum is one of five siblings, and the only one who moved any real distance from San Donaci, relocating to the Midlands for love, before having me, her only child.Silvia Saunders is an author.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on the House of Lords: ministers risk a hollow reform with a partisan approach | Editorial,"Over the holidays, this column will explore next year’s urgent issues. Today, why it is easier to be a constitutional reformer in opposition than in officeNext year, the remaining hereditary members of the House of Lords will finally lose their right to sit in the upper house. When that happens, a democratic milestone in British parliamentary history will unquestionably have been reached. But a milestone along a road to what eventual constitutional destination? We do not know the answer to that, because the government will not say. The government itself may not be sure. As on many other issues, Labour’s true direction of travel on House of Lords reform remains obscure.One thing, however, can already be said. Last week, Downing Street published a list of 38 new life peers. It was one of the longest such lists of the modern era. It contained 30 new Labour peers, six Conservatives and two Liberal Democrats. Many were former MPs. The overall aim, as the nominations made extremely clear, was to boost Labour’s numbers in the Lords at the expense of the Conservatives.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on the tenacity of hope: a necessary virtue in troubled times | Editorial,"At a moment of the year associated with renewal and new birth, reflection on inspiring acts of solidarity and courage can point the way to a better futureIn the introduction to a new, seasonal compilation of his speeches on hope, Pope Francis reflects on the legacy of the great German theologian Johann Baptist Metz. Shaped by the early experience of living through the horrors of the Nazi era, Metz’s political theology was a passionate warning against the danger of a self-absorbed Christian piety. Instead he urged a hopeful “mysticism with open eyes” – one that clear-sightedly bears witness to, and seeks to alleviate, the suffering of others.At a time of the year associated with renewal and new birth, it is not necessary to share Metz’s religious convictions to feel the power of that message. This year&nbsp;has been filled with heart-rending images from the&nbsp;ongoing wars in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and elsewhere. The weekend brought reports of yet more innocent casualties of Israel’s relentless bombing campaign, including children sheltering in a school. Meanwhile, more than 12,000 civilians have been killed&nbsp;since the start of Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine, along with more than 43,000 soldiers, according to Kyiv’s estimates.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For a decade I was an inspector of home education for two education authorities, and I became increasingly disturbed by the blatant – but legal – slackness of the recording that was required.Remarkably, I found that I had no legal authority to meet the children to monitor the provision of their education. Although most parents allowed me into their houses, a few merely provided me with work that their child had done – but I had no way of knowing its authenticity. I was overruled by one director of education when I wanted to investigate further. Even when I did meet the children, it was only once a year, and in most cases the level of education I found was pitiful. Two decades later, there is no evidence to suggest things have improved.

Dams and dikes are erected around the lake’s edges to protect against flooding. But this year, not for the first time, they were overwhelmed.For three days in early July, more than 800 rescue workers in Hunan province scrambled to block the breaches. One rupture alone took 100,000 cubic metres of rock to seal, according to Zhang Yingchun, a Hunan official. At least 7,000 people had to be evacuated. It was one of a series of disasters to hit China as the country grappled with a summer of extreme weather.

Most of us now know about livestock emissions, global deforestation in the name of producing feed, and the pollution – via agricultural runoff – of local waterways. A few years ago, we were told being sustainable meant avoiding dairy completely; then we learned about the benefits ruminants can bring to the soil when farmed regeneratively.The cheddar:

The Guardian,‘Still so relatable’: how teenage discovery of the Brontës fostered career in literature,"Lucy Powrie was 15 when she read Agnes Grey. Ten years on she is chair of the Brontë Parsonage MuseumLucy Powrie was 15 years old when she first read Anne Brontë’s 1847 novel Agnes Grey and instantly, intensely, fell in love. “There was just this moment of, I suppose, feeling like I’d come home. I’d found something that was just better than anything I had ever found in my life.”Already a wildly enthusiastic reader, she had been blogging about books since the age of 12, and hosting a book review channel on YouTube since she was 13. Discovering Anne Brontë, followed immediately by her older sisters Emily and Charlotte, opened the door to a new world: “They were everything that I didn’t realise was out there.” Continue reading...","Wed, 25 Dec 2024 09:00:06 GMT",0.0,0.9457
The Guardian,Katherine Parkinson on Rivals: ‘I’m just a normal 47-year-old woman who has breastfed two girls’,"Her dynamite romance with Danny Dyer in the raunchy Jilly Cooper hit is the living definition of screen chemistry. The actor opens up about booze, being sexual – and why the porn generation have got it all wrongIf Rivals wasn’t your standout show of 2024, so be it. It takes all sorts. But if it was, you’ll be in no doubt which was the truest, purest love story. Lizzie Vereker – the self-effacing erotica author, bullied by her husband – is supposed to be plain in the original text, but is played by the luminous Katherine Parkinson. Freddie – the rich but never greedy entrepreneur, bullied by his wife – is meant to be past his best, but is played with low-key, knowing magnetism by Danny Dyer. They are absolute dynamite together as they fall in love: sweet and romantic but also really hot, the living definition of screen chemistry.“It doesn’t have to be romantic chemistry,” says Parkinson, speaking to me from her home in London. “It’s just when you’re with an actor who’s similarly open, really up for the thrill of the ride. It’s thrilling when you’re in flow together. I’ve had anti-chemistry, too, and it’s been awful.” It’s especially peculiar when you’ve read Jilly Cooper’s book a load of times, and you know the A-couple is meant to be Rupert Campbell-Black (Alex Hassell) and Taggie O’Hara (Bella Maclean).

The Guardian,The Place of Tides by James Rebanks review – duck tales,"The Lakeland shepherd heads to a Norwegian island where eiderdown is harvested to learn lessons about nature and humanityIn his latest book, James Rebanks, the Lakeland shepherd turned bestselling author, sets off for the Arctic Circle in search of an elusive creature and an almost forgotten way of life. We find him in a rain-lashed house on a lonely island reading Moby-Dick. Is this a clever literary device? Are we in for a magnificent obsession and a baggy monster of a&nbsp;book that shouldn’t really work but somehow does? The perhaps surprising answer is: we are.Rebanks made his name with accounts of his love-hate relationship with farming: love of the land and the&nbsp;old ways practised by his grandad, a shepherd before him; hate for the mechanisation and pharmacology of&nbsp;Big Agriculture. His prose is deceptively unvarnished with flashes&nbsp;of colour: bright birds’ eggs in a&nbsp;well-found barn.

The Guardian,A Ghost Story for Christmas: Woman of Stone review – this E Nesbit tale definitely ain’t The Railway Children,"Mark Gatiss’s seventh festive horror tale is an adaptation of a short story by the children’s author – with added sisterhood and righteous vengeanceI have never understood the association of ghost stories with Christmas. Is it because it is still a part-pagan festival? Is it because we don’t like to let ourselves be too happy? Or is it because the whole family is likely to be home and you need to remind yourself that there could be more malevolent forces out there than in here, whatever the toxic dynamics? Perhaps it’s just because it gets dark so early.Whatever the reason, here is another half-hour shiver from Mark Gatiss, adapted this time not from the output of his beloved MR James, but from a more unexpected source. A Ghost Story for Christmas: Woman of Stone is based on a short story called Man-size in Marble by E Nesbit. Yes, that E Nesbit! The Railway Children E Nesbit! She was a prolific writer of novels and short stories, for adults as well as children; Man-size in Marble was published as part of her Grim Tales collection (for grownups) in 1893.

The Guardian,Twisters! Tennis! Transformations! The best movie moments of 2024,"From edge-of-seat chases to sexy role-playing, Guardian writers pick their most memorable scenes from films released in the US this yearSpoilers aheadAmy Adams’s canine transformation in Marielle Heller’s Nightbitch should be nothing we haven’t seen before. There is a fine history of moonlit metamorphoses in werewolf movies: moans that deepen into growls, the stretching and twisting of muscle, fur sprouting at lightning speed. In fact, some people criticised this film for shying away from the body horror at the heart of Mother’s animalistic breakdown. But there is a powerful whiff of catharsis in this low-key transformation scene: watching Adams sniff the midnight air, dig with bare hands into her own tidy suburban lawn, down on her paws, fully dog in body and mind, before the hair begins to bristle on her forearms. Adams’s eerily calm voiceover (“I have one thought: I am an animal”), follows the rippling fur as her character is reborn as a galloping red husky, with a cloud of strawberry-blond hair on a muscular frame. A hunting dog with a one-track mind: “Blood! Blood, blood, blood!” And it’s curtains for the neighbourhood cats. Pamela Hutchinson Continue reading...","Tue, 24 Dec 2024 12:00:41 GMT",0.7249,0.8143

The Guardian,Ripley to The Rings of Power: your top TV of 2024,"Who is a god of TV? Who has magical chemistry? And who deserves to be lightning-bolted for bad behaviour? Here are Guardian readers’ best shows of the year(Netflix) My favourite show of 2024. It seems to be a rarity in TV that a singular vision survives the creation by committee process. But in Ripley, Steven Zaillian gives us stylish black-and-white cinematography that’s usually reserved for the artiest of arthouse cinema. We get a meticulous mise-en-scene that makes every crime scene a puzzle for the viewer to dissect. And, most importantly, we get incredible central performances from Andrew Scott, Dakota Fanning and Johnny Flynn. This truly felt like a labour of love and for me surpasses both the source material and the previous film adaptation. For those eight hours, I was utterly transfixed. It also helps that for the first two episodes I didn’t realise I had subtitles turned off, so thought it was an intentional decision to avoid translating the Italian. It’s a testament to the quality of the show that I didn’t question that, and went with it. Harry Schofield, 30, London  Continue reading...","Tue, 24 Dec 2024 09:00:41 GMT",0.2023,0.9407
The Guardian,‘90 people have taken their own lives already. How many more do they want?’ The Labour peer taking on the scandal of ‘99-year’ sentences,"Indeterminate sentences were scrapped in 2012 – but thousands of prisoners are still serving them, often for petty crimes, with no hope of release. Could there now be hope of resentencing?Tony Woodley is raging at the injustice of it all. Enough is enough, says the Labour peer who has introduced a private member’s bill to resentence prisoners still serving time under imprisonment for public protection (IPP), which was abolished 12 years ago because it was regarded as an affront to decency. Although the sentence was banned, it wasn’t done so retrospectively, which means that almost 3,000 IPP prisoners are still inside, mostly for minor crimes, not knowing when, or if, they will ever be released.IPP is so horrific, Woodley says, that often people don’t believe him when he tells them about it. “If you said to somebody: ‘You’ve got 16 years in jail for stealing a plant pot’, they’d say: ‘You’re the bloody plant pot for saying that!’ People wouldn’t believe or didn’t want to believe some of the cases we’ve highlighted.” Continue reading...","Wed, 25 Dec 2024 08:00:05 GMT",-0.4019,-0.9942

The Guardian,The Christmas that went wrong: We went into last-minute lockdown – and I had to spend the big day with my ex,"Covid was everywhere, the fridge was empty and my former partner was coming to spend the day with me and my new girlfriend. Christmas was doomed … wasn’t it?The year was 2020 and Christmas itself hung in the balance. We had spent the last nine months in and out of Covid lockdowns. Initially, we had reacted with total diligence, united in fear and grief. But then we entered into an interminable hokey-cokey of being allowed out, then back in, then a bit out, then a bit in again. Obligatory scotch eggs was a particularly low point. By winter, the rules had become confusing and often felt&nbsp;unfollowable.Nevertheless, hope prevailed. We hadn’t seen our extended families for so long and the government promised that Christmas would not be cancelled. Christmas always feels a bit “high stakes”, even in normal times, but this one had been dialled up to 11. The extended absences from family meant we missed them all to bits. Also, my son was five – a peak age for enjoying yuletide business. I&nbsp;co-parent with my son’s dad (my&nbsp;ex) and, as luck would have it, it was my turn to have my son on Christmas Day. We were going to stay with my parents in Dorset and it felt like it had to be a good one. Continue reading...","Wed, 25 Dec 2024 05:00:02 GMT",-0.4767,0.8823
The Guardian,"‘This book is my bible!’ The women who read Miranda July’s All Fours, then blew up their lives","The wildly acclaimed novel about a perimenopausal woman going on a journey of erotic awakening has left a wave of women following in the protagonist’s wake‘I don’t read books that literally,” says Abra, 49, from Arizona. “I&nbsp;don’t read literature as self-help.” But we’re talking about All Fours, the second novel by the American artist and author Miranda July, which came out this year, and the way it changed her life. The New York Times called it “the first great perimenopause novel” and “the talk of every group text”, having started “a whisper network of women fantasising about desire and freedom”. This is a novel that made women blow up their lives; every book group had a friend of a friend whose life had been shaken to its foundations.If you’ve not read the book, the plot can be summarised thus: an artist – wife to a Good Guy, mother to an under-10 – sets off on a road trip and gets distracted by a dancer. She moves into a motel room to stay near him, and remodels it in sumptuous fabrics. She can’t sleep, can’t think, definitely can’t go home, maddened with longing. The libidinous intensity of what’s later floated as a perimenopause effect is magical. I’d never seen that on a page before. Continue reading...","Tue, 24 Dec 2024 08:00:39 GMT",0.0,0.9835
