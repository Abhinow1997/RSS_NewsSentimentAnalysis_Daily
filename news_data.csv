The Guardian,‘We can barely believe what’s happening’: how Syria’s frozen conflict flared into hot war that could topple Assad,"With insurgents closing in on Damscus, questions remain over whether the Assad regime will dig in, and if Hayat Tahrir al-Sham are as moderate as they seemWhen Islamist militants swept into her home town of Aleppo little over a week ago, Rama Alhalabi sheltered indoors as fear engulfed her. Forces loyal to president Bashar al-Assad, who had sought to reassure residents that nothing was happening, suddenly deserted the city. But as the insurgency pushed south, rapidly seizing control of the city of Hama on the road to Damascus, Alhalabi’s fears about life under militia rule have slowly ebbed. Instead they have been replaced by fears that her friends in the army will be abandoned by their commanding officers as Assad’s regime loses its grip.“People in Aleppo are feeling more comfortable now we’re further from the areas under the regime’s control,” said the 29-year-old, while still using a pseudonym in fear Assad could retake the city.

Our own Rylan Clark, the nonpareil of reality TV stars, Essex boy and the nation’s guncle (“gay uncle” for those of you who couldn’t place the vibe though you were warmed by it nonetheless) is brought into the orbit of the greatest star in the seasonal firmament, Mariah Carey; she of the five-octave voice, multiple music awards, feted singer and songwriter, seller of 220m records and counting and all-round extraordinary talent.Rylan is thrilled. Mariah is … less so. They sit opposite each other in remarkably cheap-looking cream boucle armchairs for a notional fireside chat to mark the 30th anniversary of her mega hit All I Want for Christmas Is You. He is energetic, funny – even witty when he gets a chance – and clearly a genuine devotee. She is … none of these things. Mariah sits – regally, do I need to say? – on one of the cheap chairs, a blank-faced queen ready to receive her due from a subject, but so ungraciously that it rapidly becomes dreadful to watch.

The Guardian,I’ve never been keen on turkey. Now my aversion is approaching outright loathing | Rachel Cooke,"The Christmas bird has now been financially weaponisedI’m calling this column “Turkey, Revisited”, after “Toads, Revisited” by Philip Larkin, a poet who was most definitely not a gourmand (“I was too lazy to buy rations in London, so today has been a poached egg, macaroni &amp; tinned spinach”). Some years ago, you see, I wrote about my dislike of the bird in one of these columns, a piece that continues occasionally to reverberate in the form of messages from readers. Riffing on an essay by the great American food writer Jeffrey Steingarten, who once tried a legendary turkey recipe whose stuffing has 32 ingredients, the piece in question detailed my adventures with a Kelly Bronze I’d mortgaged my house to buy: the baroque trumpets that played as it entered the kitchen; the spa treatments I administered to its skin; the tea towel of finest cashmere that covered it before it was carved. It also came to the conclusion that, in spite of all of the above, I had completely wasted my time. The result was … about 3kg of OK.So why return to the subject? No, I haven’t seen the light. In fact, my aversion has since become close to outright loathing. In part, this has to do with my nature. I seem to have made up my mind about turkey, in the same way that I’ve made up my mind about Nadine Dorries and Jacob Rees-Mogg (this lady is not for turning, unless we’re talking about a spit with a nice bit of pork or lamb on it). I think also that I’ve grown more green down the years, and turkey is almost inevitably wasteful, no matter how many recipes for leftover korma one dutifully reads.

It was three years ago, during the pandemic, and the call was from Gareth Neame, CEO of Carnival Films, who asked if I would consider adapting Frederick Forsyth’s iconic 1971 novel The Day of the Jackal for longform television. It wouldn’t be a remake, he stressed, but a contemporary reimagining.I was flattered by the approach and that night sat down to rewatch Fred Zinnemann’s brilliant 1973 film adaptation. But when considering any offer, I always ask myself four things: is it interesting, does it feel substantial, is it a project I can bring something to? Then, will I get on with the producers?

One of them, from the much-admired chef Shaun Rankin, is entitled the Taste of Home menu. It’s an interesting title, because it acknowledges something: that despite our growing comfort with paying others to cook for us, choosing to eat out on 25 December is still regarded as subversive and decadent. Christmas dinner is the one remaining domestic feast. It’s the one day of the year when we strap ourselves to the stove and cook a complex multistage meal, packed full of adored convention and cliche. And yet amazingly, some people choose to get out the credit card and leave the house.So what is Rankin’s taste of home? It starts with sourdough, cultured butters and beef tea, continues through “scallop, celeriac, pine”, and ends with a tarte tatin and mince pies. In between, there’s the comforting sound of “traditional roast Norfolk Bronze turkey”, though as the butter is clearly more cultured than I am and the scallop comes with pine, who knows what that means. If you want to taste Mr Rankin’s home it will cost you £275 a head. Roll your eyes all you like, but remember there are people giving up their Christmas Day to cook this. It should cost.

The Guardian,We Tories have lost the professional classes to Labour. Here’s how to win them back | Paul Goodman,"In the past 50 years, Britain has changed and so have the voters the party once relied on. To survive, the Conservatives must adaptPaul Goodman is a senior fellow at Policy ExchangeIn this year’s general election, 19% of graduates voted Conservative, only three percentage points more than voted Liberal Democrat; 43% voted Labour. You might expect such a finding after a contest in which the Tories crashed to their lowest-ever number of Commons seats. But the contrast with non-graduates is striking. The Conservatives gained a bigger share than any of their competitors among those with other types of qualifications – 32% to Labour’s 30%. Among those with no qualifications at all, their lead was bigger: they took 39% and Labour 28%.Look back five years to a very different election – Boris Johnson’s crushing 2019 victory – and the pattern is much the same. The Tories may have won that poll, but they lost among graduates, with 34% to Labour’s 39%. And in the general election of 2017, Labour’s lead among them was 15 points. The tale of the Conservatives’ downturn among graduates last year is part of a longer decline.Lord Goodman of Wycombe is a senior fellow at Policy Exchange Continue reading...","Sat, 07 Dec 2024 08:00:19 GMT",0.3612,0.3506
The Guardian,Labour’s must help disadvantaged children become ‘school ready’ before it’s too late | Editorial,"With child poverty forecast to rise by 400,000, Keir Starmer’s pledge to improve the life chances of early learners is a matter of the utmost urgencyA third of children starting school in England aged five are not “school ready”. For children from disadvantaged backgrounds, that figure is much higher – just under half of children eligible for free school meals enter the classroom not having met the level of development expected for their age. This gap could not be more important: children who start school already behind are more likely to fall further behind and to disengage&nbsp;from their education as they get older.Until now, the government has had too little to say on ensuring more children start school with healthy levels of development; as we have previously argued, it has been a conspicuously missing element of&nbsp;the government’s mission to break down barriers to opportunity. So it is very welcome that Keir Starmer last week included a specific target to improve school readiness – the prime minister has&nbsp;pledged to increase the numbers&nbsp;of children who are school ready from two-thirds to three-quarters by the end of this parliament – as part of Labour’s new “plan for change” milestones.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Horrible Histories: laughing to learn | Editorial,"Silly, subversive and scatological, the show has transformed children’s TV. It deserves its special Bafta award“It must be horrible, funny and true,” the writer Terry Deary said of adapting his multimillion-selling children’s books series Horrible Histories for TV. First aired on CBBC in 2009, the show is now into its 11th series. With nine children’s Baftas and two British comedy awards under its belt, last week it added a Bafta special award – the only children’s show to win&nbsp;one to date. The International Prix Jeunesse&nbsp;named it the best non-fiction children’s show&nbsp;of the last 50 years.Silly, subversive and obsessively scatological, Horrible Histories is more successful than an educational comedy sketch show for kids deserves to be. An unholy mix of Blackadder and Monty Python, it has transformed children’s television.

The Guardian,"‘Gun control is dead, and we killed it’: the growing threat of firearms that can be made at home","One far-right cell wanted to use 3D-printed guns to cause ‘maximum confusion and fear’ on the streets of Finland. Could the police intercept them in time?Long before he started making guns with a 3D printer, Viljam Nyman was a kid who was bullied. In a document police later found on his computer, titled “The life story of how I became a far-right extremist”, Nyman described his childhood in Lahti, a city in southern Finland, being picked on by other kids and feeling abandoned by the adults around him. He wrote that this experience taught him something: “‘Be yourself’ or ‘don’t care’ were really bad pieces of advice. Violence and power, or the threat of using it, were actually the things that mattered. Equality and accepting difference were just words on paper, naive and idealistic fantasies. Human nature, in reality, was discriminatory and racist.”In 2005, when Nyman was 11, violent protests broke out in a number of European countries after a Danish newspaper published 12 cartoons of the prophet Muhammad in response to a debate about Islam and self-censorship. Why was it, Nyman wondered, that he was mocked for being different and no one did anything about it, but criticising a religion from faraway countries was off limits? He wrote in the document that “all of this” reinforced his belief that something was wrong with society and no one was on his side. Nyman became obsessed with Hitler and Nazi Germany. He began with the notion that bullies could be classified as subhuman and sent to camps, but became fascinated by the discipline and order of the Third Reich. As he got older, he immersed himself in online message boards that shared antisemitic theories. Until this point, Nyman had spent a lot of time playing video games. Now, he thought, he needed to do more so that he would not be a disgrace to the white race. He started to feel something he had not felt before: a sense of purpose.

The Guardian,"‘The vibe may be British, but the money is not’: how the US quietly conquered UK TV","That new British show you love? There’s a fair chance it is being backed by a US studio. What’s behind the Americans’ sudden influence over our TV – and will it mean more Ted Lassos, and fewer Only Fools and Horses?My favourite TV show of 2024 couldn’t be any more British if it tried. Set in a City investment bank violently buffeted by an omnishambolic treasury, soundtracked by wry, maudlin 1980s UK synthpop (Simple Minds, Pet Shop Boys) and featuring a character named Sir Henry Muck, Industry scans British society, from strip clubs and tabloids to private members’ establishments and country piles. Every second pulses with a lightly worn, razor-sharp fluency in British class and culture that can only be the product of a lifetime studying its dynamics. But the funny thing is, Industry isn’t really British at all.Perhaps that’s a bit harsh. After all, Industry is – obviously – filmed here in the UK, has a predominantly British cast and is written by two Britons; erstwhile City boys Konrad Kay and Mickey Down. Yet this is a TV series that is essentially made by and for the US: Industry has two prominent American actors in its ensemble, premieres in the States and is funded by HBO, the network that almost single-handedly created prestige TV in the early 00s. The vibe may be British, but the money is not. Continue reading...","Sat, 07 Dec 2024 11:55:23 GMT",0.0,0.7221

A moment later, the deputy editor asks where I’m off to. To see Brian Cox, the actor, I say. “Oh!” she says, with a rather-you-than-me look. “Hope he’s not too grumpy!”Cox has played grumpy for going on 60 years. All sorts of grumpiness – idiot grumpy (independent candidate Bob Servant in the TV comedy of the same name), world-weary grumpy (school principal Dr Nelson Guggenheim in Wes Anderson’s film Rushmore), psychopathic grumpy (the first movie incarnation of Hannibal Lecter in Manhunter), egomaniacal grumpy (Robert McKee in Spike Jonze’s Adaptation) and, of course, brutal grumpy as media mogul Logan Roy in the TV series Succession. In recent years, he has often appeared on chatshows being grumpy about the state of the world. In 2022, he published his hugely entertaining memoirs, in which he was grumpy about method acting, useless directors, vain thesps, useless politicians, the church, capitalism, cancel culture, you name it. He was also fabulously indiscreet – Steven Seagal, whom he worked with on The Glimmer Man, is “as ludicrous in real life as he appears on screen”, Johnny Depp is “so overblown, so overrated”, Tarantino’s work is “meretricious”, Edward Norton is “a nice lad, but a bit of a pain in the arse because he fancies himself as a writer-director”, while Michael Caton-Jones, who directed him in Rob Roy, is a “complete arsehole”.

Twenty-five years ago, you had a CV and, if you wanted a new job, you updated it and sent it to prospective employers. Your reputation may have enhanced your prospects but, when it came to job hunting, your qualifications and CV were pretty much the only showcase you had.With the internet everything changed – and then changed again with social media and smartphones. Suddenly, you were visible to millions of people on a device they carried around in their pockets. Those same tools gave you the ability to step up from CVs to slickly presented websites and slide decks.

The Guardian,Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall: ‘I’ve never thought of myself as eccentric.

It must have come out in the early 1970s and I basically became the pastry chef for my mum’s dinner parties. I made chocolate mousses, chocolate rum gateaux, profiteroles, eclairs and genoise sponge in the summer with three, or even four, layers of cream, raspberries and cake. But it wasn’t Bake Off: I didn’t try and make it look like Vesuvius or something.I learned early on that it’s not a brilliant idea to name all the animals you’re planning to eat. On the whole you name the breeding stock but not the fat stock; so the sows and the nannies and the cows have names, but not the ones who are passing through, you might say, a little faster. I did call my first two pigs Charlie and Tom, after two of my best friends, and it didn’t make it any easier to take them to the slaughterhouse.

The Guardian,"In the frame: hotels, tattoos and family with Vanessa Branson","Art, sculpture and inspired colour palettes turn a home into the story of a lifeVanessa Branson lives in a mews house set back from a cobbled street. At one end is an old synagogue, at the other a Greek Orthodox cathedral, and beyond the little courtyard is a home that, as soon as you enter, feels like the most comfortable art gallery in the world. For all its rickety glamour, this house is significantly smaller than Branson’s previous home, a large townhouse in west London. “I have four kids who were all living with me with their partners, and then I had a friend who moved in for a long weekend and stayed for 32 years – there were 10 of us in the house,” she says, merrily adding that selling it was the only way to get them all to leave.While her brother Richard was launching Virgin Records, in 1986 Branson opened a small contemporary art gallery in London’s Portobello Road. She was 23, and it was a time, she says, when art meant “sporting prints” for collectors’ walls. “It was quite a risky thing to do to buy something contemporary, but I realised that by buying a young artist’s work you’re encouraging them to push on. I didn’t have much cash, but I started to buy works myself, and it’s been a fabulous part of my life.” Continue reading...","Sat, 07 Dec 2024 16:00:28 GMT",0.0,0.9602

Serena Smith meets the collectors seeking yesteryear’s glamourDeep into my nightly TikTok scroll, I stumbled across the world of vintage makeup. I had discovered a video of creator Olivia White (@LivvyLoveASMR) roleplaying as a softly spoken Avon lady selling her wares in a soothing ASMR video, tapping her nails on kitschy old cosmetic bottles shaped like pieces of dollhouse furniture. I was rapt, intrigued by the novelty packaging that stood in stark contrast to the sort of staid, samey makeup products that populate shelves today. “When I first started making these videos I had no idea people would like them so much,” says White, 27. “I think there’s an element of nostalgia to it all. A lot of people leave comments saying my videos remind them of their grandmothers. It makes my heart so full to read that.” White herself inherited most of her collection from her own grandmother and great-grandmother, who were both Avon sales representatives in the 1960s and 1970s.A love of history is also what keeps Lisa Larsson, 61, hooked on collecting vintage cosmetics. In 1975, when she was 12, a family friend gifted her a 1930s minaudière – a small, beautifully decorated case divided into storage compartments. “It was a double-sided gilt brass case with a metal mesh strap handle, decorated with green faux-shagreen enamel,” she recalls. “The interior on one side had a bevelled mirror, a small plastic comb and compartments for powder and rouge. The other side had clips for a matchbook and stamps, a section for cigarettes, and a small compartment for hairpins. I loved it.” Continue reading...","Sat, 07 Dec 2024 13:00:24 GMT",0.5859,0.9814

The Guardian,How Russia is winning the arms race in Ukraine – video,"Russia is engaging in a 'shadow war' with Nato states, which is reportedly part of a deliberate strategy to undermine the alliance’s ability to support Ukraine. At the same time Russia's military industrial complex is producing arms at a formidable rate, and with Nato countries struggling to keep up in term of numbers, the arms race is having a big impact on the frontline.

The Guardian,How having babies became so political - video,"The pronatalist movement in the US is gathering pace once again, rekindled by Silicon Valley personalities and hard-right conservatives who are becoming increasingly vocal about whether or not women are having enough babies. But it's not just in the US, some governments in other countries have launched marketing campaigns encouraging people to have more children, while others have offered financial incentives. But while many of these policies claim to be about halting population decline, there are other factors at play. Josh Toussaint-Strauss interrogates efforts around the world to boost birth rates, as well as the underlying political motivations, from bodily autonomy to immigrationBirthrates are plummeting worldwide. Can governments turn the tide?When desperate measures to persuade women to have children fail, it’s time for fresh thinking Continue reading...","Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:33:44 GMT",0.0,0.9161

The Guardian,"Glam it up, guys: partywear for men – in pictures","You can always rely on monochrome for an event look, but texture keeps it interestingWe’re a week into December and the party season is in full swing. If you’re struggling with the age old ‘what to wear’ conundrum, keep it simple. Stick with black and white and experiment with texture, it’s a versatile way to supercharge your outfit. Dolce and Gabbana’s AW24 collection is a master class in how to nail the look. Aim for contrasting textures to layer up: silk under wool, or velvet with lace adds a modern edge to the party look. Look for black-on-black embellishment for a timeless look you can wheel out every year. Reiss’s black sequin shirt (4) adds flair without being out-and-out showy, style with black trousers and loafers. Next’s subtle glitter tuxedo (8) is another affordable take on the look. For more adventurous dressers, one of the key runway trends was sheer – from full-on chest revealing transparency to more wearable gauzy shirts, like Allsaints lace one (£119) and River Island’s white lace (£46, main image above).If embellishment is too seasonal look for interesting detailing, like Represent’s zip-up jacket (2) that will look sharp long after the last champagne cork has popped on NYE . Ditto Zara’s tailored separates and Daily Paper’s chess board patterned pieces, style with a gauzy shirt for a night out, but swap in a sweater for spring. For more formal events, velvet blazers always look super chic over a fine-gauge black rollneck. Continue reading...","Sat, 07 Dec 2024 23:50:37 GMT",0.0,0.9814

The academic, who teaches at Falmouth University in Cornwall, has now travelled to the north pole 12 times, and this photo was taken in 2018, “high in the Arctic Ocean, north of the Franz Josef Land archipelago, in the frozen pack ice”.The polar bear Lewis-Jones captured with his iPhone 7 was searching for seals, which haul themselves out on to the floe or come up in the breathing holes.
