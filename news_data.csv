The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Nato lauds Blinken on final Brussels turn,"US secretary of state arrives with another $725m in US arms for Ukraine; Russia complains of Ukrainian help to Syria rebels. What we know on day 1,015Antony Blinken, the outgoing US secretary of state, paid his final visit to Nato headquarters in Brussels on Tuesday promising Joe Biden’s administration would keep seeking to funnel arms to Ukraine in the little time it has left in power. “This is a vital moment for the alliance to make sure we’re level set for the year ahead,” Blinken said. “Like it or not, you’ve got me and you’ve got us until the 20th of January, every minute, every day.” Donald Trump, soon to be president, has cast doubt on maintaining US support and vowed to cut a quick deal to end the war. The Nato head, Mark Rutte, told Blinken: “We wish you the best after January, but we need you until 20 January, every day, and we know we can count on you … You have been a staunch ally and people like you very much.”It comes as the Biden administration rushes another $725m worth of military equipment to Ukraine in a last-ditch effort to shore up its defences against Russia invasion before Donald Trump assumes the US presidency. Andrew Roth writes from Washington that it includes Stinger anti-air missiles, anti-drone weapons, artillery shells and long-range Himars rocket munitions, and anti-armour missiles, as well as spare parts and other assistance to repair damaged equipment from US stocks.Ukraine insisted on Tuesday that Nato membership was the only “real guarantee” for its security, but foreign ministers from the alliance sidestepped Kyiv’s push for an invitation ahead of Trump’s return to the US presidency. A dinner of foreign ministers from Ukraine and the alliance’s 32 member states ended without any concrete decision. “There was no progress,” said Lithuania’s Gabrielius Landsbergis.Russia’s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, on Tuesday accused Ukrainian intelligence services of aiding rebels fighting the Kremlin-backed Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad, saying some fighters were “openly flaunting” the association. “Ukrainian military instructors from the GUR are present … training HTS fighters for combat operations,” including against Russian troops in Syria, Nebenzia alleged. There have previously been claims of Ukrainian military specialists humiliating the Kremlin in Mali and Sudan by helping local forces to inflict defeats on Russia’s Wagner mercenaries.Ukraine’s foreign ministry said on Monday that Russia and Iran “bear the main responsibility” for the recent escalation in fighting in Syria. Kyiv hit out at Assad for recognising Moscow’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, and said Ukrainians were also being targeted on a nightly basis by Iranian-designed drones. “The Russian dictator Putin and his allies in Iran continue to make every effort not to lose control over the puppet Syrian regime, which is associated by the majority of Syrians with inhuman cruelty, tyranny and crimes.”Russian presidential aircraft and funds were used in a programme that took children from occupied Ukrainian territories, stripped them of Ukrainian identity and placed them with Russian families, according to a report by Yale’s School of Public Health. The US state department-backed research, published on Tuesday, identified 314 Ukrainian children taken to Russia in the early months of the war in Ukraine as part of what it says was a systematic, Kremlin-funded programme to “Russify” them. In March 2023, the international criminal court issued arrest warrants for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his child rights’ commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, for the alleged war crime of deportation of Ukrainian children.

He knew his client Gisèle Pelicot had to be told details of the hundreds of rapes her husband had subjected her to while she was unconscious over the course of almost a decade, but how could he possibly do so without causing her even more harm?By 2022, when Babonneau took the case, Gisèle knew that her husband, Dominique, had drugged her and invited strangers he met online into their home to assault her, but she had no idea of the specifics. Babonneau would find out after watching many of the 20,000 videos and photographs Gisèle’s husband had made over the years. “Everyone was extremely worried she could have a nervous breakdown,” Babonneau says. “What would happen when she was faced with the full truth and scale of what was done to her?” Continue reading...","Tue, 03 Dec 2024 23:59:07 GMT",-0.2755,-0.9652
The Guardian,A moment that changed me: I felt alone in my misery – but catching a fish gave me hope,"I had long resisted spending days in the cold and wet of north-east Scotland. Then I realised it offered the peace and quiet I needed mostIn August 2020, a doctor said two words to me that have rattled around in my head ever since: “bipolar” and “disorder”. I was lucky. I wasn’t sectioned and no one, except me, had really been concerned about my behaviour. The doctor didn’t seem too worried, so neither was I. Off I&nbsp;went, unmedicated, with a sense of&nbsp;relief at having the great mystery of my mental health revealed.For the next eight months, I&nbsp;persevered in my job and with a&nbsp;relationship that left me a guilt-ridden, anxious, isolated mess. By May 2021, my family decided it was time to evacuate me from London for a week of fishing on the River Findhorn in north-east Scotland. For years, they had dragged me along on fishing trips until I was old enough to resist. This meant days of tangled lines, grey skies, wind, rain, mud and tears. It meant sitting on the bank, cold and bored, being handed rods to reel in fish, struggling to cast. Continue reading...","Tue, 03 Dec 2024 23:59:07 GMT",0.25,-0.5574
The Guardian,Are chicken sandwiches a) a tasty lunch? Or b) the ultimate symbol of gen Z wokeness? | Arwa Mahdawi,"Those waging a war on woke have turned their attentions to twentysomethings’ supposed rejection of ham and mustard sarnies. Clearly this is what people mean by bread and butter issues ...You are what you eat. And if you eat sandwiches? Then you’re probably woke, I’m afraid. While the convenience food may have been invented by a degenerate earl who, legend has it, didn’t want a proper meal to interrupt his gambling, some sarnies have now been deemed politically correct by the MailOnline – who are, of course, leading experts in wokeness. The MailOnline is getting flak for a recent headline that states gen Z “are ditching English classics like ham and mustard in favour of fancy woke fillings”.What sort of PC fillings are we talking about? Quinoa, vegan camembert and kale on artisanal sourdough with a non-binary condiment (they-onnaise)? Nope. It seems what has ruffled the MailOnline’s feathers is … chicken. According to The Great British Sandwich Study, a wholesome survey conducted by the bread maker Allinson’s, older generations are partial to a ham sandwich while gen Z prefer chicken. Most boomers also like cheddar while younger consumers are fond of fancier fillings. Pretty inoffensive stuff, right? Yet somehow this has been packaged up into a culture wars piece. It’s funny how conservatives love to accuse the left of being snowflakes, yet they’re the ones getting upset by a sandwich. Continue reading...","Tue, 03 Dec 2024 23:59:05 GMT",0.0,0.9122

But why the pumping electro soundtrack?Unless you’re particularly interested in cults – and French cults at that – there’s a strong possibility that you’ve yet to come across the Order of the Solar Temple. For the uninitiated, the OTS was a religious cult active from the mid-1980s to the mid-90s, basing its teachings on a grab bag that included new age fluff, Freemasonry and ideas pilfered from the Knights Templar. Its founders – jeweller turned spiritual guru Joseph Di Mambro and a charismatic homeopath named Luc Jouret – succeeded in recruiting several hundred members across Switzerland, France, Canada and even a handful on the French Caribbean island of Martinique.In its promo videos, the OTS steered away from bells and smells to promote its ecological credentials, with members living off the land in its technicolour communes. But there was a catch. Like many cults before and since, the Order used its members for free labour and to gain access to their life savings, promising them eternal life if – and only if – they took their own lives in order to ascend to a planet called Sirius. More chilling still, the sect simply murdered many of those who didn’t kill themselves voluntarily. In total, 74 followers died between 1994 and 1997, including Jouret and Di Mambro themselves.

I was washing my body every day, so I figured I should shampoo my hair daily too. Then, in my teens, a classmate with hair much thicker and more lustrous than mine told me shampoo was terrible – it strips your strands, she claimed, leaving your hair parched and fragile. Shampoo as little as possible, she advised. She herself only did it once a week.I tried this for a couple of horrible months.

And so it might prove to be with Liza Minnelli. Earlier this year, Minnelli announced that she is writing what is sure to be a blockbuster memoir. The book promises to pull no punches which – when you factor in her parents, her addiction issues and her complicated love life – is a hell of a lot of punches not to pull.The book isn’t due to come out until 2026. Despite this, the television rights have already been optioned and, even though it’s so far in the distance, Minnelli has already got several ideas about casting. In an email to People magazine, she wrote: “First, we need a great script and an actress who loves to move,” adding, “Honey, first, I’m a dancer … like the great line in Chorus Line: God, I’m a dancer … a dancer dances … even with replaced hips and scoliosis!” Continue reading...","Tue, 03 Dec 2024 16:09:46 GMT",0.34,0.9836
The Guardian,"So Labour waded into the Gregg Wallace row. Why don’t they get their own house, parliament, in order? | Marina Hyde","Westminster is so notorious for bad workplace behaviour it’s known as ‘Pestminster’, but politicians seem more worried about a TV cooking showWhy has the prime minister weighed in on the content of a Gregg Wallace Instagram video? News that Keir Starmer’s spokesperson has taken the trouble to denounce the outer monologue of the beleaguered MasterChef host means – somewhat amazingly – that Gregg has no longer said the stupidest thing this week. This is, after all, supposed to be the week of Starmer’s big reset. Pivoting to rent-a-quote somehow does not feel like the solution that a malfunctioning UK requires.Perhaps Starmer thought it would make him more popular? He is polling at a minus 33% approval rating with the British public, which I would have thought was actually rather lower than Gregg Wallace. Perhaps this is why the No 10 spokesperson felt – wrongly – that it might be the business of a prime minister to have a view on reporters’ questions about what he felt about someone blowing up their career on Insta at 7am on a Sunday. Reporters will always ask these questions, especially on slow news days, but experience shows that there is absolutely no expectation to answer them, let alone a requirement. Wallace has since declared he “wasn’t in a good head space” when he posted the video. One can’t help feeling the PM’s spokesperson should do the same.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"After months of dysfunction and miscommunication, is the Starmer method finally working? | Rafael Behr","The prime minister won’t learn charisma, but he has a record of going places by doggedly clearing the obstacles in his wayIf Rishi Sunak had clung to power until the very end of the five-year term that Boris Johnson won in 2019, he would still be prime minister today. He had until 28 January next year to hold the election. The equivalent deadline for Keir Starmer is 21 August 2029. That is a horizon beyond the reach of reliable political forecasting, even if the second half of this decade turns out less volatile than the first. More turbulence seems likelier.But Labour’s majority is much bigger than the one Sunak lost and Starmer’s character contains none of the traits that made Johnson such a wellspring of chaos.

What we gave him will last generations | Ranjana Srivastava","My father was more thrilled with his present than the times we gave him lovely photos, swanky dinners and a fancy laptopI waited until I was 15 years old to have my first major disagreement with my physicist dad. We were living in India, and I had just been elected (note, not appointed) captain of my high school. Shortly before I “assumed office”, he was offered a coveted position at an American university. My teenage self was incredulous that he would put his career over my popularity.My pleas to stay back at boarding school were to no avail. My father made no effort to reassure me that the massive geographical and cultural shift would work out. Instead, he said we were sailing uncharted waters and would have to make the best of our situation. So off we went to freezing Minneapolis where we spent a year before my dad’s reputed lab was invited to move to Pittsburgh. My exasperation was complete.

The Guardian,Cop29 gave us a Putin-friendly deal – and a glimpse of the dark future of climate talks | Fiona Harvey,"The Baku Cop29 talks were marked by division and self-interest, with rancorous meddling right until the endFiona Harvey is an environment editor at the GuardianWhen I first visited Azerbaijan this spring, one fixture of the Baku skyline was unmissable. The bright orange of flaring – the product of the oil and gas extraction that makes up 90% of Azerbaijan’s export revenues – lit up the night sky, not far from the Olympic stadium, where nearly 200 nations would gather in November for the Cop29 climate summit.Flaring burns methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, and is a major source of carbon emissions. If all the world’s flared gas were captured instead, it could power sub-Saharan Africa. But that entails installing new equipment, so producers don’t bother.Fiona Harvey is an environment editor at the Guardian Continue reading...","Tue, 03 Dec 2024 15:55:31 GMT",0.0,0.431
The Guardian,Musk’s legal battle for his $56bn goes on. Tesla’s board still looks supine | Nils Pratley,"The craven stance of Tesla’s board should not be lost in the legal back-and-forthThe first time around, judge Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware court of chancery got it right. The $56bn pay package awarded by Tesla to Elon Musk in 2018 was indeed a governance abomination, a stitch-up in which ordinary shareholders weren’t told about the “deeply flawed” process whereby a “superstar ceo” secured wildly over-the-top terms from pliant directors.Her closely argued ruling in January spelt it out in persuasive detail. The company had “inaccurately described key directors as independent and misleadingly omitted details about the process”. Ira Ehrenpreis, the lead director negotiating for Tesla, had a 15-year business relationship with Musk. Another member of the working group regularly went on holiday with Musk’s family. A third was the company’s general counsel and Musk’s former divorce lawyer. Continue reading...","Tue, 03 Dec 2024 18:54:00 GMT",-0.2732,0.7692
The Guardian,The Guardian view on protests in Georgia: resisting a drift into Putin’s orbit | Editorial,"The Georgian Dream government’s suspension of EU talks has sparked an existential struggle for democracyIn recent years, Georgia’s ruling Georgian Dream (GD) party has brazenly pursued a policy of gaslighting an overwhelmingly pro-European population. Rhetorically, it has paid enthusiastic lip service to the national goal of eventual accession to the European Union, an aim that is enshrined in the constitution. In practice, a party founded by the billionaire oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili – whose wealth was accumulated in&nbsp;Russia – has been pulling Georgia ever further into the authoritarian orbit of Vladimir Putin.“Foreign agent” legislation passed earlier this year – provoking large protests in Tbilisi – copied and pasted Russian laws designed to curtail the influence of independent civil society organisations. Subsequent restrictions placed on LGBTQ+ rights came from the same playbook. Having awarded EU candidate status to Georgia in 2023, these illiberal moves led Brussels to belatedly conclude that it was being taken for a ride by Mr Ivanishvili’s political placemen. Membership talks were accordingly paused in June. Nevertheless, in the lead-up to an election this October, GD politicians were still pledging their commitment to EU membership.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on social care: reformers must reclaim the initiative | Editorial,"Labour pledged ‘deep reform’ of this flawed and complex system. A royal commission could shape a consensusThe sooner the government brings forward social care proposals the better. The lack of further detail about a manifesto commitment to “deep reform” has been a disappointment of Labour’s first months in office. Assisted dying and palliative care are a largely separate issue, relating to the last six months of life rather than the long-term (and sometimes lifelong) needs that social care addresses. But following last week’s vote on Kim Leadbeater’s bill, social care reformers need to reclaim the initiative.The rising need for social care in an ageing population is widely recognised to be among the UK’s biggest public policy challenges (while it is devolved, the four administrations confront many of the same difficulties). But that hasn’t stopped repeated delays to policies to address it. A royal commission would be one route out of the impasse. Unless he has identified another one, Wes Streeting should take it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters from David Diprose and Maureen TilfordJohn Harris raises some important issues in his article (Labour’s big relaunch won’t solve its biggest problem: this government doesn’t speak human, 1 December), but it’s crucial to dig deeper into the relationship between politics and emotion. Politicians like Donald Trump and Nigel Farage are not more “human” than those in the centre or on the left. They just know how to manipulate dark human emotions – fear, anger and resentment – in societies where there is profound inequality, very little taxation of the rich and barely regulated privatisation of all that makes civilised life possible – health services, education, water,&nbsp;energy and transport.They particularly know how to manipulate resentment – the emotion that underlies fascism – when so many people struggle for survival as they watch the smug satisfaction of those who don’t.

The Guardian,Chargers are key to the electric vehicle transition | Letters,"Stephen Smith says people won’t buy EVs until they can easily access the energy needed to drive them. Raj Parkash thinks every car should be charged using the same mechanismGaby Hinsliff’s article (Starmer has discovered a tricky truth about the electric vehicles transition: there’s no gain without pain, 29 November) doesn’t address the key point in the analysis of car companies’ difficulties in selling enough electric vehicles (EVs). There is a lack of demand that is only partly due to the higher prices. More importantly, it is due to a failure to install the necessary infrastructure to enable mass charging.A minority of car owners live in houses where home charging is possible. For the rest, to make EVs a possibility, never mind attractive, there need to be a huge number of charging points to accommodate millions of people. I live in a city with a very high density of tenement and other flats; at the moment there are virtually no charging points easily accessible for flat owners. In such areas, where it is not possible to install a charger in your home, it is simply not possible to run an EV. Continue reading...","Tue, 03 Dec 2024 17:56:56 GMT",0.0,-0.2469
The Guardian,Van Nistelrooy's effect on Leicester highlights depth of Lopetegui's plight | Ben Fisher,"New manager’s instant connection with fans stood in stark contrast to the forlorn, isolated figure in West Ham’s dugoutNinety-eight seconds. That was all that was required for Ruud van Nistelrooy’s Leicester City reign to get up and running. Jamie Vardy’s opener offered an early snapshot of Leicester in Van Nistelrooy’s image, too. Victor Kristiansen, hugging the left touchline, squared the ball to Bilal El Khannouss, who freed Leicester’s No 9, head down, open for business in the left channel. Vardy, wearing garish pink boots, stroked a timeless right-foot finish into the far corner.After a VAR check, he clinked into celebration mode, chuntering towards the away fans giving him grief. Even before Patson Daka made it 3-0 with stoppage time looming, the same supporters switched their attention to their manager. “You’re getting sacked in the morning,” came the chant. Julen Lopetegui, ashen-faced at the final whistle, will do well to survive this grisly defeat. Lopetegui combed his hand through his hair, his whirring mind in overdrive, under pressure.

The Guardian,The best beauty gifts: Sali Hughes’s present picks for Christmas 2024,"From luxury gift sets to TikTok-famous products, here’s everything you need to delight the beauty lovers in your life this yearI’m surprised by how many people seem to believe beauty is a risky theme for gift giving. There’s a belief that there’s something inherently impolite or implicitly critical about a present designed to improve the appearance of the recipient. But the instinct to groom is universal, self-care is healthy and almost everyone likes to look their best.Provided one avoids specific “problem solvers”, like anti-wrinkle cream, hair removal (or, indeed, its restoration) and anything related to cellulite, then there’s no reason for anyone to take offence. Well-chosen beauty products make great stocking fillers, luxury presents and spare gifts for unexpected visitors, such as new partners or stray aunts.

Then I remembered Kelly Canby’s picture book A Leaf Called Greaf, and realised we actually had found the right words – they were in Canby’s book. Picture books are good like that.A Leaf Called Greaf is about a lonely bear who finds a “beguiling” green leaf, and with it, comfort and companionship. Greaf (short for “green leaf”) changes with the seasons and eventually crumbles to pieces; gone but still surrounding Bear. It’s a gentle story with emotive windswept-looking illustrations that hint at the family Bear once had.

This year’s religious masterpiece is different. Parmigianino’s tall (3.5m) yet narrow painting The Vision of St Jerome is wild, quirky and gets more subversive the longer you look at it. For one thing, there is a female nude hidden in this devotional scene. Parmigianino has changed the gender and aged her – but once you see it there’s no mistaking his quotation of one of the most sensual paintings in the European canon.The Vision of St Jerome gets its title from the sleeping figure of the hermit Jerome lying under a rocky overhang in a leafy bower by a pool. Parmigianino paints him from an unexpected angle: feet towards us, head flung back, his body at once vertical and horizontal as he thrusts his loins in your face, his body forcing itself out of the picture into 3D space.

It’s a similar feeling to when I was learning to swim, or trying to ride a bike when the stabilisers were removed and you go all wobbly and anxious. How can I get my confidence back to stay hard?The anxiety you feel at times when you are expecting your penis to perform is actually ensuring that you are less likely to achieve an erection. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. Some men find that learning to reduce their anxiety at such times can improve their ability to have erections. Others find that talking to their doctor about the possibility of being prescribed a drug to help erectile functioning can provide the erectile support they need, and reduce anxiety. Sometimes there is an underlying medical, relational or psychological issue that is inhibiting a man’s erectile capacity, so it is really worth having a medical workup and checking in with a sexual therapist.

And ever since it was established by the prophet Muhammad – who described Friday prayers as an “Eid” or celebration – there has been an idea of wearing your “Friday best”.

When I arrive at her place – a detached but unassuming house upfront, and a warren of more recently built workshops at the back, filled with beautiful pianos, a massive mixing desk and the harpsichord she played on her album Boys for Pele – we have lunch with her husband and sound engineer, Mark Hawley. The conversation roams through football, raving, legal training (their 24-year-old daughter Tash is studying law in Washington DC) and how good the pumpkin soup is.

The Guardian,Inside the Vatican’s secret saint-making process,"Canonisation has long been a way for the Catholic church to shape its image. The Vatican is preparing to anoint its first millennial saint, but how does it decide who is worthy?As a child growing up in Milan, Carlo Acutis collected stories of miracles. He wrote about the time when, in 1411, wine turned to blood in a castle chapel in Ludbreg, Croatia; of how, in 1630, a pastor in Canosio, Italy, saved his town from a flood by blessing the raging waters; of how, in 1906, a priest on the island of Tumaco, Colombia, held up a reliquary on the beach to stop an approaching tsunami. Acutis, 11 years old and a devout Catholic, began typing up these stories and posting them on his website, which he styled as a “virtual museum” of miraculous events. A section on the site invited visitors to “discover how many friends you have in heaven”, and to read stories of young saints.Acutis hoped to one day join their ranks. He was convinced that he would die before he reached adulthood and told his mother, Antonia, that he would perish of “a broken vein in his brain”. He wanted to be buried in the town of Assisi, where his family had a summer home. In the meantime, he devoted his life to the church, which was a surprise to his largely secular parents. As a teenager, he taught catechism classes to young children, and offered them a step-by-step guide to becoming a saint. ““Always remember that you, too, can become a saint!” he would say. Every day, they were to go to mass, recite the Holy Rosary, read the scripture and confess their sins. Continue reading...","Tue, 03 Dec 2024 05:00:43 GMT",0.0,0.9208

The Guardian,Why Joe Biden pardoned his son – podcast,"Hunter Biden was awaiting sentencing for gun and tax offences when, suddenly, his father pardoned him. Has family loyalty been put above presidential integrity? Chris Michael explainsJoe Biden’s love for his family has long softened his public persona.

And Parisian fashion is at its height – people wear beautiful layered clothes.” In addition to his wife, Wendy, and their children David and Sarah, Coggins enjoys painting “the witty, romantic life of Parisians.
