The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: US grants $6bn in aid to Ukraine before Trump inauguration,"Aid package includes weapons and economic assistance to pay for critical government services; Ukraine foreign minister visits Syria. What we know on day 1,042The US has unveiled almost $6bn in military and budget aid for Ukraine, as the Biden administration works quickly to spend all the money it has available to help Kyiv fight off Russia before president-elect Donald Trump takes office next month. “I’ve directed my administration to continue surging as much assistance to Ukraine as quickly as possible,” Biden said in a statement. “At my direction, the United States will continue to work relentlessly to strengthen Ukraine’s position in this war over the remainder of my time in office.” The package includes nearly $2.5bn more in weapons, as well as $3.4bn in economic assistance to help pay for critical government services, including salaries for civilian government and school employees, healthcare workers and first responders.Ukrainian forces have staged a new attack on the town of Lgov in southern Russia’s Kursk region, badly damaging a two-storey apartment building, the region’s acting governor said on Monday, a week after four people were killed in another strike. Alexander Khinshtein, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said one person was injured in the latest attack in the region, where Ukrainian forces have seized a chunk of territory after launching an incursion in August. “Their purpose is to frighten people, sow confusion, panic and chaos,” Khinshtein said of the Ukrainian attack. “And to deny children the chance to enjoy the forthcoming New Year.”Russia and Ukraine have carried out a major prisoner exchange, with at least 150 people from each side returning home before New Year’s Eve, in a swap partly brokered by the United Arab Emirates. “The return of our people from Russian captivity is always very good news for each of us,” the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in a message posted on Telegram on Monday. “My son is 5 years old now, the last time I saw him he was 2 years old,” said Serhii, who was captured by Russian forces at the Azovstal steel mill in the southern port Mariupol, which withstood a siege for nearly three months in 2022.Ukraine is pledging support for the new authorities in Syria, which was once a key Russian ally in the Mideast. Ukraine’s foreign minister met with Syria’s de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus on Monday, days after Kyiv announced the delivery of a large shipment of wheat flour to the country after the ouster of Bashar al-Assad, who has been granted asylum in Moscow. Foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said he hopes “that a new Syria would become a country that respects international law”. “The Russian and Assad regimes supported each other because their foundation is violence and torture,” he added.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has vowed to step up bilateral relations with Russia in a letter to President Vladimir Putin on Monday, state media KCNA reported on Tuesday. In the message, Kim sent New Year greetings to Putin and all Russians, including their troops and “wished that the New Year 2025 would be recorded as the first year of victory in the 21st century when the Russian army and people would defeat neo-nazism and achieve a great victory,” KCNA said. Kim and Putin signed a mutual defence treaty at a summit in June, which calls for each side to come to the other’s aid in the event of an armed attack, and Pyongyang has since dispatched tens of thousands of troops to Russia to support its war effort, according to Ukraine, the US and South Korea.

The Guardian,Leaky ceilings and sinking floors: inside St Helier hospital where staff fear for patients,"St Helier’s NHS trust had been promised new building – but faces uncertainty after project put under review by chancellorEngland’s rundown hospitals are ‘outright dangerous’, say NHS chiefsSt Helier hospital is older than the NHS itself. A once beautiful modernist building that admitted its first patients in 1941, it has been left to crumble. The white paint is chipping at every corner of its formerly gleaming exterior and its state of the art balconies have been fenced off due to modern safety regulations.More pressing concerns for staff are the structural issues that make their already challenging jobs much harder. Large windows built for an optimal stream of ventilation are held together with masking tape to stop them falling in on staff and patients. Corridor floors are sinking into the ground and seep mud, and lifts are out of service so often that ambulances are used to take the most vulnerable patients from side exits in wards to the main hospital building or the intensive care unit.

It is by Vladimir Nazor, who was Croatia’s first head of state.The first stanza includes the satisfyingly low on vowels and onomatopoeic phrase: “cvrči, cvrči cvrčak” (pronounced “tvrchi, tvrchi tvrchak”) – which translates as “chirp, chirp cicada”.And the cicada chirps, chirps on the knot of the black spruce

Without it, I have more time for a life well spentI am not sure when I gave up wearing makeup. I was never particularly good at it. As a student, I was thrown into an early 2000s performance of femininity that involved thick eyeliner flicks, dyed hair, doll-like blusher and bright pink lips. I felt the pressure of magazines, adverts and other women’s faces pressing me towards cosmetics like a hockey player being clapped into drinking beer out of their own shoe.The fact that I never had the patience or the money to pull it off didn’t seem to matter. I wore makeup to work and even more makeup to sweat off on the dancefloor when I wasn’t at work. As my 20s slid into my 30s, I still wore mascara most days. I still owned lipsticks and liquid eyeliners and a vintage powder compact. I could still slap it on in the office toilet mirrors, under the arctic glare of a unisex lightbulb.

After the general’s successful coup in 1977, his regime ushered in martial law, trampled on women’s rights, enforced strict censorship and placed draconian restrictions on artistic expression.Ascent of Man, an abstract painting by Quddus Mirza, is inspired by the controversial trial and hanging of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the democratically elected prime minister overthrown by the coup. The painting, part of a groundbreaking exhibition of Pakistan’s art and architecture, depicts a man sitting in a chair while a headless body floats in the sky. It blends elements of magic realism with an allusion to the seventh-century martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali, a grandson of the prophet Muhammad whose death was a major episode in Islam’s history that still resonates today.

The Guardian,"‘We’ve been through the wringer’: Doves on addiction, breakdowns – and touring without singer Jimi Goodwin","Their new album Constellations for the Lonely ranks among their best work. But as they prepare to go on the road, the Williams brothers talk about their momentous decision to play without GoodwinJust over four years ago, Doves were on the crest of a wave. Their first album in more than a decade – The Universal Want – had been rapturously received, helping them notch up their third UK No 1. All set to perform it live, the tour was suddenly cancelled due to frontman Jimi Goodwin’s mental health – he has since said he is in recovery from substance abuse.The cancellation “was heartbreaking for us because this is all we’ve ever wanted to do,” explains guitarist Jez Williams, who formed Doves with drummer brother Andy and schoolfriend Goodwin in Wilmslow, Cheshire in 1998. Sat alongside him in a Manchester eaterie, Andy explains: “You can get away with that once, but if we had to pull a tour again it would be curtains.” Thus, in late 2023, with a new album on the way, and Goodwin telling them he still wasn’t up to touring, they made the momentous decision to go on the road without him.

I have lambasted corporate Britain for letting the populace down. I’ve self-righteously blamed airlines for leaving passengers grounded, I’ve hounded energy firms for slugging pensioners with invented bills and exposed councils and insurers for pushing households into homelessness. These last 12 months it’s dawned on me that my ire has been misplaced. The fault lies squarely with consumers and their penchant for illicit activity.Take those airline passengers. Observer readers, it seems, have form when it comes to trying to smuggle illegal items on board.

But one thing is clear: the Games’ organisers failed to live up to the event’s valuesAs Rebeca Andrade, Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles stood behind the podium at the medal ceremony for the Olympic women’s gymnastics floor exercise in Paris, the significance of the moment was clear to all. Their collective success marked the first time in history that three black gymnasts had won bronze, silver and gold at the Olympic Games. And after years of pushing the greatest gymnast of all time to the limit, Brazil’s Andrade had finally outperformed Biles.In the frenetic moments between competition and ceremony, Chiles and Biles agreed that the special circumstances merited a statement. When Andrade stepped up with her arms aloft to collect the gold medal, the two Americans bowed down to the Brazilian. Andrade extended a hand to each gymnast in response. “Not only has she given Simone her flowers, but a lot of us in the United States our flowers as well,” said Chiles after the event, meaning flowers as a metaphor for recognition. “So giving it back is what makes it so beautiful. I felt like it was needed.” Continue reading...","Mon, 30 Dec 2024 09:00:32 GMT",0.2484,0.9962
The Guardian,Here’s a tip for the world’s politicians: sorry shouldn’t be the hardest word | Simon Jenkins,"There is a clear benefit in taking responsibility for mistakes. So why do so many leaders fob off the public with obfuscation?The Korean chief executive of Jeju Air, Kim E-bae, could not have been more direct. After the crash of one of the airline’s planes he went straight to the microphone, bowed deeply and said, “Regardless of the cause, as CEO, I feel profound responsibility for this incident.” He offered his “deepest condolences and apologies to the families of the passengers who lost their lives”.The statement seemed unusual. Last week, another plane crash, this time in Kazakhstan, was acknowledged by a man similarly “responsible”, Russia’s Vladimir Putin. In a contorted message to his fellow leader in Azerbaijan, he said how sorry he was about “a tragic incident that occurred in Russian airspace”. He expressed condolences but no responsibility for what has been widely accepted as a Russian missile attack, however unintended. Putin appeared not sorry, but devious.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,My friend Jimmy Carter will be remembered long after other presidents are forgotten. Here’s why | Gordon Brown,"His rise to the Oval Office was meteoric. But what he did afterwards set the standard for statesmanship and public serviceGordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Though Jimmy Carter was, at the age of 100, the US president who had lived longer than any of the other 45 occupants of the office, he will be remembered for a more important reason. He is, and will be, mourned in every country and continent where civil liberties are valued and peace has proved elusive; revered as the leader who stood with all those who faced imprisonment, torture or persecution for defending democracy and human rights. Carter gave oppressed people hope. I was proud to learn from him and to count him and his wonderful wife, Rosalynn – who was also his closest adviser – as friends.How to assess such a life? History will probably see Carter’s second act – his work as a former president – as more momentous than his four years in the Oval Office, from 1977 to 1981. In office, despite his negotiation of the landmark peace deal between Israel and Egypt, he was engulfed by intractable problems – the first oil shock, rampant inflation that was to reach 14% in 1980 – and, with the rise of a militant Iran, the destabilisation of the Middle East, problems that condemned him to a one-term presidency.

The Guardian,TikTok has opened the door to a new age of medical misinformation – and I’m seeing the results in A&E | Ammad Butt,"As a doctor, I am now seeing patients who have chosen not to take medication on the advice of online wellness influencersIn the age of the internet, Googling symptoms and treatments has been common practice for patients, and sometimes even doctors. The recent explosion in popularity of podcasts and short-form video content such as TikTok, however, has increased the amount of misinformation in search results to levels we have not seen previously – and this is now having tangible effects in the concerns patients present with in clinics and A&amp;E.This month’s BBC report around Steven Bartlett’s podcast, The Diary of a CEO, showed it was spreading harmful health misinformation, capturing a wider image of a moment we are currently seeing – people have less trust in health professionals and are increasingly relying on videos and other engaging content they see online.Ammad Butt is a freelance writer and foundation doctor at University Hospitals BirminghamDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Is it true that up to half of people have no inner monologue? I investigated | Arwa Mahdawi,"Our brains are miraculous and weird things, and it turns out everyone has different ways of processing the worldSometimes I like to start a column by asking myself: should this really be a column that will live on the internet forever, for all and sundry to see? Or is this really an airing of my many neuroses that is better shared privately, with a therapist?Not infrequently the answer is the latter.

The Guardian,"Take it from me, the queen of sleep – micro-naps will transform your life | Emma Brockes","These little wonders will give you a much-needed boost, and this is the perfect time to practice. Go on, you only need 10 minutesI’m a big napper. World class, in fact. I can go from awake to the bottom of the ocean in five minutes flat, like a high diver off a cliff. It’s a longstanding talent of mine, but I’ve noticed, lately, that unlike other facilities that wane with middle age, my napping skills are only growing stronger. Times were when I wouldn’t have dared reach for a nap unless I had a clean hour before the next commitment. Now, with even 15 minutes to spare – 10 at an absolute push – I’ll risk it. It might look like narcolepsy, but I know the truth: that micro-napping is the key to everything.I mean, not everything, obviously. But it is definitely the key to functionality after 4pm, the second shift when your kids come home from school and you reward them with your frazzled, after-work energy. Too much screen-time happens in my house because the idea of sitting on the floor to play Anarchy Pancakes or Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza with my nine-year-olds feels like a request to put on iron trousers and climb a steep hill. (And, as I’ve discovered, the only thing worse than not playing is playing in a limp, half-arsed way then calling the game off after one round with a bright “that was fun!” that makes everyone scowl.)

The Guardian,"If popular culture is anything to go by, 2024 is the year we simply gave up | Kirsty Major","Charli xcx covered in red wine, Anna Sorokin in an ankle tag on Dancing with the Stars – it has been 12 months marked by chaos, indulgence and messIf culture is the mirror that reflects the state of society, right now we’re all looking a little dishevelled – and struggling to find the energy to care. The signs have been there for a while, with rumblings initially picked up by trend forecasters’ finely tuned cultural seismometers. In 2021, Sean Monahan coined the term “the vibe shift” in his Substack to explain the transition from the self-controlled, self-improvement-obsessed worthiness of the 2010s to the messy decadence of the 2020s. Three years later, it feels like that earthquake has finally hit.The text of the year was, of course, the album Brat by Charli xcx, and the image that summed it all up was from the lead single’s music video: the pop star pouring a glass of red wine while standing on a vibrating power plate, spilling it down her white T-shirt and staring defiantly into the camera. In the background, actor Rachel Sennott scrolls on her phone on an exercise ball and actor and model Julia Fox vapes while curling a dumbbell. If not dancing, this is casually leaning on the grave of wellness culture. The message is: ‘“It’s OK to be a bit messy, physically and mentally, and let’s have a good time while we’re at it.” While accepting a prize at the Wall Street Journal’s Innovator awards, the musician said: “Luckily for me, the pendulum of culture swung in favour of messiness, personality and the niche.”Kirsty Major is a deputy Opinion editor for the Guardian Continue reading...","Mon, 30 Dec 2024 08:00:31 GMT",0.4215,0.9206
The Guardian,Jimmy Carter’s life after the presidency set a bar that few others have reached | Jan-Werner Müller,"Carter was a man of extraordinary integrity. No president after him succeeded at doing as much post-White House goodJimmy Carter’s presidency has been etched into historical memory as a failure. That judgment is curious, particularly when it comes from American conservatives; many of the right’s favorite policies – deregulation and a ruthless fight against inflation, no matter the cost in unemployment – were actually started under Carter. Of course, the more that malaise can be associated with the peanut farmer from Georgia, the shinier becomes his successor, Ronald Reagan, conservatism’s greatest 20th-century hero.What should be beyond dispute is that Carter was the most successful ex-president of the postwar period, and perhaps the greatest former president, period. That has a lot do with his sheer integrity. But the fact that no former chief executive after Carter managed to emulate his model – using their skills and access to do genuinely important things in politics, rather than mostly cashing in – says much about our times.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on City deregulation: it would be a dangerous step backward | Editorial,"Relaxing financial rules risks undermining stability, ignoring post-crash lessons and prioritising short-term gains over the long-term health of the economyRachel Reeves’s enthusiasm for the City of London – the “crown jewel in our economy” – raises concerns. Economists were worried enough to publicly warn her this month that liberalising financial sector regulations could undermine the government’s efforts to grow the economy, posing “particular risks to the government’s wider industrial strategy”. They also stressed the importance of not forgetting the painful lessons of the 2008 global financial crisis.The experts were responding to the chancellor’s November Mansion House speech, in which Ms Reeves suggested that post-crisis regulations have “gone too far”. This is a troubling statement. Those rules were implemented to curb the sector’s excesses, prevent systemic risks and ensure that the Treasury does not have to bail out its failures. Rolling back such measures&nbsp;in the name of economic growth ignores the&nbsp;stability and protection they’ve provided.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on rewriting classics: what the Dickens? | Editorial,"Retellings of novels like Huckleberry Finn and David Copperfield help to keep the canon aliveIt might have lost out at the Booker, but James, a reworking of Huckleberry Finn by Percival Everett, was the unofficial book of 2024, topping best-of-the-year lists and winning the prestigious US Book Award for fiction. Everett retells Mark Twain’s 1884 picaresque novel about a 13-year-old boy’s escapades on the Mississippi from the perspective of runaway slave Jim. Shocking, gripping and surprisingly comic, it’s a bravura performance that celebrates and subverts the original.Its success follows that of last year’s Women’s prize-winning Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver, a dazzling 550-page updating of Charles Dickens’ David Copperfield transported to the author’s home region of Appalachia during the 1990s opioid epidemic. As the supreme chronicler of social injustice, Dickens provided Kingsolver with “a masterclass” in how to use narrative to make readers care about a latter-day&nbsp;underclass.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Church of England must open up its governance to scrutiny | Letters,"Readers respond to the archbishop of York saying the church should kneel in penitence as it faces criticism over its handling of abuse casesIt is difficult to comprehend why the Anglican Church allowed known abusers into positions of trust, and continued to tolerate situations that should have been impossible (C of E must ‘kneel in penitence’ after difficult year, says archbishop of York, 25 December).A church has no knees but those of its members, most of whom, in this case, were surely oblivious of the situation. That the archbishop of York chose to use figurative language at such a portentous moment offers a small clue to the problem. Why did Stephen Cottrell need an adviser to tell him that a known abuser should not hold any office in the church?

The Guardian,Psychedelic experiences in clinical settings | Letters,"If clinicians cannot put the experience into words, then how can patients give informed consent that meets the robust medico-legal standard, asks Dr Caroline HayesAlthough it is refreshing to read a more balanced article on psychedelics (Experts warn of mental health risks after rise in magic mushroom use, 25 December), we must be cautious about accepting the paternalistic notion that the clinical setting is always the most appropriate.“Set and setting” – one’s mindset and the physical and social environment – are hugely influential on the psychedelic experience, and for some marginalised communities and patient groups, the medical establishment may be associated with difficult or traumatic experiences, and therefore not the ideal setting for taking psychedelics. This is perhaps reflected in the lack of diversity of psychedelic clinical trial participants. Although this is a problem across clinical research as a whole, it is more of a concern for psychedelic trials as the psychedelic experience is very culturally specific.

The Guardian,Rachel Roddy’s recipe for ham baked in bread | A kitchen in Rome,"A novel approach to a side of gammon, wrapped in fresh bread, may well be your new favourite party centrepieceAs well as being a glorious thing, a well-cured ham is a generous thing, giving many times over. The first is the simmering, which Nigella Lawson describes as “a savoury clove-scented fog” filling the room, poaching the joint and creating a highly flavoured stock for later use. Then comes the second fog of roasting meat and, in the case of this recipe, the bread wrapped around it, which is an idea borrowed from a cafeteria buffet in Trieste.There is the pleasure of ham itself, too, brought to the table, carved and enjoyed, but only up to a point. When it comes to ham, it isn’t enough to hope that there are leftovers; it is necessary to ensure that there are leftovers, for sandwiches or to go with fried eggs and thin chips. And because a little ham goes a long way, I hope for leftovers of leftovers, which can be cut into small chunks and added to ham stock and pea soup.

Now, say researchers, women and girls are being sucked into potentially dangerous online spaces of their own: the femosphere.It is a term used by Dr Jilly Kay, an expert in feminist media and cultural studies at Loughborough University, in a paper published earlier this year. Kay has been researching a reactionary turn among young women, and how a backlash against mainstream feminism has created new spaces online. In the femosphere, instead of “incels” – male involuntary celibates – there are “femcels”, and instead of pickup artists there are female dating strategists and so-called “dark feminine” influencers who encourage women to find men to support them financially.

Staged at a Scottish castle (Ardross Castle in the Highlands, north of Inverness), it features a group of selected Traitors who must “murder” the Faithful, while the Faithful identify and banish Traitors. If a Traitor evades detection and makes it to the end, they swipe the entire prize pot, totalling as much as £120k.So, yes, it’s a gameshow, but, as those in thrall to the cloaked global entertainment franchise could tell you, it’s also so much more than that. It’s a dark and terrible dance of back-stabbing and scheming. It’s the pungent base notes of human nature. It’s the cynical celebration of deceit as a life skill.

How did this nascent national treasure turn trauma into triumph?There’s a stockpot simmering on Andi Oliver’s stove – for days, the broth has been bubbling. A mugful of the rib-sticking, rich elixir lands in front of me as I’m ushered into her east London kitchen from the cold. She ladles out a flask-full for Garfield, her boyfriend of 30 years, then peers into the saucepan. “I’ve not been well,” says Oliver, “and this has healed me.” She spent the past two months filming in Stratford-upon-Avon, where she always had a similar soup on the go. “It’s giving yourself the care you need. And sharing it with other people doesn’t just fix you, but briefly, the world around you.” Supplies depleted, she begins to rebuild the brew from its bones: pinches of cloves, juniper and star anise are dropped in. A glug of white wine. Taste, then season. No measurements, just instinct. “I started cooking young,” Oliver explains. “To me, it’s everyday magic. Giving you that broth is sharing a little bit of myself – a soul exchange.” Briefly, there’s a moment of serenity.Scout, the ageing family dog, comes in barking. The phone rings, twice. Unidentified clattering upstairs. Hers is a house that’s lived in. “Just to flag,” Oliver warns, “anyone might just appear. This place is like Piccadilly Circus.” A steady stream of people do wander through. First, Kelly, close colleague and confidante. Garfield next. Then Oliver’s mum pootles through, nonplussed by a stranger’s presence.

The Guardian,"The big picture: Colleen Kenyon’s new year portrait of her twin sister, 1977","The late feminist artists explored ideas of doubling and twinship, as well as helping to redefine notions of craft skillsThe photographer Colleen Kenyon made this new year portrait of her identical twin sister Kathleen in 1977. At the time the two of them were embarking on a shared artistic journey that put them at the forefront of feminist artists interested in reclaiming and redefining “craft” skills, using photomontage and hand-colouring techniques to celebrate and ironise traditionally “domestic” artistic expression, such as scrapbooking. Over the subsequent 25 years the twins, born in 1951, pursued this practice at the Center for Photography at Woodstock in upstate New York, where Colleen became executive director in 1981 and her sister joined her as associate director. Together they developed the exhibition space and a programme of workshops to make the institution a prime mover in the advancement of women in the arts, and for artists of colour.Their own distinctive photographic ideas developed both individually and in tandem in those years. Colleen focused on intricate print-making techniques and delicate hand-colouring of female portraits, while Kathleen pursued her interest in collage, often manipulating mass-produced images of women to give them a pointed comic or political edge. Frequently, the sisters explored ideas of doubling and twinship – their academic parents had dressed them identically until they were 10, before they each insisted on making their own fashion choices – and their art examines their shared genetics and discrete characters in multiple ways.

The Guardian,A ceramicist’s personal take on commemorative blue plaques – in pictures,"For more than 25 years, Horace Lindezey has been making art at Venture Arts, a Manchester-based studio working with learning disabled artists.

I like showing them in exhibitions, in Blackburn and London. I like to see them out there – they are nice memories of some people that have died.”A limited edition book of The Blue Plaques (£25), signed by the artist, is available at venturearts.org Continue reading...","Sat, 28 Dec 2024 17:00:43 GMT",0.0,0.9545
