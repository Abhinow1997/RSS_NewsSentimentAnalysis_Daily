The Guardian,Renaissance: The Blood and the Beauty review – Charles Dance is gloriously game as Michelangelo,"This astonishing docu-drama delves into the blazing rivalry between Michelangelo, Raphael and Leonardo – and Dance somehow resists the urge to ham it up to the max. Whatever you do, just don’t make a Ninja Turtles jokeThere is a growing fashion in historical documentary-making for blending factual accounts with dramatised versions thereof. Royal Kill List (about the Restoration) and Royal Bastards: The Rise of the Tudors used actors to deliver both, but others prefer to use sensible people for at least the factual stuff, and the latter is the path Renaissance: The Blood and the Beauty has chosen to follow.Here are gathered contemporary artists including Antony Gormley, Alison Lapper, biographers of the artistic colossi under discussion and art historians aplenty, along with pertinent others, such as Sarah Dunant – author of several novels about Renaissance Italy. Their role is to impart the vital facts about the careers, creations and increasingly intense rivalries of Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael (the first person to make a Ninja turtles joke can see me after class) in 15th- ’n’ a little bit of 16th-century Florence – and Milan, Rome, Tuscany and Umbria. But mostly Florence, at least when it wasn’t being steamrollered by Savonarola.Renaissance: The Blood and the Beauty aired on BBC One and is available on iPlayer.

The Guardian,Liz Truss is apparently too mad even for a rightwing US audience | John Crace,"Former PM’s speech to the Heritage Foundation declares just about everyone alive to be part of a communist conspiracyIt was a sight for sore eyes. At least for any speaker who has turned up to an event to discover the organisers easily outnumber the audience. In an anonymous, windowless room in Washington DC, there were just a handful of people seated around a couple of circular tables for the latest session hosted by the rightwing – and conspiracy theory adjacent – US thinktank, the Heritage Foundation. Let’s hope there were rather more watching online.This is Liz Truss’s safe space. America, her last refuge. A nation that regards her 49-day tenure as prime minister a badge of honour rather than a sign of failure. In the UK, no one wants to know Liz any more. The Tory party just wish she would crawl under a stone. She’s the source of much of their embarrassment. Nor could her former constituents wait to see the back of her. Her loss was Norfolk’s gain.

The Guardian,‘It’s about consequences’: what can we expect from Wicked: Part Two?,"The much-anticipated first part of the blockbuster musical adaptation has bewitched audiences worldwide, but there are dark times ahead in the sequelSpoilers aheadDespite more than a year of build-up and an exhaustive – some might say exhausting – press tour that rivaled a Marvel movie in budget, there were still many people who did not know that Wicked, now the most successful film adaptation of a Broadway musical of all time, is actually one half of a pair.To be fair to those who do not follow the entertainment industry, Universal billed the 2hr 40min film, which opens with Ariana Grande’s Glinda the Good Witch promising to tell the “whole story” of her long-lost friend Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), as just Wicked, not by its title card, Wicked: Part One. And Jon M Chu’s first act concludes with a wildly cathartic, very CGI-ed rendition of Defying Gravity – the rare musical tune to transcend theater-kid fandom and probably the one thing non-Wicked fans would know about the show.

The Guardian,Nosferatu review – Robert Eggers’s respectful homage to a vampire horror classic,"The second remake of FW Murnau’s unofficial Dracula adaptation is handsomely shot and stylised, with a forbiddingly gruesome monster, but walks the line between self-conscious and scaryHere is Robert Eggers’s avowed passion project as writer-director: a luxury-arthouse remake on a grand scale, paying homage to FW Murnau’s classic silent film from 1922, the German expressionist nightmare of Count Orlok, or Nosferatu, the “evil one”, a pallid vampire living in the shadow of the Carpathian Mountains. Eggers’s film can’t quite bear to say the comedy word “Transylvania” out loud, though we get to glimpse it on a map. It is an interesting new Nosferatu for our age of pandemic fear, with some beautiful images and striking moments, particularly in the eerie moonlit hallucination sequence at the beginning, which makes the rest of the story feel slightly literal and self-conscious.The German stage actor Max Schreck was the vampire in the 1922 version, and Klaus Kinski was in Werner Herzog’s 1979 remake. Now it is Bill Skarsgård (known for playing Stephen King’s scary clown Pennywise) who stays semi-shadowed for much of the film. He is undead but intimidatingly athletic, like an animated corpse, ripped in every sense. He is not hairless in the traditional Orlok way, having a bushy moustache, and he speaks in a booming native tongue with borderline-ridiculous subtitles. It is the early 19th century, and the count plans to buy property in the fictional German port town of Wisborg with the help of a cringingly submissive secret acolyte there, to bring his ancient evil into the heart of enlightened Europe. Orlok tricks an innocent, wholesome young realtor into making the perilous journey to his castle to oversee the document signing in person, but he plans to set the seal on his imperial expansion with the ecstatically obscene blood-conquest of this man’s demure young bride, for whom he has conceived a telepathic passion; she sees him in her dreams.

The Guardian,‘The whole foundation is rocking’: inside the explosive film about the investigation of Benjamin Netanyahu,"The Bibi Files contains leaked footage of the Israeli PM being interrogated by police over allegations of corruption – and argues that these are partly why he has taken the region into the abyss. We meet the journalist behind itThe Bibi Files, a new documentary, begins with its eponymous antihero, Benjamin Netanyahu, being read his rights by police interrogators. His oblong, jowled face is well known – Netanyahu has been Israel’s prime minister for a total of 17 years – but we are accustomed to seeing him in charge of events, behind a lectern haranguing his country and the world beyond. We have never seen him like this.Late last year, videos of police questioning of Netanyahu, his family, his rich backers and his disillusioned aides were leaked to Alex Gibney, an Oscar-winning American documentary maker and one of the producers of The Bibi Files. The tapes were recorded between 2016 and 2018 and appear for the first time in The Bibi Files, which premiered at festivals in Toronto and New York but still cannot be viewed in Israel.

The Guardian,The best beauty gifts: Sali Hughes’s present picks for Christmas 2024,"From luxury gift sets to TikTok-famous products, here’s everything you need to delight the beauty lovers in your life this yearI’m surprised by how many people seem to believe beauty is a risky theme for gift giving. There’s a belief that there’s something inherently impolite or implicitly critical about a present designed to improve the appearance of the recipient. But the instinct to groom is universal, self-care is healthy and almost everyone likes to look their best.Provided one avoids specific “problem solvers”, like anti-wrinkle cream, hair removal (or, indeed, its restoration) and anything related to cellulite, then there’s no reason for anyone to take offence. Well-chosen beauty products make great stocking fillers, luxury presents and spare gifts for unexpected visitors, such as new partners or stray aunts.

Only nasty people are out to jail him. Live and let live. Yet there is something monumental in the pardon granted by the outgoing US president, Joe Biden. Six months ago, he scored political points by denying he would pardon his son Hunter Biden. Now, with the election over, he has done so.The easy response is: what is new? President Gerald Ford pardoned his predecessor, Richard Nixon; Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother and other figures whose families had donated to the Democrats; Donald Trump pardoned his son-in-law’s father and dodgy aides galore. No one doubts that, as president, Trump will pardon a number of outrageous figures – perhaps even the Capitol Hill rioters of 2021.

The Guardian,Here’s the real story of the Irish election: beneath the appearance of calm lies a storm | Fintan O'Toole,"Ireland has, in effect, full employment, an expanded workforce and a booming economy. So why is it such a nation in flux?The best description of Ireland’s political landscape after Friday’s general election might be: strangely familiar. The familiar bit is easy. The two main incumbent parties, Micheál Martin’s Fianna Fáil and Simon Harris’s Fine Gael, received almost exactly the same combined share of the vote (43%) as they did in 2020. As a result, the identical twins of Irish politics that have governed the state since it came into being just over a century ago will continue to do so.One of them, Fianna Fáil, which has won the most seats this time, emerged as the dominant political machine in the 1930s and was almost permanently in charge until its vote imploded in 2011 after the bloody death of the Celtic Tiger. It is now edging back, if not towards its old ascendancy, then certainly into a comfortable seat at the centre of power. Its like-minded partner, Fine Gael, has been continually in government in one form or another since 2011, and if the incoming administration lasts a full term it will remain there until 2029.Fintan O’Toole is a columnist with the Irish Times and the author of We Don’t Know Ourselves: A Personal History of Modern Ireland Continue reading...","Mon, 02 Dec 2024 16:27:32 GMT",-0.128,0.9217

The Guardian,I was terrified of being the last single woman left among my friends. Then I made peace with it | Édaein O’ Connell,"My life’s markers may differ from those of my peers, but a year of freedom and fun has taught me to appreciate myselfFrom the ages of 18 to 21, I spent quite a lot of time crying in my local nightclub in the small town of Listowel in Ireland. My reason for weeping was that all my friends were pulling and I wasn’t. If I could go back in time, I’d give myself a stern talking to, hand myself a shot and say: “Of course no one’s trying it on – you’re wailing Céline Dion in the corner.”Back then I was terrified of becoming the last single friend in the girl gang. I was petrified of being left behind, abandoned for a man who wore bootcut jeans with brown dress shoes. Every time a friend announced, “I have a date,” my body would seize up. Then I found myself in a relationship. While my friends were out on the town, living the free and single life, I was staying in, curled up under a duvet with my partner, eating takeaway and feeling smug because I didn’t need to be on a dating app.Édaein O’ Connell is a freelance journalist Continue reading...","Mon, 02 Dec 2024 07:00:18 GMT",0.3818,0.9517
The Guardian,"From Beirut to Khartoum, the Arab world is changing beyond our recognition | Nesrine Malik","The Arab world is increasingly divided between those who are losing everything, and those who have everythingFor the past few months, there has been a grim new ritual whenever I meet people from some Arab countries. It’s a sort of mutual commiseration and checking in. How are things with you? Where is your family? I hope you are safe, I hope they are safe. I hope you are OK. We are with you.There is a comfort to it, and also an awkwardness. Comfort because the words are earnest, the solidarity almost unbearably meaningful. Awkward because the scale of what many are enduring is too large to be captured in those words. Everything feels shot through with survivor’s guilt, but also with a little bit of resolve in the knowledge that the calamities tearing apart our nations have closed the distances between us.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Gregg Wallace and the BBC: exposing poor conduct is in the public interest | Editorial,"By drawing attention to the troubling behaviour of a male celebrity, Kirsty Wark recalls the spirit of #MeTooFamous men should not take advantage of their status to engage in sexually inappropriate behaviour, or make explicit remarks, at work. If and when this happens, their bosses should ensure that it is stopped.&nbsp;This might seem obvious. But in an interview for BBC News last week, Kirsty Wark, the former Newsnight host, described how when she was a contestant on Celebrity MasterChef in 2011, she complained to the production company about the show’s co-presenter Gregg Wallace. She thought a sexualised monologue he delivered early one morning on set was so ill-judged that it made her angry, and worried that staff on short-term contracts would not feel able to object.BBC News also heard from 12 other people making various allegations. That it has taken so many years for these claims to emerge strongly suggests that the impunity enjoyed by celebrities is an ongoing cultural problem in the media industry. Mr Wallace has apologised for a video made at the weekend, in which he suggested the complaints against him came from “a handful of middle-class women of a certain age”. He is cooperating with an investigation by MasterChef’s production company, Banijay UK.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Keir Starmer’s reset: it needs a vision to tackle Britain’s challenges | Editorial,"The prime minister faces scrutiny as voters demand bold action, not recycled policies, to address Britain’s deepening economic and social concernsSir Keir Starmer’s reboot is clearly a strategy to win over voters disillusioned with the government’s performance. The prime minister is personally unpopular. Labour’s standing in the polls has sunk after avoidable fights with pensioners and farmers. The public seem unimpressed by Sir Keir’s contradictory stance that Labour faces a worse inheritance than expected, yet his pre-election framing remains unchanged. If the former is true, the latter seems doubtful. Voters expect a government to tackle problems, not lament them. Hence, Sir Keir’s team aims to cast the five “missions” he outlined on the campaign trail into a delivery plan with updated targets.Sounds familiar? It echoes the approach of the previous prime minister, Rishi Sunak. In January 2023, Mr Sunak attempted to turn the page on Tory chaos by making five ambitious pledges, including cutting NHS waiting lists and “stopping the boats”. He was supposed to be a calm, reassuring figure. Multiple cabinet reshuffles and stunning losses at the ballot box had him, less than a year later, vowing to end the “30-year status quo” in British politics. Voters thought the Tory leader never made good on his promise. In July, he led the Conservatives to the party’s worst-ever election defeat.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"Taxes should target land investors, not farmers | Letters","Readers respond to an impassioned plea for understanding by Clare Wise after the government made farms subject to inheritance taxClare Wise’s emotional representation of the family farm offers an excellent insight into the importance of maintaining generational continuity (My family has grown Britain’s food for 140 years. Here’s what politicians don’t understand about farming, 27 November). She rightly condemns the potentially devastating effects that inheritance tax (IHT) on farmland will have on many family farms. Enforced sales will accelerate the break-up and loss of smaller and medium-sized farms, favouring accumulation of land owned as investments and for tax avoidance.I support IHT and other forms of tax on wealthy estates, investment properties and farmland sold off for development. But this tax is misplaced, introduced without due consultation and pays no attention to the effects it will have on many farming families who will be unable to afford to pay it from farm income. The government needs to listen to the many voices of protest and have the courage to review this tax. Continue reading...","Mon, 02 Dec 2024 17:34:48 GMT",0.0,0.3919

The Guardian,Lucy Letby inquiry: parents expressed ‘intolerable anguish’ at police investigation,"Parents asked bosses at Countess of Chester hospital, where she was a neonatal nurse, for ‘urgent meeting’Lucy Letby’s parents wrote to hospital bosses expressing their “intolerable anguish” after police began investigating their daughter, and asking for an urgent meeting with senior managers, a public inquiry has heard.
 Two months after officers from Cheshire constabulary were brought into the hospital to investigate an increase in the number of baby deaths on the neonatal ward in 2015 and 2016, John and Susan Letby wrote to the Countess of Chester hospital’s then board chair, Sir Duncan Nichol.
 “It is now one year since our nightmare began,” they wrote in an email. “There is a saying ‘innocent until proven guilty’ but it doesn’t seem to apply to Lucy.
 “She is still the only one of all the staff on the neonatal unit to be singled out for punishment.”
 Requesting an “urgent meeting” to discuss matters, they added: “We would appreciate the meeting to be as soon as possible as the anguish this situation is causing has become intolerable.”
 Nichol told the Thirlwall inquiry, sitting at Liverpool town hall and looking into the events surrounding Letby’s crimes, that he did not respond to the email sent on 7 July 2017, which was also sent to the then chief executive, Tony Chambers.
 Letby, a former neonatal nurse who has been convicted of murdering seven infants and attempting to murder seven others, with two attempts on one of her victims, was moved from the unit in July 2016.She was placed in an administrative role in the risk and patient safety department, after consultant paediatricians voiced fears she may have deliberately harmed babies under her care.
 Letby was said to have believed that two consultants, Dr Stephen Brearey and Dr Ravi Jayaram, had “orchestrated a campaign” against her and that some doctors on the unit referred to her publicly as “angel of death”.
 Last week, the inquiry heard that Letby’s father called for the “instant dismissal” of the two consultants when he and his wife, together with Lucy Letby, met Chambers at the hospital in December 2016.
 Giving evidence, Chambers said Letby’s father was “very angry” and was “threatening guns to my head and all sorts of things”.
 In another meeting, Chambers was noted to have told the nurse: “Lucy, don’t worry, we’ve got your back,” but he explained to the inquiry that he wanted to try to avoid further escalation, “particularly from her father”.
 Letby, 34, from Hereford, was sentenced to 15 whole-life orders after she was convicted of the murders and attempted murders between June 2015 and June 2016 at Manchester crown court.
 The public inquiry is expected to sit until early 2025, with the findings published by late autumn next year. Continue reading...","Mon, 02 Dec 2024 16:00:25 GMT",0.0,-0.9914

The Guardian,"Ukraine war briefing: Nato invitation highly unlikely at this stage, say diplomats","Nato foreign ministers to hold likely last meeting before Trump returns to presidency; talk of peace negotiations rumbles on. What we know on day 1,014Nato is highly unlikely to heed Ukraine’s call for a membership invitation at a meeting on Tuesday, diplomats have told the Reuters news agency. “It will take weeks and months to get consensus,” a senior Nato diplomat said on Monday, Reuters reported. “I don’t see that happening tomorrow, I would be very surprised.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, will be in Brussels on Tuesday and Wednesday for the probably last high-level Nato foreign ministers’ meeting before Donald Trump takes over from Joe Biden as president.In a letter to his Nato counterparts ahead of the meeting, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said an invitation would remove one of Russia’s main arguments for waging its war – namely, preventing Ukraine from joining the alliance. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has started pushing in recent days for the free part of Ukraine to be placed under the “Nato umbrella” to end the fighting, saying he would then seek the return of Russian-occupied territory through diplomatic means.The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, said on Monday that stepping up support for Ukraine was essential to put it in the strongest position for peace talks as he conceded in the clearest terms that there could be a negotiated end to the war. “We must continue to back Ukraine and do what it takes to support their self-defence for as long as it takes … to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position for negotiations so they can secure a just and lasting peace on their terms that guarantees their security, independence – and right to choose their own future.” Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker of Russia’s upper legislative house, said on Monday in a pro-Kremlin newspaper that she expects Russian-Ukrainian peace talks next year.The US and Ukrainian defence chiefs on Monday discussed Russia’s use of new ballistic missiles, preparations for the next meeting of arms donors and plans for Washington’s military aid next year, both sides said. The meeting came as the US said it will send Kyiv another $725m of missiles, ammunition, anti-personnel mines and other weapons. The Ukrainian defence minister, Rustem Umerov, said the call also focused on “strategic planning for 2025, particularly regarding the supply of weapons, equipment, and equipping of our units”. Umerov said he and the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, discussed preparations for an upcoming meeting of the Ramstein group, an alliance of Nato, the European Union and countries that have supported Kyiv.A Ukrainian military spokesperson told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that Russia has fired at least 60 North Korean-supplied ballistic missiles during the war. “Their accuracy, in principle, is not very high. We understand that the technology with which they were manufactured is outdated,” said Andrii Cherniak, answering questions about the likelihood of Russia’s use of KN-23 ballistic missiles.Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, warned her Chinese counterpart that Beijing’s support for Moscow would impact ties and instead urged China to help end the war in Ukraine. “The Russian president is not only destroying our European peace order through his war against Ukraine, but is now dragging Asia into it via North Korea,” she told a press briefing. “My Chinese counterpart and I have therefore discussed in depth that this cannot be in China’s interest either.”Officials said on Monday that the latest Russian attacks against Ukraine had killed at least four people and injured about two dozen others across multiple regions.Swiss parliamentarians voted on Monday to significantly restrict access to a special temporary protection status granted to Ukrainians since Russia’s full-scale invasion. The lower house accepted, with 96 votes in favour and 87 opposed, a motion from the hard-right Swiss People’s party (SVP) tightening the requirements for Ukrainians seeking special protection in Switzerland, after a similar vote by the upper house earlier this year. A second motion which passed 120-60, will make it easier to crack down on abuses in the system. Switzerland’s government opposed both motions and has said that it will not lift the status until there is lasting stability in Ukraine, and that it is expected to remain in place until at least March 2026.

An unnamed man and a mute young girl flee pursuers across the blasted landscape of future Western Australia. Looking for refuge in an abandoned mine, they are taken hostage by a stranger armed with a&nbsp;crossbow. The man narrates the story of his life, Scheherazade-style, in an attempt to stop this person killing them both – the tension that builds across this long novel as to whether the strategy will save them is brilliantly worked. As&nbsp;the night unfolds, we get the full scope of what it means to live in a ruined world, learning how the epochs of the past declined from The Hundred Years of Light to The Dirty World and The Terror. The architects of the Earth’s collapse, descendants of the corporate polluters from our time, now live in redoubts and bunkers, and part of the story follows “the Service”, a paramilitary group who hunt them down.

And while major labels such as Elektra sensed commercial potential within OTC’s often brilliant and occasionally baffling acid-pop, record contract negotiations quickly foundered over questions of creative control, which Hart had no intention of relinquishing. “I didn’t want to be rich,” he admitted. “I just wanted to be able to buy more equipment and continue to create cool things.”Such simple ambitions had bonded Hart with dear friends Doss, Robert Schneider and Jeff Mangum back in junior high school in their home town of Ruston, Louisiana. Hart’s parents, both interior designers, had encouraged their son’s precocious artistic leanings – his mother kept him stocked with reams of paper to scrawl on. But music became his chief focus after Schneider, his “mentor”, introduced him to lo-fi home-recording. “When we realised the Beatles made their records on four-track tape-recorders, it changed our lives,” Hart said.

When I took it out of the washing machine and realised it should never have been in there in the first place – and that, as a result, it looked like something my toddler might wear – I felt angry and disappointed with myself for my mistake. But this soon transformed into elation when, after giving it a bit of a stretch, I found not only that it still fitted, but that it did so like a glove.In shrinking, the fabric has transformed. Previously a lightweight spring number, the jumper has become a tightly woven, thermal-style top that keeps me toasty, letting no air in or out and giving very little, like a woollen wetsuit. In it, I am impervious to the cold – I don’t even need a coat. Wearing it feels like receiving a tight hug, which, in these dark days, is exactly what I want.

In a few weeks, it’ll be as if it never happened.Ruaridh MacKay, who has been farming here at Stronmagachan Farm in Inveraray for 25 years, picks up one of the spines: sodden and slimy from successive fronts of rain, every morsel of flesh has been excavated. He was expecting to take these lambs to market next month.Mackay says the mysterious deaths started about 12 years ago Continue reading...","Mon, 02 Dec 2024 07:00:17 GMT",-0.6597,0.8591

The Guardian,"‘If I’m sent to Japan, I’m not coming home’: jailed anti-whaler defiant in face of extradition threat","Captain Paul Watson talks about his arrest on behalf of the Japanese government, his ‘interesting’ Greenland prison, and separation from his childrenThe humpback whales watched by Paul Watson from his prison cell this summer have long since migrated from the iceberg-flecked Nuup Kangerlua fjord to warmer seas. It is over four months since Watson – an eco-terrorist to some and a brave environmentalist to others – was brought here to Anstalten, a high-security jail perched on the frozen coast of south-east Greenland after being arrested while refuelling his ship, MV John Paul DeJoria, in nearby Nuuk, the capital of the autonomous Danish territory.He had been on his way with a 32-strong crew to practise his decades-long policy of “non-violent aggression” by intercepting a new Japanese whaling “mothership”, the ¥7.5bn ($47.4m) Kangei Maru. But shortly after tying up his vessel in the harbour “a nice police car turned up” and 12 armed officers boarded. Continue reading...","Sun, 01 Dec 2024 08:00:01 GMT",-0.3964,0.1154
The Guardian,‘I felt like a bystander in my own internal recovery’: one woman’s battle for health after a life-changing diagnosis,"Facing an enormous decision about her health filled Kat Lister with wonder at her body’s ability to fight for herThe 2cm wound to the right of my bellybutton had been oozing for days. A syrupy weep in the well of my abdomen. A surgical pothole so small that it felt almost indulgent to photograph it in my bathroom mirror. As if these tiny keyhole incisions dotted around my swollen stomach – one, two, three, four, five of them – bore no relation to the magnitude of the plunder beneath.Magnitude. Or, should I say: weight. “Do you feel lighter?” a friend asked me a week after I had a total colectomy to save my life. To which I replied (somewhat contradictorily): yes and no. It didn’t take long for my doctors to start referring to my large bowel, laden with more than 400 precancerous polyps, as a “heavy burden” – and I think there is something poetic in that choice of words. A flash of humanity in an otherwise sterile place. Which is where I found myself in May last year, staring numbly at pictures of stoma bags in St Mark’s hospital in north-west London, the only hospital in the world to specialise entirely in intestinal and colorectal medicine.

The Guardian,New Zealand: the fight to protect Māori rights – podcast,"In what could be the biggest protest march in New Zealand’s history, 42,000 people took to the roads over fears Māori rights are being dismantled. Eva Corlett reportsIt started at the northern tip of the North Island, gathering momentum as it moved its way down the country. By the time the march – or hikoi – reached its conclusion nine days later outside parliament in Wellington it was thought to be one of the biggest New Zealand has ever seen, with 42,000 people taking part. The demonstration was sparked by what critics say is the rightwing government’s attempt to fundamentally redraw the relationship between the Māori people and the state.A lawyer and activist Annette Sykes, who was on the march, says it was a unifying moment for Māori people, but also showed the strength of public feeling against a potential rollback of hard-won rights. She says she feels the new ruling coalition is coming up with divisive policies that “are actually trying to demolish that sense of unity that we have forged as a nation, that mutual respect”.

But it's not just in the US, some governments in other countries have launched marketing campaigns encouraging people to have more children, while others have offered financial incentives. But while many of these policies claim to be about halting population decline, there are other factors at play.

The Minneapolis-based artist and writer’s bright watercolour vignettes of city life have now been collected into an expanded edition of the illustrated memoir he first published in 2015. “Paris is special in winter because there are fewer tourists and the city is more intimate, more itself,” he says. “Dinners are elaborate. And Parisian fashion is at its height – people wear beautiful layered clothes.” In addition to his wife, Wendy, and their children David and Sarah, Coggins enjoys painting “the witty, romantic life of Parisians. A waiter in a long white apron having a smoke break, a dog sporting a Chanel sweater, a woman wearing an umbrella hat.”Paris in Winter: An Illustrated Memoir by David Coggins is published by powerHouse Books Continue reading...","Sat, 30 Nov 2024 17:00:31 GMT",0.3612,0.967
