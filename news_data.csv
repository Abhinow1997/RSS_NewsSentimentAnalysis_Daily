Finally, the last stage of this epic 30-year journey had begun, a moment that he never wanted to arrive but had no choice but to face.

The Guardian,Wicked review – Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande are a blast in sugar-rush Wizard of Oz fantasy,"Stephen Schwartz’s musical prequel has been brought to the big screen, with Erivo’s charismatic Elphaba exerting a planetary pull over a star-studded castAs Kermit the Frog and the Hulk discovered: it’s not easy being green. Now another verdant character is gleefully brought to the screen by lyricist-producer Stephen Schwartz, screenwriters Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox, and director Jon M Chu in an adaptation of Schwartz’s Broadway musical, the first of two parts. It’s a sugar-rush fantasy with the overpowering star presence of Cynthia Erivo; it basically dunks you face-down in a hyperreal ball pit of M&amp;Ms for two and three-quarter hours. I don’t have showtune-rapture in my DNA but this movie made a cleaner, sharper, cartoonier kind of sense to me than the stage show which I saw back in 2011.This film is the prequel origin myth for Schwartz’s emerald supervillain-hero, stratospherically upping her status in retrospect: the green-faced Wicked Witch of the West from the 1939 movie classic The Wizard of Oz, based on L Frank Baum’s children’s tale. It was a character shriekingly played in the original by Margaret Hamilton, terrorising Judy Garland’s Dorothy, and now we are given a backstory for the pointy hat, the broom-transportation, the inky cloak (though shrouding the protagonist’s biological father in mystery). It pulls off the cheeky trick of making us interested in someone we know is destined for an ignominious death by water. Continue reading...","Tue, 19 Nov 2024 20:00:16 GMT",-0.5267,-0.7143

The Guardian,The Listeners review – Rebecca Hall’s hauntingly delicate drama will paralyse you with dread,"What if no one believed what you knew to be true? Jordan Tannahill’s nuanced thriller about a woman who starts hearing a mysterious noise keeps you constantly off balanceThe question of what you would do if no one believed you is one of the most haunting there is. Believe you about what? Doesn’t matter. What happens if you feel a thing, know a thing or are having a thing happen to you, and you tell people – and no one takes you seriously?That is the terrifying question at the heart of the four-part drama The Listeners, adapted by Jordan Tannahill from his book of the same name. The action is moved from the US to the UK, and Rebecca Hall (with a short haircut to allow for the ear-acting involved – you’ll see) plays Claire, a busy wife, mother, friend and a charismatic teacher of literature to teenagers at the local school. Then she, and she (apparently) alone, starts hearing a low, torturous, rumbling hum – from somewhere outside herself. She proves this by putting her fingers in her ears, whereupon it disappears. Her husband, Paul (Prasanna Puwanarajah), suggests tinnitus and doctors can find no physical cause. Continue reading...","Tue, 19 Nov 2024 21:45:18 GMT",-0.4215,-0.8415

The Guardian,Cheaters season two review – this romcom is so convincing it’ll worm its way into your heart,"It’s the difficult second series for the comedy filled with graphic sex and kink exploration. Luckily, it breezes through it by being as impeccably well-observed as everThere are hordes of romcoms that could feasibly be renamed Cheaters. Despite the spicy frankness of this dramedy’s title, its premise – Cupid strikes while at least one of the pairing is in a relationship – isn’t actually a novel, modern twist on the format; it’s one of the founding principles of the genre. From Brief Encounter to Sleepless in Seattle to Bridget Jones’s Diary, unfaithfulness is the bedrock of many an enthralling love story.Cheaters is no exception. The first season, released in 2022, was a wildly entertaining romp that hinged on a classic romcom coincidence: having indulged in a passionate one-night stand in Finland, Josh (Joshua McGuire) and Fola (Susan Wokoma) returned to their respective homes and partners – only to find that both of these things were situated directly across the road from one another in south-east London. Nightmarish weeks spent wrestling with guilt and intensifying attraction followed, as their unsuspecting other halves struck up a friendship and the two couples’ lives became increasingly intertwined.

It’s essential to them feeling at home in their bodies.Top surgery is a form of gender-affirming healthcare that can be used to treat dysphoria, the sense of deep unease one feels when their identity or appearance doesn’t match up with the gender they were assigned at birth. It’s also a complicated, intense and invasive process that requires navigating a maze of insurance paperwork, and from which it can take years to heal. This means that the road to achieving one’s “dream” chest can be a long, complex and fluid journey. Continue reading...","Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:00:13 GMT",0.2023,0.6908
The Guardian,"‘There was three of them waiting, like: play this track or else’: DJ EZ, the reality-bending maestro of the decks","The staunch champion of garage is one of the UK’s most talented musicians, manipulating tracks at lightning speed. In a rare interview he discusses neurodiversity, being teetotal – and the truth about his feesOne day around the turn of the millennium DJ EZ turned up for his regular slot at Kiss FM. His career was taking off in earnest, in line with his reputation as a technically gifted mixer and linchpin of the UK garage scene. He was among the first DJs to play Daniel Bedingfield’s Gotta Get Thru This on the radio, shortly before it topped the UK singles chart and earned Bedingfield a Grammy nomination, and his Midas touch was now hotly sought after, sometimes to a frightening degree. As he arrived at Kiss HQ he saw some familiar faces – musicians he says we’d all recognise today – wearing a threatening look. “There was three or four of them waiting,” he says. “Like: ‘Here’s my track. Play it today. Or else.’”EZ played the song (“Had to!”), survived, and 20 years later some consider him the finest DJ in the UK. He throws everything into the pot, remixing tracks in front of your eyes and creating new ones in real time. Snippets of classics appear out of thin air, sometimes several within a minute. Most DJs play crowdpleasers, but EZ craves pandemonium with every drop, and invariably gets it. His sets are feats of not just dexterity but also endurance: in livestreamed charity events he has DJ’d for eight, 12 and 24 hours at a time. “EZ is God,” says dubstep pioneer Skream. “I literally learned how to mix copying his old tapes when I was like 11 or 12 – I’d copy them mix for mix.” Continue reading...","Tue, 19 Nov 2024 13:00:49 GMT",0.5994,0.9751
The Guardian,‘A road trip like no other’: my epic drive on Kraftwerk’s Autobahn,"Fifty years ago, the electronic pioneers released a 23-minute song about a road – and changed pop music for ever. Our writer hits the speed-limit-free highways of Düsseldorf and Hamburg in search of its futuristic brillianceAsk people what the most iconic musical road trip is and they’ll most likely direct you towards America: take Highway 61 through the birthplace of the blues, they’ll say, or head to California on Route 66. They may even mention vintage T-Birds or Cadillacs. Yet there’s a road trip arguably more important to the history of popular music than any other, one that tells its story not just via the cities it visits but through the sounds of the journey itself – and the hum of the engine that’s powering you. And the best way to ride it is in a humble Volkswagen.Fifty years ago this month, Kraftwerk released Autobahn, a 22-minute 43-second song about the German road network. Astonishingly for a 22-minute 43-second song about the German road network, it somehow managed to change the musical landscape forever. Indeed, look back at the soundtrack to the last few decades – with its abundance of pristine synths, robotic vocoders and repetitive beats – and you’d be hard pressed to find a road that doesn’t somehow lead back to Autobahn.

Not only is the man desperate for people to laugh at his crass jokes, he reportedly has a weird habit of trying to donate his sperm at every opportunity – including, according to an October New York Times report, an incident where he offered some spermatozoa, as casually as you might pass the salt, to a married couple “he had met socially only a handful of times” during a Silicon Valley dinner party.Musk has denied offering sperm to strangers over supper. But it would be in keeping with his creepy breeding fetish: Musk is desperate for people in developed countries to have more children and has himself fathered at least 12 children with three women. (One of the children has since sadly died.) He’s become one of the most famous faces of a growing pro-natalist movement – one with an unsettling overlap with eugenics and deeply misogynistic ideas.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Retailers deserve a break – but they shouldn’t look to the chancellor for one,"A letter by 79 firms voicing ‘significant concerns’ over the budget is likely to do little more than irritate Rachel ReevesWhile the farmers took to the streets of Westminster, the shopkeepers protested in the old-fashioned way. They wrote a polite letter to the chancellor voicing their “significant concerns” over “the sheer scale” of budget measures that, they say, will push up their industry’s costs by £7bn next year and “make job losses inevitable and higher prices a certainty”. A total of 79 firms signed, including all the FTSE 100 crew – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Next, Marks &amp; Spencer, B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher, JD Sports and the AB Foods-owned Primark.This display of unity will irritate the Treasury but, almost certainly, will not cause Rachel Reeves to rethink. The chancellor has already told firms how to deal with the rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs), the most contentious measure and one that comprises £2.33bn of the £7bn. They should absorb it through “lower profits or perhaps through lower wage growth”, she has said. Continue reading...","Tue, 19 Nov 2024 18:38:06 GMT",0.0,-0.4654
The Guardian,What we’ve learned in the five years since our first environment pledge,"An update on our progress from the Guardian’s head of sustainabilityThe Guardian environment pledge 2024Support urgent, independent climate journalism todayFive years ago the Guardian made a pledge that we would “play a part, both in our journalism and in our own organisation, to address the climate emergency” with our first annual environment pledge. That commitment reflected our long history of environment reporting and our view that individual companies had to take greater responsibility for their impact on the natural world. We wanted to demonstrate to readers that we were taking the action that our journalism showed was so necessary, and to be transparent about our progress. Today we publish the 2024 pledge.Since then we have worked hard to measure and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, to understand our impact on nature and to share our results openly with readers. In our latest sustainability report, published last month, we show that our emissions have fallen by 43% since 2020, putting us well on track to achieve our goal of a 67% cut by 2030.

The Guardian,"760,000 women in the UK waiting for a gynaecological appointment? That’s just the tip of the iceberg | Zoe Williams","A broken NHS makes life worse for everyone. What happened to the dream of promoting ‘good health in all citizens’?The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has landed on an arresting image to illustrate the waiting-list crisis in its field. If all 760,000 women waiting for NHS gynaecological appointments were to stand in a line, the queue would go from London to Exeter. It’s great for visualisation, but it also rams home what a criminal waste of human energy this represents – the awful pressing interminability. I couldn’t face the queue for Kew Gardens now, let alone if I were in constant pain.Given this, plus a crisis in maternity care – nearly half of all services last year were marked as inadequate or in need of improvement – you could make a solid case that it is women who suffer most when the health service is underfunded. But I have to mention the guy in my local car-hire place. I rent a car only to go to one place (Ramsgate, thank you for asking) and I go only in alternate school holidays, so a bit less than once a quarter. Every time I have been this year, he has been back on the waiting list for an operation that got cancelled at the last minute. The system is not working for anyone.

The Guardian,Why Kamala Harris couldn’t convince an anti-establishment America | Samuel Hammond,"This election was a referendum on America’s political establishment. And Harris was firmly on the side of the establishment Two weeks have passed, and Kamala Harris’s convincing electoral defeat still has Democrats pointing fingers at who – or what – to blame. If only Biden had dropped out sooner. If only Harris had picked a different running mate. If only she went on Joe Rogan’s podcast. If only, if only, if only.There is an obvious reason for the lack of consensus. From failing to defend Biden’s record on inflation and immigration to being perceived as too leftwing, Harris’s loss was in some sense wildly overdetermined. And while Democrats were quick to attribute Trump’s victory in 2016 to white racial resentment, that’s a harder story to tell against the backdrop of Republican’s sizable gains among Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native American voters.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on taxing farmers: big landowners must pay their share | Editorial,"Tax rises were needed, but Labour must not dismiss the difficulties faced by farming familiesNo tax change is perfect. Systems can never be customised to take in every set of circumstances. There&nbsp;are always edge cases – people who are outliers&nbsp;in the groups that new measures are aimed at. Several hundred farming families seem likely to fall into this category, following the changes to inheritance&nbsp;tax in Rachel Reeves’s budget that have prompted this week’s angry protests. Those whose incomes will make it difficult for them to pay the new 20% rate on agricultural property above a £1m threshold may need to sell land, or adapt their businesses in other ways.Given that farms were previously exempt, it is not surprising that this has caused upset. Very few people want to pay more tax – especially on family-owned assets to which they are attached. There is a reasonable argument that more notice should have been given of the government’s plans, which were not in its manifesto. Had a consultation taken place it is possible that the £1m threshold might have been set higher, given the average size of a farm.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on a showtrial in Hong Kong: a new authoritarian low | Editorial,"The jailing of 45 pro-democracy activists testifies to the ruthless suppression of a once-vibrant civil societyDefending Beijing’s draconian crackdown on political freedoms in Hong Kong, following the extraordinary protest movement in 2019, the territory’s former leader, Carrie Lim, would claim that there was no “one-size-fits-all” approach to doing democracy. Such rhetoric was, of course, only ever disingenuous sophistry. The conclusion of Hong Kong’s largest-ever national security trial on Tuesday confirmed the grisly trajectory of recent years under Ms Lim’s successor, John Lee: a consolidation of nakedly authoritarian rule has led to the suppression of a once vibrant and politically diverse civil society.In all, 45 pro-democracy activists were jailed under Hong Kong’s punitive national security law (NSL), imposed by Beijing in 2020. Charged the same year with conspiracy to commit subversion against the state, their “crime” had been, in fact, to pursue a peaceful route to goals including democratic elections for the city’s leader and police accountability.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,A war surgeon’s perspective on crimes in Gaza | Letter,"Richard Villar has treated injured people in Gaza and is in no doubt that crimes against humanity are being committed thereI read with interest your article based on the recent report by Human Rights Watch (Israel accused of crimes against humanity over forced displacement in Gaza, 14 November). I am surprised that there is any debate. In my personal and non-legal view, crimes are being committed. I have been a war surgeon in Gaza on three occasions. The first two were for the Great March of Return in 2018, when I was operating in Gaza’s Khan Younis. There, I treated dozens of gunshot wounds to the shinbone (tibia) in men who were aged between 18 and 35. As most doctors will tell you, a shattered shinbone assures a lifetime of disability. It appeared that the intention was to disable, not to kill.I was also in Gaza this year and have written about it in my recent book, Gaza Medic: A War Surgeon’s Story 2024. Most of the multitudinous patients I treated were children, women and elderly people. I never once saw fighters or&nbsp;tunnels, but I did&nbsp;see many families ripped apart and children&nbsp;rendered orphans in&nbsp;a&nbsp;blink.

The Guardian,‘It’s infuriating’: inside the UK’s longest-running pothole dispute,"On a social housing estate in Hertfordshire, hemmed in by mansions, residents have been fighting for 70 years to get someone to repair a cratered stretch of road that causes falls and punctured tyres. Why is it taking so long?The day after Rachel Reeves, in her first budget as chancellor, denounced potholes as a “visible reminder of our failure to invest as a nation”, Sarah Wright is staring at a £73,000 repair bill. The carer, 59, has become something of a celebrity thanks to her Hertfordshire cul-de-sac’s 70-year battle over potholes. “This is not my comfort zone – it makes me feel anxious,” she says of speaking to the press, “but I can do it because I’m doing it for these people. How can I say no?”The people in question are her neighbours on Whitebarns Lane in the sleepy village of Furneux Pelham, where the average house is more than £1m and looks like something out of House &amp; Garden. Unlike the mansions that hem it in, the 1950s cul-de-sac where Wright has lived for 27 years is part social housing. It is also the subject of the UK’s longest-running pothole dispute, with the county council refusing to resurface the stretch of Whitebarns Lane that links its 30-odd homes to village amenities including a primary school, church and bus stop, and residents refusing to resign themselves to a life of punctured tyres and falling in the mud.

The Guardian,"Interior Chinatown review – ambitious, yet tiring, adaptation of Charles Yu’s novel","There's a lot going in this entertaining, yet overstuffed, new series based on the award-winning meta mystery bookThough written in the form of a teleplay, Interior Chinatown, the 2020 National Book Award-winning novel by Charles Yu, is not the most natural fit for the screen. Part surreal exploration of identity, part sendup of Hollywood’s limited view of Asian Americans, it’s a tricky and brilliant balance on the page that doesn’t necessarily translate off it. Yu, a writer for such shows as Westworld and Lodge 49, along with Taika Waititi as executive producer, leads the charge on a dizzyingly circular task: the TV adaptation of his novel in which everyone toils in a TV show. If it sounds too meta, well, that’s both the point and the show’s central flaw – at least, in the first half of 10 episodes made available for critics, which chases its own tail into a criminal conspiracy, TV parody and shows within shows.Yu has changed some of the book’s narrative, but we’re still focused on Willis Wu (Jimmy O Yang), a frustrated waiter at his uncle Wong’s (Archie Kao) restaurant in a Los Angeles-ish Chinatown and a perpetual background actor in Black and White, the Law &amp; Order-spoof crime drama filmed there. Though he dreams of being a kung fu guy like his long-missing older brother (Chris Pang), Willis has only a measly range of options available; at best, as he tells his aimless best friend and co-worker Fatty Choi (Ronny Chieng) in the first scene, if you’re in the first scene of a show, you’re either a victim or a witness.

However, my boyfriend is turned off by period sex, a novel situation for me. I respect his boundaries but I can’t help feeling rejected every month. How do I come to terms with this and not feel rebuffed?Everybody has likes and dislikes concerning sex and bodily functions, and it’s important to respect each other’s feelings about such things. Try not to take this personally. It is something that is ingrained in him and it may be something of a turn-off for many men. After all, since a basic function of sex is reproduction, which is less likely to occur through intercourse during menstruation, his response may to a certain extent be biologically determined.

The Guardian,What’s the best way to cook long-grain rice? | Kitchen aide,"Rinse, soak, drain, rest, says our panel of culinary experts“People are intimidated by cooking rice, because there are many different ways to do it,” says Will Bowlby, chef and co-founder of Kricket in London. “There are no set rules.” That said, he adds, it’s all about ratios, and about handling the rice correctly: “Then it’s pretty straightforward.”Whether we’re talking basmati or another long-grain rice, it’s crucial to rinse it in cold water first, to get rid of its starchy coating: “If too much of that is left behind, it might cause the rice to turn a bit wet and sticky,” Bowlby explains. Once the water is running clear, soak the rice for a little while. However, as the Guardian’s Felicity Cloake found on her quest for the perfect basmati rice, there are differing opinions on how long you should do this for. She tried half an hour, an hour and three hours, only to conclude that: “There’s little to choose between the three soaked grains, but it’s definitely more evenly cooked, and easier to separate than non-soaked, which seems dry and clumpy in comparison”.Got a culinary dilemma?

The Guardian,‘Kindle a fire and enjoy complete solitude’; a magical winter cottage in Cornwall,"Tucked away near Helford River, 19th-century Frenchman’s Creek is rented by the Landmark Trust and offers serenity and cobweb-blasting walksI don’t remember when I first heard about Frenchman’s Creek. Not Daphne du Maurier’s pirate romance, but the house of the same name near the Helford River. An old stone cottage, the colour of clotted cream, that hides in the woods by a burbling stream. Perhaps I dreamed it? I stayed once, one winter, but still sometimes wonder if it actually exists.This corner of Cornwall has that place-out-of-time feel. Unlike the brazen drama of the wave-smacked coast, there’s a peace and a secrecy to the Helford River. Once a bustling highway, now this sinuous passage is left largely to the ancient oaks, the prehistoric herons and the ghosts of smugglers’ ships – the kind that inspired du Maurier, who honeymooned there. This feeling is even more palpable in winter, when the grockles have gone and the ferry – there’s been a crossing at Helford for at least 1,000 years – is anchored for the season.
