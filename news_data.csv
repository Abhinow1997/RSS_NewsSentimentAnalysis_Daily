The Guardian,Middle East crisis live: Israeli military says body of Shiri Bibas is not among returned hostages,"Israel has demanded the return of Shiri Bibas after it said testing showed that one of the four bodies released by Hamas did not belong to any other hostageWe’re pausing our live coverage of the Middle East crisis now – it’s approaching 4.30am in Tel Aviv and Gaza City. You can read all the key developments in our latest full report. Here’s where things stand:One of the four bodies Hamas returned to Israel on Thursday is not that of Shiri Bibas, the Israeli military has said, calling it a “violation of utmost severity” of a ceasefire deal that was already fragile.The Israel Defense Forces confirmed on Friday that two of the bodies belonged to Bibas’ children, Ariel and Kfir, but said that during the identification process it was determined the additional body received was not Shiri Bibas and no match was found for any other hostage. “This is an anonymous, unidentified body,” it said. “We demand that Hamas return Shiri home along with all our hostages.” There was no immediate response from Hamas.Bibas and her children became a symbol of the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023. The militant group has said they were killed in an Israeli airstrike in the early days of the war. However, the IDF said on Friday that they had been murdered in captivity, posting on X: “According to the assessment of professional officials, based on the intelligence available to us and forensic findings from the identification process, Ariel and Kfir Bibas were brutally murdered by terrorists in captivity in November 2023.”The IDF’s statement Friday’s statement came hours after Israeli prime Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the military to conduct an “intense operation” against “terror hubs” in the occupied West Bank after a series of explosions on three parked buses in Bat Yam, a city outside Tel Aviv, that authorities said was a suspected terrorist attack. No injuries were reported.Explosives were found on two other buses but did not detonate, Israeli police said. The five bombs were identical and equipped with timers, and bomb squads were defusing the unexploded bombs, they said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosionsThe IDF said it “was decided to reinforce with three battalions in the Central Command sector” of the West Bank.It is my hope that the peace he worked to see in the region through his charity work and activism will be achieved.

From next month, alongside eggs and loo roll, bridesmaids-to-be doing the weekly shop at Asda can pick up a dress with the launch of its first bridesmaid range. Available in sizes UK8 to 24, the collection starts at £24 for a satin halterneck dress. The retail giant says the launch was prompted by demand from consumers with searches for bridesmaid dresses up 69% year on year.While most people are thrilled to be a bridesmaid, the excitement can be somewhat diminished by the cost involved. Social media is rife with bridesmaid horror stories of what brides have expected their friends to pick up the costs for. My own quick straw poll found dozens of tales of brides dictating what bridesmaids could wear. Even though it wasn’t something the bridesmaid wanted to wear or would wear again, they were expected to cover the costly bill. The expense is often in addition to hen parties followed by travel, accommodation, hair and makeup for the wedding itself. Continue reading...","Thu, 20 Feb 2025 17:00:13 GMT",0.4019,0.7136

Ratings are in freefall; once the most watched thing on TV, these days the soap is lucky if it cracks the top 20. But an anniversary like this gives EastEnders an opportunity to not only celebrate itself, but to reaffirm its own mission statement. And it has gone about this by going on an absolute tear.With little else to lose, EastEnders has spent the last few weeks wildly swinging for the fences. Don’t mistake this for hyperbole, either. Just look at last Thursday’s episode where – and I promise I’m not making any of this up – Phil Mitchell embarked on a long monologue about all the different things he’s survived (alcoholism, drug addiction, illness, heart attacks, an actual shooting), then travelled back in time and murdered a younger version of himself, before the ghost of his dead mother arrived and urged him to kill himself. It was utterly bizarre, but it was also incredible. Had a big budget streaming show attempted something this daring, it would be lauded to the heavens. But this is old workday EastEnders, and so the whole thing passed without comment.EastEnders Live aired on BBC One and is available on iPlayer.

In the south, some countries are many, many times richer than their neighbours. A climate difference?

Instead, the debate has largely focused on how to revive the ailing German economy after two years of recession and how to control migration, which has fuelled support for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland.The conservative CDU/CSU leader, Friedrich Merz, has swerved speaking about the need for massive borrowing to pay for a surge in defence spending because many of his supporters oppose extra debt. The Social Democratic (SPD) chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is dodging discussion of sending German troops to Ukraine as part of a possible European security force if a ceasefire agreement is reached because part of his political base is either anti-militarist or Russia-friendly.

The Guardian,Hold your breath and look to Germany: its election could decide the fate of Europe – and the UK | Martin Kettle,"If the country holds out against the Trump-assisted AfD, it shows rightwing populism can be resisted in Europe’s heartlandEven in less stressed times, Britain always pays too much attention to the US and too little to Germany. In today’s torrid circumstances, that imbalance is perhaps excusable. After all, Donald Trump, it now turns out, really means it. He is more interested in US plunder and profit from places like Gaza, Ukraine and Greenland than in upholding a just peace or good order.Even so, the inattention towards Germany needs to end. Britain’s politicians, like German politicians, are rewiring their worldviews amid a political gale. But Germany, though no longer a great power, is nevertheless a great nation. Indeed, it may be more than ever the essential European nation now, after the Trump administration’s very public trashing of the entire Atlantic alliance seemed to leave Europe to its own devices.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Gaza’s future: the ceasefire and hostage deal must not fizzle out | Editorial,"As Donald Trump persists with a monstrous proposal to remove Palestinians, the immediate need is to prevent fresh conflictThe pain and damage wreaked in the last 16 months will reverberate through families, communities and the Middle East for decades to come. On Thursday, the bodies of two young children and their mother, and that of an 83-year-old peace activist, were returned to Israel by Hamas. They were kidnapped in&nbsp;the 7&nbsp;October 2023 raid in which the militants killed&nbsp;around 1,200 Israelis and others. Around 48,000&nbsp;Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its war&nbsp;in&nbsp;response.It was always feared that the ceasefire deal, which has brought desperately needed respite for Palestinians in Gaza and the return of Israeli and foreign hostages, would be fleeting. The six-week opening stage is due to expire on 1 March. The talks on the more complicated second stage have yet to begin, more than a fortnight after they were due.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Scottish Labour: a defining moment for Anas Sarwar | Editorial,"After a spectacular general election win, Keir Starmer’s party is struggling to repeat its success in the approaching Holyrood contest​Only a few months ago, Labour won the most votes and a majority of seats in Scotland for the first time since 2010. A 16-point swing from the Scottish National party yielded a harvest of 37 Westminster Labour MPs. The SNP, which had changed leaders twice in little over a year, plummeted from 48&nbsp;Westminster MPs to a mere nine.Yet if anyone assumes Labour is now in the driving seat of Scottish electoral politics again, they have not been paying attention. A poll last week showed Labour facing its worst Holyrood election result since devolution began, with only 18% of Scots planning to vote for Anas Sarwar’s party when the Scottish parliament comes up for election in 2026. The SNP, meanwhile, is on course to be the largest party at Holyrood again, potentially enabling the current first minister, John Swinney, to form the nationalists’ fifth consecutive devolved administration.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We’re thinking about how to earn a living and pay the rent. Nobody, that is, except the chancellor, for whom “growth is the No 1 mission” that “underpins&nbsp;everything else” –&nbsp;schools, hospitals, net zero.Yet decades of growth since the 1960s have left us with thousands of food banks and facing an environmental abyss.

The Guardian,Why Conclave should win the best picture Oscar,"Sturdy, classic storytelling and a peerless cast led by Ralph Fiennes’s anxious cardinal make this drama of Vatican intrigue a solid betCould it? Would it? Until it picked up best film at the Bafta awards, no one had really been taking this papal intrigue drama all that seriously – all the smart money was on one of two very American films: Anora and The Brutalist. (Even more so after Emilia Pérez’s spectacular Karla Sofía Gascón-related blow-out.) But could Conclave pull off a Green Book-style surge to the line, getting past more fashionable and/or artsy efforts through the virtues of sturdy, muscular storytelling?For this is surely the basis of Conclave’s appeal to Oscar voters. Although blessed by brilliant, subtle performances (courtesy of Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, Isabella Rossellini and John Lithgow among others), and handsomely mounted design and camerawork, Conclave’s great strength is its narrative furniture, a build-out of the microcosm that is the papal court. It has a head start, of course, in its source material: Robert Harris has to be the king of the issue-based suspense novel, and the practised ease of the storytelling is the ballast that keeps the film afloat. (Harris’s screen-adaptation ratio is remarkable, from Fatherland and Enigma back in the day, to the Polanski-directed projects The Ghost and An Officer and a Spy.)

We rate his greatest movies, from Straw Dogs to The Wild BunchAfter making his name as a director of westerns, Sam Peckinpah was given his first shot at making a major studio film – an epic about a tyrannical cavalry officer (Charlton Heston) leading an expedition into Mexico. The production set a template for later Peckinpah films – heavy drinking, personality clashes, battles with the suits, and a final cut not matching the director’s vision. Major Dundee was a victim of its chaotic ambition and it’s easy to see why it flopped on release: even in the 2005 restored version, it is hopelessly unfocused, taking in Dundee’s Moby-Dick-like mission to track down an Apache chief, the dynamics of the US civil war, encounters with the French army and an unconvincing romantic interlude. But it’s interestingly flawed, a sort of dry run for The Wild Bunch, and Richard Harris is entertaining as Benjamin Tyreen, the Irishman who leads the Confederate prisoners in Dundee’s ragtag army.

The Guardian,Sam Fender: People Watching review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week,"(Polydor)On his third album, produced by the War on Drugs, the North Shields singer-songwriter shows just how gifted he is at pairing stadium choruses with sharp, bleak vignettesSam Fender’s third album ends with a track called Remember My Name. It’s clearly a very personal song, about its author’s late grandfather – even revealing the address of his council house, 11 Wark Avenue. The northern British references – “Chasing a cross in from the wing / Our boy’s a whippet, he’s faster than anything” – are amplified both by Fender’s Geordie vowels and the backing, provided by the Easington Colliery brass band. It’s all very specific and individual – you really don’t hear brass bands, or indeed the mention of whippets in pop very often – and yet Remember My Name seems to have something of the self-fulfilling prophecy about it. You can immediately imagine its soaring melody being sung en masse by a huge festival audience, which is, one suspects, precisely the destiny that awaits it.It’s a reminder of the singularity of Fender’s rise. Both his 2019 debut Hypersonic Missiles and 2021’s Seventeen Going Under went platinum; the latter’s title track sold nearly 2m copies in the UK. He’s just announced a run of vast summer gigs, taking in the London Stadium and three consecutive nights at Newcastle’s St James’ Park: four shows that will see him play to the best part of quarter of a million people. This has happened despite the fact that his music is expressly political, and not in the usual platitudinous box-ticking way. It relentlessly picks away at the bleakest realities of northern working-class life, seldom a fashionable cause: you’d probably have to look back to Design for Life-era Manic Street Preachers – or even further, to the heyday of the Jam – to find rock musicians who made a similar agenda so commercially successful. He is probably the only pop star to have attracted both the praise of august socialist magazine the Tribune for his critiques of “the callousness of British neoliberalism” and the TikTok hashtag #toptierindiebois.

As with other staples – denim, T-shirts, tailoring et al – it’s an investment that will go beyond any trend or season. So, if you buy the right pieces, you’ll likely wear them for years to come.With that in mind, there are a few things to consider when hitting the shops. Above all, it’s best to choose jumpers you know are made well, using good fabrics. That means you should go for brands you can trust in terms of craftsmanship and stick to natural fibres, such as cotton, wool and cashmere. Unlike human-made textiles, these are naturally breathable and temperature-regulating so they’re more comfortable and better for your skin. This sometimes means the price is a little higher than a fast-fashion buy, but they tend to last longer – just be sure to keep them protected when moth season hits.

The Guardian,"Giants, saints and dragons on the Llŷn peninsula in north Wales","Three walks along the Wales Coast Path offer a fascinating insight into the legends, culture and industry that shaped this stunning outpostThe Llŷn peninsula projects a Tolkienesque mystique as you view it from Cardigan Bay. On a clear day, its jagged, alluring and yet foreboding topography – stretching outward into the Irish Sea – is easily visible from as far south as Aberystwyth. No wonder it was chosen as the location for the recent House of the Dragon Game of Thrones spin-off series. It’s also been my constant backdrop for the past few days as I walk the Wales Coast Path exploring the relationship of the people of this land to the sea – how it has shaped society, how humanity has tried to tame it and how the sea will inevitably prevail.Now, having reached Porthmadog (a town built on reclaimed sand from the Glaslyn estuary), I’m ready to experience the entrancing, wild-looking beauty of the Llŷn up close. I have three walks planned over the coming days. The first is a gentle six-mile stroll from Borth-y-Gest (one bay over from Porthmadog) to Criccieth Castle. As I set out, the tide is retreating at a rate that makes me think someone has pulled the plug on the entire estuary.

How can I persuade my lover that this is a problem?I’ve been dating a man whose 18-year-old kid lives with him full-time. My partner and I are very intimate and I always thought that I kept my cries of passion down by screaming into a pillow. Recently, his kid began slamming doors and cupboards very loudly to let us know that they had heard us. I told my partner that I felt bad, but he said he didn’t think I was being loud and that he had already explained to his kid when they chose to live with him full-time that this would happen. I don’t have the best relationship with his kid because I very rarely spend any time with them, and they are quite introverted. What’s more, recently they were avoiding eye contact with me and seemed uncomfortable. Now, I’m afraid that I’ve made them unhappy by simply being there. I don’t spend very much time with the man I’m dating, which I think sends a signal to his kid that I’m mostly a sexual partner (I would like more but am afraid of asking for it for fear of being turned down).

For almost a decade, I unlocked cells in residential blocks, healthcare units, first night centres, close supervision centres and segregation units. The twist and click of a key in the lock came to feel like background noise to me. But there are some occasions I remember more vividly than others. Sometimes the person inside wasn’t so keen on coming out.One of those challenging incidents took place a few years ago, while I was on shift in a segregation unit in a busy London jail. Prisoners are sent to the seg for a variety of reasons – fights, assaults on staff, possession of contraband – but normally for no longer than a week or two. The seg was made up of 18 single cells spread over two storeys. I was in a team of six, all of us in full riot gear. We were moving a mentally ill prisoner who had destroyed his cell and then flooded it with sewage because he believed we were planning to implant a chip in his brain.
