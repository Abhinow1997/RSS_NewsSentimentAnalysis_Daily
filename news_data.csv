The poll lead on which Starmer’s majority was built has already all but vanished, leaving Labour in a three-way dogfight with the Conservatives and Nigel Farage’s resurgent Reform UK, while, further down, both the Greens and Liberal Democrats have also made gains.Voters have historically given new governments the benefit of the doubt, with most holding their ground or gaining support in their first six months. Blair’s first two new Labour governments enjoyed polling honeymoons. Starmer has had no such luck. Labour’s seven-point decline since the election has been exceeded only once in the past four decades – by the Conservatives’ eight-point fall in the wake of “Black Wednesday” in 1992. Starmer’s early approval ratings are also worse than any PM at this stage except Major after the ERM (Exchange Rate Mechanism) crisis.

Over the past 60 years, his critical and commercial appeal has fluctuated, but in the 21st century his acclaim has steadily increased in an unusual way for an ageing musician, capped with winning the 2016 Nobel prize in literature.More surprisingly, he’s become hip again, not just with long-term followers but with younger listeners, many adding his music to their playlists for the first time. And he has recaptured the zeitgeist via the most unlikely of means for an enigmatic, grouchy eightysomething: taking up posting on X as others abandon it, and endorsing a biopic, A Complete Unknown, that celebrates the first few years of his career, and conceding – as he has rarely done before – that his past might be as important as his present or future.

The Guardian,Tuchel’s notebook: what England’s head coach may have learned at Tottenham,"Newcastle duo catch the eye in first Premier League game Thomas Tuchel has attended since contract officially startedIt didn’t take long for the Thomas Tuchel effect to be felt. By the time six minutes had been played at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium under the – seemingly quite grumpy – eye of the new England head coach, two English players had scored with excellent finishes, Dominic Solanke with a plunging header and Anthony Gordon with a calm angled shot. If there were concerns about Gordon’s positioning for Solanke’s goal, they could be excused in the context of a generally excellent defensive performance from Newcastle.Nine of the starters were England-qualified, even with James Maddison on the bench. Of most interest to Tuchel, perhaps, would have been a Newcastle pairing with which he is already familiar. It was Tuchel who gave Lewis Hall his full Chelsea debut, starting him on the left of a back three in a 5-1 FA Cup win over Chesterfield in 2022. Later that year, around a month before Tuchel was sacked, Chelsea had a £40m bid for Gordon rejected by Everton. Newcastle’s left flank is the left side Chelsea could have had and the left side England might favour in the future. Continue reading...","Sat, 04 Jan 2025 16:11:14 GMT",0.0,0.9577

The Guardian,"Learning to swim as an adult is terrifying, embarrassing and wonderful | Alexandra Hansen","Swimming has become addictive – the euphoria of being in the water, of overcoming a fear I never expected to overcomeMore summer essentialsI don’t know if I’ve always been afraid of water, but I don’t remember a time when I wasn’t. I remember as a child sitting next to the bath to watch it fill lest it flood the house if we stepped away while the tap was still running. I’d had no bad experiences (that I could remember); my fear seemed innate.Like most Australians, I had swimming lessons in primary school. One of the first tasks was to submerge your face and head in the water, and I flat-out refused. The instructor told me that if I didn’t I would have to stay in the first lane with the little kids doing water play. I said that was fine, and she left me alone after that. So I never learned to swim. Continue reading...","Sat, 04 Jan 2025 19:00:03 GMT",-0.3818,0.0065
The Guardian,The Observer view on calls for a national inquiry into child sexual abuse,"The government’s most urgent priority is not to launch another review but  to develop a societal strategy to tackle the crimeJust over a decade ago, with the publication of an independent inquiry, Britain confronted the horror of the sexual abuse of children that had taken place in Rotherham over 16 years by organised gangs of men, mostly of Pakistani origin. The 2014 report conservatively estimated that 1,400 children – some as young as 11, many in the care of the state – were raped, abducted and sexually abused in Rotherham by groups of men. Since then, there have been many other reviews and inquiries in other towns and cities where children have been subjected to similar abuse by organised groups of men, including in Rochdale, Oxford, Telford and Bristol.Together, these reviews paint a dreadful picture of how child victims of sexual abuse were not only routinely ignored by those whose job it was to protect them – including social workers and the police – but how young girls were viewed by child protection authorities as complicit in their own rape and abuse, as if it were something they could consent to. A further 2015 review into Rotherham led by Louise Casey was also clear that these abusers could hide behind their race to perpetrate their abuse: she uncovered what she called an “archaic culture of sexism, bullying and discomfort around race”, with councillors and staff fearing being labelled racist if they mentioned the ethnicity of perpetrators. In suppressing an issue that should have been dealt with openly and properly, this was a factor in enabling the abuse to go on. Continue reading...","Sat, 04 Jan 2025 18:00:55 GMT",-0.6369,-0.9981
The Guardian,"The Observer view on the New Orleans attack: lone terrorist threat calls for wisdom, not divisive rhetoric | Observer editorial","Donald Trump blaming immigration will do nothing to counter the pernicious and lethal online influence posed by ISThe FBI says the man who drove a speeding truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street, New Orleans, early on New Year’s Day, killing 14 people, acted alone. Bureau officials also believe they know the man’s motive. Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, an American citizen from Texas who served eight years in the US army, some of it in Afghanistan, was “100% inspired” by Islamic State, said Christopher Raia of the FBI’s counter-terrorism division. An IS flag was affixed to his rented Ford pickup, Raia said.What is less clear is why Jabbar came to so closely identify with the extremist Sunni Muslim terrorist organisation that seized Mosul in 2014. Under Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s leadership, IS created a so-called caliphate in parts of Iraq and war-torn Syria. It became notorious for public executions, kidnappings and sexual enslavement. Baghdadi was killed in 2019. His followers were jailed and the caliphate smashed. But the IS brand was not.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"Crime is falling, but heists that make headlines imply otherwise","A burglary in London has triggered a press frenzy but the real story is that today such incidents are rareCrime stories serve up a reliable set of emotions – shock, sympathy, horror, outrage, morbid curiosity and fear. But there is something different, I think, about news of a heist. Against your will, in the crime pages of all places, you suddenly find yourself rooting for the villain. The ingenuity! The skill! The sheer improbability that one semi-retired cat burglar could shimmy up a drainpipe in full view of five sleeping XL bullies and still escape with the loot. Will he get away with it? Should he? You’re no longer reading an airport thriller, but a novel of deep moral complexity.Let us turn, for example, to the recent heist in Primrose Hill, north London, over which the media has been in a frenzy. More than £10m worth of jewellery and £150,000 of designer handbags were nicked in one swoop from the house of a Hong Kong socialite, in shenanigans involving the roof, a blowtorch, a crawl along a concrete gutter, near misses with a live-in governess, and the ability to climb on to a sink without disturbing a single cosmetic product scattered about the rim. In a BBC article displaying footage of the burglar at work, a family spokesperson actually described him as moving “like a cat”. In any case, the “hunt” for the suspect (how exciting) is on.

The Guardian,"In life, David Lodge was surprisingly mirthless. Luckily, his wife was a hoot | Rachel Cooke","A delightful but decidedly unfunny encounter with the author led to a train of thought about his comic booksWhen I was a teenager, David Lodge, who died last week at the age of 89, meant more to me than any other writer. It wasn’t only that his novels were so wildly entertaining and funny. My parents had been born into the optimistic but class-ridden postwar world he caught with such precision, and for this reason I saw his tales of campus life as helpful guides to the more baffling aspects of adult behaviour.There was no getting away from the fact that my father, a university lecturer, had an amazing amount in common with both conformist Philip Swallow and randy Morris Zapp, the two professors who enjoy a transatlantic exchange in Changing Places (the first of a trilogy set in Rummidge, a city modelled on Birmingham, where Lodge both lived and taught).

You’re logging into your bank or another service (Gmail, to name just one) that you use regularly.

It’s called “two factor authentication” (2FA) and it passes for best practice in our networked world, given that passwords and login details can easily be cracked.Sadly, our world is wicked as well as networked, and that SMS message can be redirected to someone else’s phone – that of the criminal who has logged in using your phished personal details – and who is now busily emptying your current account.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on a carbon-free economy: no just transition in sight – yet,"Factory closures highlight the turbulent shift to a green economy, exposing political challenges and the urgent need for a equitable move to net zeroOne of the biggest political battles of the future began to take shape in 2024, yet it did not centre on Westminster. Instead, try Grangemouth in central Scotland, Port Talbot in south Wales and Luton in the south of England. Their stories were not front-page staples, but each was of huge significance – locally, nationally and&nbsp;economically.Grangemouth is Scotland’s sole oil refinery, whose owners confirmed in September that it would shut, to be replaced by a terminal taking in imported fuel – with&nbsp;nearly 400 workers losing their jobs. In the last&nbsp;days of September, the only remaining blast&nbsp;furnace&nbsp;at Port Talbot was shut down, as part of a restructuring that will cost 2,800 employees their jobs. At the end of November, staff at Vauxhall in Luton were told the plant would shut, ending 120 years of the carmaker’s association with the town and putting between 1,100 and 2,000 jobs at risk. One&nbsp;result was two&nbsp;days of protests in the town a week&nbsp;before&nbsp;Christmas.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on the Shipping Forecast at 100: the radio’s prayer | Editorial,"‘Around the Bay of Biscay and back for tea’. The weather bulletin has inspired poets and popstars and become our national lullabyIt is no surprise that the Shipping Forecast, which turned 100 on New Year’s Day, is one of the cultural touchstones of our times. The weather is our national obsession, after all. Alan Bennett and John Prescott have read it, while poets Seamus Heaney, Sylvia Plath and Carol Ann Duffy have been inspired by it, along with musicians Tears for Fears, Radiohead and Blur. To mark its centenary, BBC Radio 4 devoted a day to celebrate this twice-daily bulletin and its place in the British psyche.In her diary, in January 1925, Virginia Woolf reported that it was “all gale &amp; flood; these words are exact” over New Year in East Sussex. And so it was a century later. Listening to the familiar refrains – Dogger, Fisher, German Bight – while wind and rain lashed outside, was a warm bath for the soul. Gavin and Stacey’s Ruth Jones read that day’s report as Nessa. But with parts of the country experiencing terrible flooding, it was a reminder of the dangers that led to its creation. This mixture of consolation and distant drama goes to the heart of what has come to be known as “the nation’s&nbsp;lullaby”.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That flat will always mean home, 24 December). Only my mother was brave enough to light it, as it made explosive noises when exposed to flame. That was in the bathroom, the only room in the flat without a coal fire. Our flat was on the top floor of a corner house in Kingly Street, behind Liberty in Regent Street, London, and once had clearly been the servants’ quarters of a great house.It had high windows and many rooms, and the kitchen had a huge built-in dresser, an enormous sink and a dumb waiter. In front of the kitchen range was a large sofa, and there was a big table at which my mother and aunt sat and sewed jackets for Savile Row firms, and I later did my homework.

The Guardian,Working on a world free of nuclear arms | Letters,"Readers Aaron Tovish, Diana Francis and Caroline Westgate respond to our editorial about arms control to prevent nuclear warThank you for addressing this existential threat to our world (The Guardian view on arms control: essential to prevent the total devastation of nuclear war, 27 December). It would seem a no-brainer that the logical corollary to “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought” would be to unconditionally renounce all options to initiate nuclear warfare. To date, only two nuclear-armed states have taken this stance: China and India. It seems to have served them well – at least as well as those that retain the option of escalating a conventional war into a nuclear war.In an armed conflict between nuclear powers, it is courting disaster to make your adversary worry about being “beaten to the nuclear punch”, but Nato continues to consider the threat of escalating to nuclear warfare essential to the cohesion of the alliance.

It took me a while to connect the dots. Maybe I was just prone to shin splints? Perhaps your calves were supposed to burn with every stride?

The Guardian,"Nikki Amuka-Bird: ‘I just played the prime minister and thought, me? Run the country?’","The actor, 48, talks about missing her charismatic mum, improvising throughout her life, being a pacifist despite everything and learning to use a gunI became an orphan in my 40s, which was a strange and disturbing experience. This year is the eighth anniversary of my mum’s passing, which feels like an interesting time to think: how much have I learned since she died? Growing up, she gave me these great life lessons, which I’ve been applying since she’s not been here. I feel really proud of her, and proud of myself how I’ve handled it.Mum was an incredible woman. She came from a very humble background. It wasn’t until she was dying that I read her secret journals about how tough, neglectful and abusive her childhood had been. But she had this spirit of “I’m going to disregard my limitations and do absolutely everything I can to achieve everything I want to achieve.” She wanted me to be stimulated by culture and beauty and the arts.All my friends wanted to stay at our house because they could have conversations with my mum that they couldn’t have with their own. My mum really invited this idea of free thinking. She was the editor of a Nigerian fashion magazine, so it was quite normal to go into the living room and find an impromptu photoshoot. I remember travelling with her to fashion suit shoots in Brazil, thinking she was the most glamorous thing ever.I feel very lucky to be doing the job I’m doing. Often I’m asked to play characters who feel bigger or stronger than I am; women who might intimidate me in real life. I just played the prime minister in the film Rumours and thought: “Me? Run the country?”I’m a hippy at heart. I can apply myself but the machinations of power terrify me. I’m a pacifist. I’m a glass-half-full person. I believe in humanity at its core, and the importance of putting out positivity in the world. It gets harder, when you read the news and see the state of the world. But I return to these practices about loving your neighbour and doing the best that you can.I used to sell candles in a shop called Angelic on London’s Oxford Street, the year before I went to drama college. Since then, I’ve never done any other type of work than acting. You get to this stage in life and think: “Gosh. Surely I should have some other skills?”One thing I have learned is how to use weapons. What’s terrifying is that you feel this extension from your body. I remember between takes constantly thinking: “Where’s my gun?” It terrifies me how quickly the power of having a gun can corrupt you.I cry when I’m happy as well as when I’m sad. When I feel like I’m really connecting to a particular person in a particularly moment, I think: “God, it’s so great to be alive.”Tragedy and comedy are closely linked. It’s playing the truth, understanding the absurdity that as human beings we should have the answers. Most people would have no idea what to do in a crucial moment and are improvising their whole lives out of their depth. There’s something comforting when you remember that.Rumours is in cinemas now; Here opens on 17 January Continue reading...","Sat, 04 Jan 2025 14:00:51 GMT",0.4137,0.994

Apparently inspired by The Iliad, and yours for £35, it is inspired by “a desire for cleaner armpits, and an intention to quell olfactory overload”. If all that sounds highfalutin, this “cultured personal care offer” speaks for itself with a delicious scent and an ability to rival pong.

The Guardian,Questions to ask yourself … to fix your love life,"Dr Orna Guralnik, clinical psychologist and Couples Therapy star, on the prompts that could help your relationshipThis is about asking people to move out of the automatic ways they think about their relationships. In the background, they’ve probably heard many times from their partner what they need, and have found all sorts of ways to ignore that information because it’s hard for them. One person might be asking for more warmth – to hug once in a while, say – and for all sorts of reasons the other person might be withholding that, or they’re not wired that way. But it’s not such a hard give. It can also be something as concrete as, “Remember I don’t eat ham when you’re cooking.” Could you push yourself to be more generous and go beyond your own limits?

The Guardian,The food filter: which supermarket has the best tinned chopped tomatoes?,"Welcome to our new series: a battle of the brands in which our expert cooks taste and rate UK supermarket ingredients. Who wins for quality and flavour, and how much should you spend?Tinned tomatoes are wonderful, essential, enduring things: what would we do without them? Of the various types – whole, crushed, pulped, passata – chopped are particularly accommodating, providing a pleasing tomato presence while being easily reduced to sauce, and good value, too. However, chopped tomatoes (unlike whole tomatoes) can also be an excuse for a lesser product and more preservatives, which is why tasting and comparing is essential.I always taste tomatoes cold, straight from the tin, with my eyes closed – a helper is useful – because, while deep red chunks and sauce are pleasing, they may have no bearing on flavour. I hope for a good balance of sweet, sour (acidity), salty (savoury), bitter and umami; chunks that are firm without being unduly crunchy or unripe; and a sauce that is full-flavoured and has a nice texture, and which might be velvety, but could equally be thinner but juicy. The highest compliment I can pay a tinned tomato is feeling that I could eat the contents cold from the tin. Continue reading...","Sat, 04 Jan 2025 10:00:45 GMT",0.6369,0.9636

The Guardian,Lab-grown meat is the future for pet food – and that’s a huge opportunity for Britain | Lucy McCormick,"While the EU and US hesitate, the UK can become world leader in this burgeoning – and cruelty-free – innovationIf the pet food industry were a country, it would rank as the world’s 60th biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. In countries such as the US, researchers estimate that pet food accounts for about a quarter of total meat consumption. And as the number of pets grows, the environmental impact looks set to increase. But the British government may have unlocked a solution. This year, the UK became the only country in Europe to approve the use of lab-grown meat in pet food.Lab-grown meat may sound futuristic, but the process is actually straightforward. It starts with the harvesting of a small number of animal cells, then the cells are fed essential nutrients to help them replicate and grow, similar to a yeast culture on a petri dish. But unlike a whole living animal, there are fewer limitations on size, there are no welfare concerns, and the setup does not require such vast land, water and energy resources.Lucy McCormick is an analytics manager at the Guardian and a writer on economics, politics and current affairs Continue reading...","Sat, 04 Jan 2025 10:00:46 GMT",0.6249,0.7935
