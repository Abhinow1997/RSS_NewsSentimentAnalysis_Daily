The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskyy vows his country will do everything in 2025 to stop Russia,"‘May 2025 be our year,’ Zelenskyy said in an address to the nation just before the clock struck midnight in Kyiv. What we know on day 1,043Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has vowed that his country would use 2025 to fight for an end to Russia’s nearly three-year-long invasion. The Ukrainian leader’s address caps a difficult year for the war-battered country which has been fending off a better-resourced Russian army for nearly three years. “May 2025 be our year,” Zelenskyy said in an address to the nation just before the clock struck midnight in Kyiv. “We know that peace will not be given to us as a gift but we will do everything to stop Russia and end the war.”Zelenskyy said that no one would give peace to his country as a gift, but he believed the US would stand alongside Kyiv in its fight. He recalled conversations with outgoing US President Joe Biden, president-elect Donald Trump and “everyone who supports us in the United States”. “I have no doubt that the new American president wants and will be able to bring peace and end (Russian President Vladimir) Putin’s aggression,” he said.Russian gas is not scheduled to flow via Ukraine to Europe on 1 January, data from Ukraine’s gas pipeline operator showed Tuesday, as a key transit deal between Moscow and Kyiv nears its end. Ukraine has been allowing Russia to pipe gas to Europe via its territory under a five-year deal signed in 2019, but Zelenskyy has ruled out extending it amid Russia’s invasion. Data from Ukrainian operator OGTSU showed deliveries via the only entry point for Russian gas into Ukraine dropping to zero as of 1 January 2025.Russia advanced by almost 4,000 square kilometres (1,500 miles) in Ukraine in 2024, seven times more than in 2023, an AFP analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War showed on Tuesday. The data highlights the pressure Ukraine faces as it enters 2025, with Moscow pouring resources into its invasion and uncertainty hanging over future US aid for Kyiv under a Donald Trump presidency. Much of the Russian gains came in the autumn, as they took 610 square kilometres in October and 725 square kilometres in November. Those two months saw the Russians capture the most territory since March 2022, in the early weeks of the conflict. Russia’s advance slowed in December, coming to 465 square kilometres in the first 30 days of the month.The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday its forces had hit a Russian oil depot in the western Smolensk region, setting fire to tanks storing oil products. Ukraine’s general staff said on the Telegram app that the depot was used for military purposes. It did not specify the weapon used for the strike but said it was carried out in cooperation with drone forces.
 Smolensk region governor Vasily Anokhin said that the attack caused a fuel spill and fire. He said 10 Ukrainian drones were shot down by Russian air defences but the wreckage of one of them fell on the oil facility. Ukraine has staged numerous attacks on Russian oil storage facilities and refineries. Continue reading...","Wed, 01 Jan 2025 01:44:41 GMT",-0.7269,-0.2966

Summer’s the new winter!’ … Never believe anyone when they say this shit to you.” By October, the cult Channel 4 thriller had been axed. For Kelly, who had a third series mapped out, it was “heartbreaking” to bid farewell before he had planned to. “But I’m quite stoic. I learned a long time ago not to take things personally.”Today, TV cancellations seem to be a weekly occurrence and this year alone has seen the likes of Kaos, Constellation, The Acolyte, My Lady Jane and Dead Boy Detectives bow out after just one season. But shows being cut off mid-sentence is nothing new. What made Utopia brilliant – its full throttle conspiracy paranoia, highly stylised aesthetic, dark comedy and graphic violence – also made it a challenging sell. But Kelly says that Channel 4 were all in … until they weren’t: “I never want to beat up Channel 4, not because I feel loyalty to them because I don’t, but I feel like they really gave it a go and they never pushed back on anything … If I were to criticise them, I’d say you should be able to see through how many people are watching something now to its value beyond that.” Continue reading...","Tue, 31 Dec 2024 16:00:49 GMT",0.6476,-0.5911

The Guardian,The term ‘antisemitism’ has been weaponised and stripped of meaning – and that’s incredibly dangerous  | Rachel Shabi,"Israel uses it to silence critics of its Gaza war while the right uses it to attack opponents. Meanwhile, the issue itself goes unaddressedWhen the international criminal court issued arrest warrants for Israeli officials in November, the response from the country’s government was all too familiar. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, rejected outright the warrants for alleged war crimes in Gaza against him and the former defence minister Yoav Gallant, calling them “an antisemitic decision”. The ultranationalist national security adviser, Itamar Ben-Gvir, declared that the court had shown “once again that it is antisemitic through and through”. And the transport minister, Miri Regev, chimed in, claiming: “This is modern antisemitism in the guise of justice.”Bleakly, none of this was a surprise. Over a year into Israel’s assault on Gaza, which some experts have described as a genocide, accusations of antisemitism raised to counter criticism of Israel have gone into overdrive. Such claims have been made against protesters crying out for an end to the bloodshed in Gaza and against the UN and aid agencies warning of a humanitarian catastrophe. They have been levelled at global news channels and the international court of justice; against actors, artists, pop stars and even British-Jewish film-makers. So sweepingly and speech-chillingly are such claims made by Israel’s diehard defenders that the very term “antisemitism” is losing its meaning. It is exactly as the British-Jewish philosopher Brian Klug warned 20 years ago: “When antisemitism is everywhere, it is nowhere.” Blanket misuse has, troublingly, turned the term into a feature on an Israeli politician’s lingo-bingo scorecard.Rachel Shabi is the author of Off-White: The Truth About AntisemitismDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Those times are over | Fatma Aydemir,"Brutal cuts to culture subsidies are about to make the city a welcoming place only for the lazy work of rich kid artistsIn 2003, Berlin had just woken up from a decade-long fever dream: the Wall had fallen, the city had reunited and the two German states had a common capital once again. Financially, Berlin’s awakening was a total hangover: billions in debt had piled up and unemployment had reached an all-time high. Culturally, however, the city was blooming. The arts and nightlife were bustling like a never-ending after-hours party on the leftovers of the cold war. This parallelism of decay and pleasure was described by the then mayor, Klaus Wowereit, in an interview that year as “poor but sexy”.The phrase was so cheesy and so powerful, it became a slogan for Berlin’s image in subsequent years, drawing young creatives from all over the world to the city’s promising subculture scenes and its relatively affordable housing. One of these young people was me. In 2012, when I had just graduated from university, I planned to stay in Berlin for the summer.

Today, the battle over the government’s contradictory plans for the health serviceThe British government’s 10-year health plan is still some months off. So is the multi-year spending review that will set the parameters around funding. But the three themes around which Labour plans to build its NHS reforms are set. Each involves a change in emphasis: from treatment to prevention, hospital to community and analogue to digital.As health policy is devolved, these plans apply directly only in England. Their impact, though, will be UK-wide, since the largest health system is bound to influence the others, and what happens to the NHS is so crucial to the UK government. In 2025 – Labour’s first full calendar year in office since 2009 – there is arguably no area in which the party is more urgently in need of results.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Economists were worried enough to publicly warn her this month that liberalising financial sector regulations could undermine the government’s efforts to grow the economy, posing “particular risks to the government’s wider industrial strategy”. They also stressed the importance of not forgetting the painful lessons of the 2008 global financial crisis.The experts were responding to the chancellor’s November Mansion House speech, in which Ms Reeves suggested that post-crisis regulations have “gone too far”. This is a troubling statement. Those rules were implemented to curb the sector’s excesses, prevent systemic risks and ensure that the Treasury does not have to bail out its failures. Rolling back such measures&nbsp;in the name of economic growth ignores the&nbsp;stability and protection they’ve provided.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Here’s how we could reform the Lords for the 21st century | Letters,"Venetia Caine and Philip Wood suggest ways to reorganise the upper house, while Michael Meadowcroft points to a report that offered practical solutions back in 2007. Plus a letter from Chris RennardI’m sure that your editorial (25 December) is right that one of the reasons reforming the House of Lords is taking so long under this government is that there is no clear path ahead, after abolition of the hereditary peers. A fundamental principle is to retain the revising role of the upper chamber. To that end, it needs great expertise. It should, of course, be largely elected, but that would not necessarily ensure that expertise. It should also not be too large and should have continuity.So here is what I suggest should happen: each parliamentary constituency should be joined with an adjacent one, and those 300-plus each elect one member. These would constitute three-quarters of the upper house. They would have their places for 15&nbsp;years, with elections of one-third every five years, the initial and second thirds to be decided by lot.

The Guardian,"I enjoy being home-schooled, but a better inspection system is needed | Letters","Twelve-year-old Mustafa Chaudhry responds to warnings about home schooling after the Sara Sharif case The horrendous case of Sara Sharif rightly raised concerns about the regulation of home schooling in the UK (Judge in Sara Sharif case warns of ‘dangers’ of automatic right to home school children, 17 December). As a 12-year-old home-schooled child, I agree with some of the concerns in Tony Mooney’s letter (25 December) on&nbsp;stricter regulation.I am fortunate that my home-schooling education has offered me a huge variety of opportunities and permitted me to explore different educational pursuits, which would never have been available at school. However, I realise that in the absence of a good inspection regime, a wide range of practices may occur under the guise of home&nbsp;schooling.

The Guardian,Which Thomas Tuchel will turn up on his first day as England manager?,"The coach is faced with the difficult task of preserving Gareth Southgate’s legacy of unity while also turning the team into one that can end a 60-year trophy droughtVolker Kersting, Mainz academy director, sighed. Thomas Tuchel, as of Wednesday England’s new manager, had that look in his eyes. “He just said, ‘Volker’ and I knew what was coming,” Kersting said in Rulebreaker, the Tuchel biography by Daniel Meuren and Tobias Schächter. “I’d been dreading it. He really wanted to go up the mountain and dig up that pin.”“The pin” was a grubby, small Mainz badge which during a summer pre-season training trip in Austria for Tuchel’s then Mainz under-19s team had assumed almost sanctified status. Alongside four-hour training sessions – something of a shock for teenagers – Tuchel also displayed the gift for team bonding that he will require for the England job. One day in Austria, Tuchel insisted the whole squad hire mountain bikes and ride to the summit of the Simmering mountain, where they had lunch and admired the beautiful views before the head coach demonstrated his rhetorical powers, using the moment to tell the team that their goal was to win the league, something never achieved previously by Mainz’s youngsters. Tuchel wanted a ceremony to mark the covenant between team and coach so made do with Kersting’s Mainz badge, which was solemnly wrapped in a Snickers wrapper and buried at the mountain top. “When we reach our final, we will return to dig up our treasure!” Tuchel told them.

The Guardian,The Breakdown | How the 2025 British & Irish Lions may line up in Australia,"Andy Farrell has tricky decisions ahead but expect plenty of Ireland forwards and Scotland backs when the series beginsThe Lions are stronger in certain areas than others and much hinges, in every sense, on Ireland’s front row. No one would quibble hugely if an all-Irish triumvirate of Andrew Porter, Dan Sheehan and Tadhg Furlong pack down for the first Test against the Wallabies in Brisbane on 19 July – but what if all three are not fully firing? The talented, athletic Sheehan is just back from a long-term layoff and injury forced Porter to withdraw from the last Lions tour to South Africa before the squad’s departure. The admirable Furlong, meanwhile, has already been hammering away on Test rugby’s frontline for a decade. It underlines the importance of strength in depth, with the Australia scrum much improved. Both Scotland props, Pierre Schoeman and Zander Fagerson, will fancy making the plane, as will the Wales hooker Dewi Lake (current injury permitting) and, depending on England’s Six Nations form, either Jamie George or Theo Dan. Ellis Genge and Nicky Smith are probably contesting the last loosehead vacancy, with Ireland’s Finlay Bealham, born in Australia, as the&nbsp;third tighthead.

Timothy West was perilously close to being a national treasure. Though in no way grand, he was the man you went to for Important People, mostly real and always played without comment. And he was also our dad.As the son and grandson of actors, he remained a fan of performers doing other things.

What the audience knows, and most of Harry’s fellow players don’t, is that he is a Traitor, working against them – and only turning down the £7,000 because he feels confident in walking away with the entire £100,000.

I tried to keep this in mind when, during a blissful day of beachside rest at the end of 2024, my smartphone was taken by the sea. No big deal, I decided, I can sort it out after the break.

Happily, those two worlds collide in her brie and cranberry bites, AKA an easy, scalable canape that minimises time in the kitchen. Cut a sheet of puff pastry into squares, then push them into the greased holes of a muffin tin. “Dollop each one with leftover cranberry sauce and top with leftover brie. Brush with beaten egg, then bake at 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 for about 20 minutes, until golden.”Lettuce is another great carrier of leftovers, and especially Conor Gadd’s turkey and ham fried rice. The chef/co-owner of Trullo in London starts by separating the leaves of a little gem. “Fry thinly chopped brussels sprouts, get some leftover turkey and ham in there, some [cooked and cooled] rice, sesame oil, fish sauce and a load of chopped spring onions and chilli.” Scoop the mix into the lettuce cups, and you’re done: “It’s a nice contrast from the traditional Christmas flavours,” Gadd says, though, to keep your snack game strong, he suggests perhaps finishing off with a scattering of chopped cashews.Got a culinary dilemma?

There were high hopes for renewed commitment to fair governance, transparency and equal representation. In particular there were hopes for women’s political participation, for more women to be elected to office to shape policies that address the needs of all citizens.For more than a decade, we at the human rights organisation Make Every Woman Count (MEWC) have been tracking women’s political participation across Africa. Unfortunately, we did not see the progress we hoped for this year. In 2014, there were three women serving as heads of state across Africa.

Kay has been researching a reactionary turn among young women, and how a backlash against mainstream feminism has created new spaces online.

The Guardian,"The big picture: Colleen Kenyon’s new year portrait of her twin sister, 1977","The late feminist artists explored ideas of doubling and twinship, as well as helping to redefine notions of craft skillsThe photographer Colleen Kenyon made this new year portrait of her identical twin sister Kathleen in 1977. At the time the two of them were embarking on a shared artistic journey that put them at the forefront of feminist artists interested in reclaiming and redefining “craft” skills, using photomontage and hand-colouring techniques to celebrate and ironise traditionally “domestic” artistic expression, such as scrapbooking. Over the subsequent 25 years the twins, born in 1951, pursued this practice at the Center for Photography at Woodstock in upstate New York, where Colleen became executive director in 1981 and her sister joined her as associate director. Together they developed the exhibition space and a programme of workshops to make the institution a prime mover in the advancement of women in the arts, and for artists of colour.Their own distinctive photographic ideas developed both individually and in tandem in those years. Colleen focused on intricate print-making techniques and delicate hand-colouring of female portraits, while Kathleen pursued her interest in collage, often manipulating mass-produced images of women to give them a pointed comic or political edge. Frequently, the sisters explored ideas of doubling and twinship – their academic parents had dressed them identically until they were 10, before they each insisted on making their own fashion choices – and their art examines their shared genetics and discrete characters in multiple ways.

The Guardian,A ceramicist’s personal take on commemorative blue plaques – in pictures,"For more than 25 years, Horace Lindezey has been making art at Venture Arts, a Manchester-based studio working with learning disabled artists. In his ever-growing collection of ceramic blue plaques, created with the assistance of ceramicist Caroline Tattersall, he celebrates people who have meant something to him – family members, friends, TV personalities and musicians – focusing on life’s central milestones: births, marriages and deaths. “I feel happy with making the plaques,” says Lindezey. “I roll the clay on to the mould, paint it white, then I put the letters on it. I like showing them in exhibitions, in Blackburn and London. I like to see them out there – they are nice memories of some people that have died.”A limited edition book of The Blue Plaques (£25), signed by the artist, is available at venturearts.org Continue reading...","Sat, 28 Dec 2024 17:00:43 GMT",0.0,0.9545
