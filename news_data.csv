The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: fierce fighting reported in Russia’s Kursk region amid new Ukrainian offensive,"Moscow’s forces coming under heavy pressure, according to Russian military bloggers; blasts heard near Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant. What we know on day 1,047See all our Ukraine war coverageRussia says Ukraine has launched a new attack in the Kursk region of western Russia where Russian troops have been trying to eject Ukrainian forces for the past five months. Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday its forces were beating back the Ukrainian forces but Russian military bloggers reported fierce fighting and some said the Russian side had come under heavy pressure. Ukraine’s general staff said 42 combat clashes took place on Sunday in the Kursk area, with 12 continuing. The head of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office, Andriy Yermak, posted on Telegram that there was “good news” from Kursk, adding: “Russia is getting what it deserves.” Russia’s ministry said Ukraine attacked around 0600 GMT near the village of Berdin with two tanks, a mine-clearing vehicle and 12 armoured combat vehicles with paratroops. It said two Ukrainian attacks had been repelled. The battlefield reports could not be independently verified.The Ukrainian army did not comment on the operation, simply saying in its daily report that fighting was under way in the Kursk region without elaborating. Zelenskyy said on Saturday that in two days of battles near the Kursk village of Makhnovka, “the Russian army lost up to a battalion of North Korean infantry soldiers and Russian paratroops”. Ukraine launched a cross-border raid into the Kursk region last August and Russia’s army has since recaptured only about 40% of lost territory. Ukraine’s new offensive comes as both sides seek to strengthen their negotiating hand ahead of US president-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House on 20 January, with Zelenskyy hinting that land around Kursk could play a part in any peace deal.Zelenskyy said security guarantees for Kyiv to end Russia’s war would only be effective if the US provides them, and that he hoped to meet Trump soon after his inauguration. He said Ukrainians were counting on Trump to force Moscow to end its war and that Russia would escalate in Europe if Washington were to quit the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) military alliance. In an interview with US podcaster Lex Fridman published on Sunday, the Ukrainian president also renewed his call for Ukraine’s Nato membership.The International Atomic Energy Agency reported hearing loud blasts near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant on Sunday, coinciding with reports of a drone attack on the plant’s training centre, the head of the nuclear watchdog said. It had not yet been able to confirm any impact, Rafael Mariano Grossi said, adding that reports said there were no casualties or impact on equipment.One person was killed and another wounded in Russian shelling of the city of Nikopol in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region on Sunday, local officials said. Downstream along the Dnipro River, at least six people were wounded when Russian troops shelled the city of Kherson, the Kherson region’s capital. Moscow sent 103 drones into Ukraine overnight to Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, with Ukraine’s air force saying 61 drones were destroyed and 42 lost, likely due to electronic jamming. Russia’s defence ministry said 61 Ukrainian drones were shot down in western Russia. No casualties were reported but Rostov’s regional governor, Yuri Slyusar, said residential buildings and cars were damaged by falling drone debris.Dozens of sea mammals have been found dead since last month’s Russian oil tanker spill in the Black Sea, a dolphin rescue centre said as authorities raced to contain the disaster. The spill began on 15 December, when two ageing Russian tankers were caught in a storm off the Kerch Strait linking Crimea to southern Russia. One sank and the other ran aground, pouring about 2,400 tonnes of a heavy fuel oil into the surrounding waters, authorities estimate. Russia’s Delfa centre, which rescues and rehabilitates dolphins, said on Sunday it had recorded 61 dead cetaceans – a type of aquatic mammal that includes whales, dolphins and porpoises – since the incident.

The Guardian,Playing Nice review – James Norton’s baby-swap thriller is mind-bendingly bad,"Coiling ridiculous plot around a nauseating premise – babies swapped at birth, one of the parents is a hellish sociopath – makes for a hollow and unpleasant watch. This is the very worst of modern televisionThe brazenly ludicrous TV thriller has its place. Sometimes it’s fun to throw all logic and sense to the wind and surrender to a bananas plot whose twists and turns – which play out amid huge, aspirationally spotless homes and gorgeous vistas – are so entertaining and hilariously camp that you end up glued to the screen. Unfortunately, Playing Nice does not fit this mould. Yes, it’s a frantically tense drama, set in a beautiful location, that teems with preposterous coincidences and plot developments. But it is also a story about forcibly removing preschoolers from their parents and exposing them to potentially mortal danger at the hands of a disturbed sociopath. Which, you know, isn’t really my idea of a laugh.Playing Nice – adapted by Grace Ofori-Attah (Malpractice) from the book by JP Delaney, whose novel The Girl Before was also turned into a disappointing BBC drama – does have a compelling moral conundrum at its core. The Rileys – restaurateur-chef Maddie (Niamh Algar), stay-at-home dad Pete (James Norton, slipping in and out of a strangely high-pitched Cornish accent) and their son Theo – are a picture of down-to-earth familial joy. Until, that is, the hospital phones to inform them that Theo isn’t their biological child: recent genetic testing on another boy suggests two premature babies got mixed up in a neonatal intensive care unit three years ago. Although this is incredibly unlikely in reality (and the show’s eventual explanation for the swap is nowhere near convincing enough), it taps into a primal fear: which new mother semi-delirious with exhaustion on the postnatal ward hasn’t fleetingly feared such a scenario? And the upshot – that two couples each feel a deep-seated connection towards both children – is a complex and fascinating ethical puzzle that a better drama might have dug into. But Playing Nice – if this wasn’t already abundantly clear – is a very bad drama. Continue reading...","Sun, 05 Jan 2025 22:00:29 GMT",0.128,0.9108

The Guardian,Julian Lennon: ‘I’m not part of the Beatles inner circle – I never have been’,"The musician and photographer on escaping the shadow of his father, writing a memoir with a difference, and why his days of wallowing are overBorn in Liverpool, Julian Lennon, 61, was raised almost solely by his mother Cynthia, but has spent his adult years labouring to get out from under the shadow of his famous father, John. Already a Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter, children’s author, documentary film-maker and philanthropist, he’s now moved into fine art photography with a glossy new book, Life’s Fragile Moments. Spanning more than 20 years of work, it includes reportage taken while travelling the world for his charity, the White Feather Foundation; a closeup of his half-brother, Sean Lennon, taken on tour; and candid glimpses of a royal wedding. He lives in Monaco.How did you get interested in photography?I think I was about 11 years old when I first went out to the US to see Dad, and he had a very simple brown leather Polaroid camera that he used a fair amount – I have it here. I was really fascinated. That immediacy was exciting. I tried becoming a photographer with film, but always had problems – although I have great patience on some levels I have little in other circumstances. Then digital came along.

The Guardian,"‘Friends keep me tethered’: actor Joe Alwyn on fame, dating Taylor Swift and keeping his feet on the ground","Joe Alwyn has had an astonishing rise. After his breakthrough with Ang Lee, he wowed in Conversations with Friends and now stars in The Brutalist. Throw in his ex, Taylor Swift, and you have a redhot A-lister ready to goIf – as projected – The Brutalist goes to the 2025 Academy Awards and cleans up, there will be some knowing, told-you-so nods from critics and industry experts. A monumental epic, the film has already earned comparisons to Citizen Kane and the Daniel Day-Lewis masterpiece There Will Be Blood. Over an engrossing three and a half hours, with an intermission, The Brutalist wrestles with the American dream, the vagaries of capitalism, the immigrant experience and antisemitism. Everyone agrees its lead, Adrien Brody, who already has a little gold statue, has never been better. The film is shot entirely on an obscure retro format, VistaVision, that hasn’t been used on an American movie since 1961. Tick, tick, tick, tick: textbook Oscar-bait.Not that Joe Alwyn, 33, the British actor who also stars in The Brutalist sees it that way. “To be honest, I thought it might be a really good film that not many people would end up seeing,” he says, when we hunker down for a morning coffee at a hotel in central London. Alwyn is dressed entirely in dark blue; the only flashes of colour are the laces of his hiking boots. He’s over 6ft, but he slouches a little, so you wouldn’t immediately know. “Who knows, maybe it still will?” he continues. “I hope not. But given the things against it, given that it ticks most boxes of what you’re not meant to make as a film these days: length, content, all of that – anything on top of that is a really nice surprise.” Continue reading...","Sun, 05 Jan 2025 09:00:13 GMT",0.5719,0.9686

The Guardian,Labour’s new year resolution? It needs a better story. Here’s one Starmer could tell | John Harris,"There’s a solid social-democratic narrative this government could use – if only its leaders would actually try Picture this. Keir Starmer is sitting at a kitchen table, staring into the camera, wearing decidedly casual clothes. The mug sitting next to his left hand confirms that the people around him are trying something a bit folksy and faux-intimate. As ever, his usual air of awkwardness shows that he is a newcomer to these rituals; in the midst of constant negative news stories, he also looks weary. “I hope you are having a good start to 2025,” he says. “I wanted to begin the new year by assuring you that for me and my government, the work goes on.”Here we go, you think: the usual cliches. “Five years ago this month, our country fell into one of its most significant run of events in living memory. On 31 January 2020, we finally left the European Union. Then, less than two months later, the threat from Covid-19 meant the start of all those lockdowns, and a long period of fear, worry and bereavement.” This, it seems, might be a bit better than usual. “In time, we all hoped that in recognition of what we had been through, the unfairnesses and inequalities that Covid had so vividly highlighted, would finally be acted on. There was a lot of talk about ‘levelling up’ and ‘building back better’, from politicians who had no intention of making those promises real – and even worse, reckless economic policies that simply made lives even more difficult. And soon enough, war in Europe and a huge cost of living crisis were adding to our predicament.”John Harris is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Sun, 05 Jan 2025 13:00:19 GMT",0.4404,-0.8752

The Labour party, on the other hand, ran an election campaign designed to translate widespread disaffection with the Conservatives into the maximum number of votes by saying very little about what they would do about the pressing problems that would face them in government. It worked, but has left them hamstrung when it comes to the tough choices facing a country that is no longer a global economic powerhouse, and that is confronting the fiscal reality of an ageing population and a declining birthrate.

The Guardian,"Start the rebuilding work, Keir Starmer, and show us you’re different to the last bunch of cowboys | Isabel Hardman","Setting up yet another commission on social care is an extreme example of Labour putting off the promised urgent repairsIs this really going to be the year that the government “gets things done”? Keir Starmer is branding it as a “year of rebuilding”, returning to work with a series of announcements that he claims show the government is serious about fixing the NHS. Tomorrow, he will unveil an elective recovery plan for the health service, which he hopes will be received as a radical overhaul – and a sign that he is on the right track after a difficult start to his premiership.The changes include patients being able refer themselves for tests and scans, as well as consultations on the same day as those tests so that they can get on with treatment or have the reassurance of knowing nothing is wrong. There are also changes to the way surgery is planned, so that hip and knee replacements aren’t routinely cancelled during winter crises.

The Guardian,"Why tell someone ‘I love you’ when you could overfeed, ridicule or ignore them?","The holidays have reminded me of the many languages of love – most of them barely comprehensibleIt took a while, over the holidays, to work out how to stop my exhausted, frail mother-in-law jumping up constantly to fetch more food without ever eating herself, but my husband eventually cracked it. “None of us will eat unless you’re sitting with us,” he told her. We downed cutlery the minute she stood up, refusing to touch anything on the table until, thwarted, she was forced to sit, even occasionally nibbling from her plate. It didn’t last, of course – she was soon back ferreting in the fridge because that’s her love language: muscular feeding, spiced with exhortations against waste and occasional emotional blackmail.The American Baptist pastor Gary Chapman’s book The Five Love Languages, published in 1992, has a slightly hokey, patriarchal quality, but there is a grain of something universally resonant there: we give, receive and expect love in ways others might not understand (or indeed want). Chapman is confident his five “languages” – words of affirmation, quality time, gifts, acts of service and physical touch – cover the bases. “I think most of the ways of expressing love fit into one of these,” he told the New York Times in 2022. Most, maybe, but he certainly couldn’t capture all our intimate vernaculars.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Sun, 05 Jan 2025 14:00:19 GMT",-0.0772,0.9837

This proves that he came for all humankind, as well as reducing his parents’ options for witty off-the-peg verbal critiques of him should he leave their front door open. Bearing Christ’s universality in mind, on Christmas Day at lunchtime I made my guests stand to listen to a few hours of festive recordings I had sourced via a bent Prison Service contact. A choir of people convicted of offences relating to the summer riots performed a selection of seasonal songs as my guests listened, hands on their hearts. The man who took a brick in the testicles in Southport added a particularly effective descant on the closing verse of Feed the World. Auntie Gladys was in tears and the old man from next door soiled himself in woe.In the run-up to Christmas, I pondered all those less fortunate than me who would perhaps have to spend the season in prison; or worse still, those who will have to make polite conversation over the turkey with elderly Reform-voting relatives who still think Brexit was a great idea but it just wasn’t done right, and that Nigel Farage is “a character”.Stewart Lee tours Stewart Lee vs the Man-Wulf this year, with a Royal Festival Hall run in JulyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on social care: there can be no more excuses for inaction | Editorial,"Dame Louise Casey must not allow the review she is leading to become another means of deferring change The lack of action, or even a clear direction, on social care reform in England was a disappointment of Labour’s first six months in office. With the recruitment of Dame Louise Casey to lead a review, the government has now made up its mind on how to approach one of the stickiest policy questions. But the proposed timeline is far too extended. By ordering further investigation of the issues, rather than setting out proposals, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, and his colleagues have opted to preside over dysfunction for several more years.The upshot is that the problems it causes will continue to mount up, both for the unlucky people who need the most expensive forms of care and for overstretched parts of the health service. Mr Streeting says that changes will begin to be set in train next year, when Dame Louise delivers interim findings. Failure to follow through on this commitment would be a shocking dereliction of duty by a government that was elected on the back of promises to strengthen public services, particularly in light of the impact on hospitals of social&nbsp;care shortages.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on film and feminism in China: women feel Her Story is their story | Editorial,"The hit comedy has struck a chord by celebrating female friendship and pushing back against misogynyJust over a year ago, Xi Jinping told China’s national women’s congress that the Communist party must “actively foster a new type of marriage and childbearing culture”. For the last two years, there has been not one woman on the 24-strong politburo (no women have ever reached its standing committee, China’s most senior political body). Activism on women’s issues, as in other areas, has been pushed underground.Yet while the political environment is dismal, the unexpected success of a low-budget comedy speaks volumes about the way that feminism has gone mainstream in China. This winter’s surprise hit has been Her Story, the tale of a do-it-all single mother’s unexpected friendship with an artsy, sentimental neighbour, which topped the Chinese box office.

The Guardian,How the ‘continuing healthcare’ system is failing sick and elderly people | Letters,"Readers on the struggles of getting support for loved ones who need care outside hospitalI empathise with Dr Michael Duxbury (Letters, 29 December), but no amount of empathy will increase the chances of his mother, or anyone else’s loved ones, becoming eligible for continuing healthcare (CHC). Excuse the flippant tone, but having worked in the health and social care sector for more than a decade, I had always hoped that a proper integration of health (NHS responsibility) and social care (local authority responsibility) would eradicate this ridiculous framework.CHC is a funding stream administered by local integrated care systems (ICSs), whereby people who have a primary need for healthcare (not social care) will have their entire package of care paid for by the NHS. Unlike social care, there is no assessed charge to the person for this care. CHC eligibility is subject to assessment and decision-makers consider four key components of the&nbsp;person’s needs: nature, intensity, complexity and unpredictability. In practice, I have found that decision-making is undoubtedly influenced&nbsp;by an overarching need to gatekeep spending. Continue reading...","Sun, 05 Jan 2025 17:17:21 GMT",-0.765,0.9884

There’s meatless meat, dairy-free cheese, plant-based liqueurs and, well, anything else you can think of.With more than a decade of veganism under my belt, I’ve tried pretty much every plant-based brand going. I was a full-blown omnivore until the age of 20 though, so I can tell straight away when a new vegan product hasn’t got it right. Below, I cover the must-buy alternatives, from cheese to meat, to the foods that would-be vegans fear they’d miss the most. I’ll also tell you what not to buy.

The Guardian,"‘The more relaxed you are, the better you are as a human’: Nicole Kidman on Kubrick, sharks and risk-taking","The Oscar-winning American-Australian actor answers questions from Observer readers and famous fans including Reese Witherspoon, Hugh Jackman and Naomi WattsNicole Kidman has finally found a way to impress that trickiest of demographics: her 16-year-old daughter. “The other night, I was interviewed by Amelia, the chicken nuggets,” she says, with a smirk. The 57-year-old Australian megastar is talking about Amelia Dimoldenberg, the comedian and host of the video series Chicken Shop Date, who buttonholed her for a quick chat on the red carpet at an awards bash in London. “That’s all my daughter cared about, and I loved that,” Kidman goes on. “That to her was like, ‘Oh my God!’ She wasn’t interested in anybody else. And then I saw the things that she did, Amelia, and she’s really funny. I loved her with Billie Eilish, and Andrew Garfield and her was so funny. And now I have to go for a date with her. I’m asking for the date.”Kidman may have a reputation on screen for playing steely and impenetrable, but away from it, she has a more playful, even sillier, side. That charm is front and centre when we meet in a London hotel for the Observer’s You Ask the Questions feature, made up of submissions from friends, collaborators and readers. Kidman wears a boxy grey suit from Tod’s with a prim, white shirt buttoned to the neck and glinting black loafers. Her auburn hair is parted in the middle and falls to just below her shoulders. It’s a serious look, but Kidman laughs a lot: it’s almost the punctuation of her paragraphs. And she clearly seems to enjoy herself today, extending our allotted time and saying, as I’m finally being bustled to the exit by the PR: “I wish we could have had more readers’ questions. Throw one more at me. Come on, one more!” Continue reading...","Sun, 05 Jan 2025 07:00:13 GMT",0.7501,0.9935

For one historian, that’s erasure","In a new book, Dana Frank tells stories of the people who ‘made history happen’ through organizing and mutual aidHistorian Dana Frank treasures a photo from a 1937 edition of Life magazine. It shows a group of seven African American women, clustered close, sitting on chairs in a small space. Each wears a fashionable hat and is bundled in a coat appropriate for the late Chicago winter. At first glance, the photo appears to be a gathering of friends. All are smiling, and some appear to be laughing, as they talk with each other.The women were actually on strike, occupying the city hall office of the president of the Chicago board of health. As wet nurses for a local hospital, they were paid $0.04 for each ounce of breast milk they produced. The women all knew that the white wet nurses at another hospital were getting paid $0.10 per ounce. “They shouldn’t make any difference between us,” Louise Clark, a wet nurse on strike, told reporters at the time.

The Guardian,"Nickel Boys review – sublime, immersive adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s haunting reform school novel","Shot largely from the point of view of its two main characters, RaMell Ross’s masterly film takes you to the wrenching heart of this American south tale of brutal 60s racismAn unwritten rule of cinema is that great books very rarely make great movies. It’s not inevitable that a film adaptation of a literary classic will turn out to be a stinker, but plenty do: take Roland Joffe’s disposable and tawdry version of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter, Brian De Palma’s notorious butchering of Tom Wolfe’s Bonfire of the Vanities, and my personal nadir, Peter Jackson’s mangling of Alice Sebold’s The Lovely Bones. There are ways of side-stepping the curse of the literary adaptation, of course, a recent example being Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest, a picture that kept the title and the location of Martin Amis’s novel but stripped away most of the flesh of the story to make way for Glazer’s chilling vision.RaMell Ross’s astonishing Nickel Boys is something else altogether. Ross’s fiction feature debut (he previously directed the Oscar-nominated documentary Hale County This Morning, This Evening) is adapted by the director and co-writer/producer Joslyn Barnes from the Pulitzer-prize-winning 2019 novel by Colson Whitehead, and it’s an extraordinary achievement. A version that is true to the book, honouring both its spirit and its structure, while also managing to be a genuinely groundbreaking cinematic work. This is a sublime piece of film-making.

He’s good-looking, sweet, interesting and has his life in order. I have no doubt about his sincerity and all-round decency.

All the artistic, artisanal, and ever-inventive technological skills that sustained the company’s success over 70 years were as much part of the locality as its mountains and lakes.The other company founder, her husband, Ottavio (Tai) Missoni, was originally from the shores of the Adriatic, but was working in knits, and on marriage migrated to her territory. Theirs was a union of complementary talents – Tai was an artist of great colour gifts who choreographed how yarns should be fed into which machine to knit what pattern, while she shaped the firm’s overall fashion direction and uses of the output.

All dishes £7-£14, desserts £7, cocktails about £10, wines from £28Let’s start the year with one of life’s great philosophical questions: is there such a thing as bad fried chicken? You, the non-meat-eater at the back, put your hand down. We know your answer. This one is for the rest of you. Obviously, there can be better fried chicken and great fried chicken but, rancid oil aside, can it ever be so dreadful that you are not willing to entertain the idea of eating it? We’ve all heard the saying that “There is no such thing as bad pizza.” While I’m more than capable of worrying over the chewiness or otherwise of a blistered crust, or kvetching about sauce and topping ratios, I get the point. Speaking on behalf of my inner 13-year-old, it seems obvious that a day with pizza in it is probably better than one without, however lacklustre the pizza might be. Ditto fried chicken. The appeal is just so obvious: a shattering, highly seasoned crumb, which coats folds of crispy skin, giving way to the meat within. On the bone or off, it is one of life’s great, visceral pleasures.

The Guardian,How Israeli forces destroyed Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp – video analysis,"Using video analysis and satellite imagery, the Guardian has chronicled the destruction of the Jabaliya refugee camp through three offensives since October 2023.

The Guardian,The big picture: every chocoholic’s dream?,"Irene Poon’s alarming 1965 image of a sweet shop in San Francisco’s Chinatown exemplifies her knack for intimacy and surprise The American photographer Irene Poon grew up in San Francisco’s Chinatown, where her father owned a store selling traditional herbal medicine. Graduating from art college in 1967, her work concentrated on the people and the community she lived among, glimpsing little moments of intimacy and surprise, telling their stories from the inside. Poon took this picture of her sister Virginia in 1965 in a sweet shop in the district. The composition seems drawn directly from feverish childhood imaginations – certainly, chocolate bars have rarely been cast in a more alarming light.Poon, now 83, worked as a curator and art historian at the San Francisco State University art department for 45 years, helping to build its collection of 300,000 images stored on slides, and creating multiple exhibitions including landmark shows about the settlement of the American west and the role played by Asian communities in the gold rush and beyond. In 2001 she published an important guide to 25 formative Asian American artists who had inspired her photography, recognising several in print for the first time. Alongside her day job, Poon pursued her own work, continuing to document and reimagine the changing faces of Chinatown over the decades; those portraits, as here, often emerging from dramatically shadowed interiors.American Photography is at the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, 7 February-9 June; an accompanying book is published by Nai010 (€45) on 3 February Continue reading...","Sun, 05 Jan 2025 07:00:14 GMT",0.25,0.9607

The Guardian,On the buses: glimpses of passing commuters in rainy London – in pictures,"In October 2005, BBC presenter Steve Madden was standing in Shaftesbury Avenue when he saw a woman on the 38 bus, her figure framed by the misted-up window, which reflected the lights from the street. He took a snapshot and, years later, struck by a similar scene, he had the idea for a photography series. Between January 2017 and March 2020, he waited for cold, rainy evenings, then stationed himself in various locations around London to photograph commuters visible through the bus windows. “I was searching for the beauty in the half-obscured passengers,” he says. “It’s a mix of fleeting glimpses into people’s lives and the strange, unpredictable shapes they make behind the condensation.”The Grind by Steve Madden will be published by GOST Books in February Continue reading...","Sat, 04 Jan 2025 17:00:54 GMT",-0.0772,0.1779
