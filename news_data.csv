The Guardian,Bank of Dave 2: The Loan Ranger review – Rory Kinnear files a solid return as the bloke from Burnley,"The businessman with a heart takes on crooked payday lenders in this predictable sequel that gets by on its heartfelt performancesIt won no prizes for subtlety, but cheerful, victory-of-the-underdog comedy Bank of Dave featured a stonking lead performance by Rory Kinnear as Dave Fishwick. He’s the Burnley businessman who made millions selling vans then took a stand against fatcat bankers by opening his own community bank, the Bank of Dave, in 2011. Now Kinnear is back for a sequel, this time taking on crooked payday lenders. Like the first film, Bank of Dave 2 is predictable and cliché-ridden but gets by on likable, heartfelt performances, and the knowledge that in real life some of this stuff actually happened.The film picks up two years after the original. The “Bank of Dave” on the high street in Burnley is still going strong – lending to ordinary people who struggle to secure loans from bigger banks. Dave is outraged to discover the sharp practices of payday lenders targeting the vulnerable (in one case squeezing £3,000 out of a £600 loan). Rob Delaney does his best in a small role as the film’s one-note villain Carlo Mancini, the New Jersey owner of fictional payday lender Quick Dough, who has links to organised crime.

Cue rightwing politicians indulging in competitive brown-nosing as they pretended they had always been interested in grooming gangs while the government tried to point out there had already been an inquiry and it was probably better to implement its recommendations rather than waste time and money with another one.This may have been an unwanted problem for Keir Starmer and the home secretary, who took the brunt of the unedifying shitshow, but for every other minister it came as something of a relief.

The Guardian,"‘We will glorify war – and scorn for women’: Marinetti, the futurist Mussolini sidekick who outdid Elon Musk","He was the brilliant yet alarming writer of the Futurist Manifesto, a bohemian poet jailed with Mussolini who helped forge the modern world. As a new show re-examines his troubling legacy, we explore the Italian troublemaker’s extraordinary lifeFilippo Tommaso Marinetti was the Elon Musk of the early 20th century, combining a joy in technological innovation with an appetite for illiberal politics. Where Musk builds rockets, Marinetti celebrated those shiny new inventions, the aeroplane and the motor car. The Futurist Manifesto, which he wrote when the movement existed only in his head, begins with a rhapsodic account of a fast drive that ends in a crash, which delights him more than the Winged Victory of Samothrace, the famous Greek sculpture in the Louvre. Machines, he believes, make all previous art irrelevant. Futurism will hymn the hard new beauty.Marinetti’s role in the making of the modern world is insufficiently recognised, presumably because he was so contentious and offensive to mainstream democratic values. Futurism is celebrated for the artists and architects it inspired, rather than its manifesto-issuing, speech-making, rabble-rousing leader. But an exhibition opening this month at London’s Estorick Collection draws attention to Marinetti’s own creative contribution to futurism. Entitled Breaking Lines, it centres on what Marinetti called “words in freedom”, the formless, collage-like experimental poetry he invented in his 1912-13 sound and concrete poem Zang Tumb Tuuum.

The Guardian,The chronicle of a fire foretold | Rebecca Solnit,"The current fires in Los Angeles are reminders of the costs of forgettingThe fires raging in and around Malibu are huge, and they’re terrible, and they’re also the latest in a series of catastrophic fires in Los Angeles county and the region, the latest consequence of heat and drought and wind that have long created the region’s volatile fire weather.The climate crisis has made it hotter and drier and made wildfire worse here and across the west and around the world, but this region’s ecology has always been wedded to fire. Homes built in and around natural landscapes – canyons, chaparral coastal hills, forests, mountainsides – with a history of wildfire that are pretty much guaranteed to burn again sooner or later create the personal tragedies and losses and the pressure for fire crews to try to contain the blazes. But suppressing the blazes lets the fuel load build up, meaning that fire will be worse when it comes.Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

Last year will go down as the first time that the global average temperature exceeded 1.5C above preindustrial times over a calendar year. We could crash permanently through the 1.5C guardrail within the next five years, and shatter the 2C limit as soon as 2034.

The Guardian,This 77-year-old climate activist should never have been jailed – and now faces a Kafkaesque struggle to get out | Zoe Williams,"A failure of justice, and draconian Tory law, put Gaie Delap in prison. A failure of government is keeping her thereGaie Delap will turn 78 on Friday, in Eastwood Park prison, Gloucestershire. Sentenced to 20 months last August for climbing a gantry over the M25 for Just Stop Oil, she was released in November to serve the rest of her sentence on a home detention curfew. But the electronic tag that she was required to wear couldn’t go round her ankle because she has deep-vein thrombosis and it might have risked causing her a stroke. It couldn’t go round her wrist because they couldn’t find a tag small enough, which people keep saying is because she’s frail. Delap hates being called frail. Her wrist is a perfectly reasonable size, 14-and-a-half centimetres. It’s the wrist-tag design that’s wanting. The topsy-turvy world where a government contractor, Serco, can fail and fail again, while a citizen with a social purpose gets called back to prison five days before Christmas to atone for that failure, isn’t even the most absurd thing about this story.Delap was engaged in direct action to raise awareness about the climate emergency, and the day citizens stop doing that is the day that progressive politics might as well give up and go home. Whatever pretzel twists Labour ministers have to perform to sound as if they’re on the side of the decent, honest commuter, while simultaneously signalling that they understand the scale of the climate crisis, they must surely remember this: the trade union movement, the peace movement, the suffragette movement, the civil rights movement, the climate justice movement; every known movement of change has relied on non-violent action to disrupt the status quo.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"Big retail will cope – but Reeves’ NICs raid is too much, too soon for part-timers | Nils Pratley","In the hospitality sector, where labour costs are a bigger proportion of the overall base, employers have fewer optionsIf one looked solely at this week’s trading reports from the world of big retail – the likes of Marks &amp; Spencer, Next and Tesco – you might wonder why Rachel Reeves’ increase in employers’ national insurance contributions (NICs) has caused such a fuss. It is obvious from the trio’s outlook statements that they will cope with the extra costs.At Tesco, which faces a £250m extra from NICs and other budget changes, the chief executive, Ken Murphy, did not rule out price rises but said the group would do its “very best” to mitigate them; and, given Tesco’s expertise in grinding out efficiency gains, you would bet on it to succeed. In similar style, Stuart Machin at M&amp;S noted the cost headwinds but said “there is much within our control”. Continue reading...","Thu, 09 Jan 2025 18:00:43 GMT",0.0,0.9217
The Guardian,I can’t get this poor old man and his trolley out of my mind  | Adrian Chiles,"He wouldn’t sit down, wouldn’t get off, couldn’t or wouldn’t tell us what he wanted. What could we do? I was part of a miserable incident on a bus. This was one evening just before Christmas and I had somewhere to be. As I got on, the driver was trying and failing to communicate with an old man holding a shopping trolley. “He says he wants to go to Enfield,” said the driver. The poor chap with the trolley looked at me and said nothing. His hands had a tremor about them. “Enfield?” I asked. He just stared at me. If he really had wanted to get to Enfield, far north London, by bus, from where we were in far west London, he was in for a very long night indeed.Wondering if his English wasn’t good, I tried every other language I could muster. He said nothing, but when I tried Croatian on him, there seemed to be some reaction. A Polish woman pitched in but got no further. I had no clue what to do, where to take him or what anyone else could have done for him. We didn’t even know his name, and he was either unwilling or unable to tell us.

New policies to tackle all forms of abuse are needed urgentlyInquiries into institutional failures are a vital element in public life. These have three broad purposes, the first of which is finding out the truth. Closely linked to&nbsp;this is accountability, which means listening to victims as well as apportioning blame. The third is to influence policy and attitudes.In recent days some victims of and campaigners against gang-based child sexual abuse and exploitation&nbsp;have argued that further investigation of&nbsp;this form of crime, and official failures in dealing with it, is needed. The appalling bullying of Jess&nbsp;Phillips by Elon&nbsp;Musk, and Kemi Badenoch’s cynical response, do&nbsp;not invalidate such arguments. While many members of the sex abuse gangs in Rochdale, Rotherham and elsewhere have been jailed, with further prosecutions in train, the impunity with which some operated remains disturbing.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Jimmy Carter’s funeral: requiem for a good man and a better era | Editorial,"Five living presidents gathered at the service in Washington. They were a reminder of how much has changed in US politicsHeavy with honours, attended by all living US presidents, and swathed in public affection, Jimmy&nbsp;Carter received a solemn state funeral on Thursday&nbsp;on the kind of cold and crystalline January&nbsp;day at&nbsp;which Washington DC’s climate can excel. Within hours, though, the 39th US president’s remains were interred&nbsp;in a private ceremony alongside his wife Rosalynn, in the shadow of the modest house they built in 1961 in Plains, Georgia, where Mr Carter was born more than a century ago, and where he died at the&nbsp;end of December.This sharp juxtapositions of Mr Carter’s final day in the world’s eye were somehow appropriate. He made his home in Washington for the four years of his presidency, but his roots and heart were always in Georgia. His manifest personal decency and lack of Beltway experience made him the “not-Nixon” that the US needed after Watergate. Yet after a presidency marked by spiralling oil prices and the Iran hostage debacle, America quickly turned to a “not-Carter” candidate in the shape of Ronald Reagan.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,British politics are not Elon Musk’s to toy with | Letters,"Miguel Martinez Lucio, Dominic Crossley and Matthew Campbell respond to an article about the owner of X turning on Nigel FarageYour article (Elon Musk turns on Nigel Farage and calls for new leader of Reform, 5 January) raises fascinating insights as to how international interests play an ever more direct role in the British political system. Discretion is not assured. What is becoming clear is that the likes of Nigel Farage seem to have dispensed with the illusion that Brexit was about political independence. Instead, the need to comply with far-right US agendas, the infantile inconsistencies of rogue James-Bond-type billionaires, and to accept millions of pounds in overseas income are openly accepted.The positioning of Reform UK’s development in relation to overseas interests is at odds with the earlier rhetoric of national sovereignty. If ever there were a moment of amnesia in British politics, it is now. Given this focusing on the idiosyncratic turns of overseas business people, perhaps the government can seize the moment and complete an aspect of Brexit’s failed project that did have one moral feature: ensuring that it was the British people who should finance British politics.

The connection has always been embraced and never more so than in the buildup to their third round visit to Liverpool, the Premier League leaders. As the Accrington captain Seamus Conneely said: “We’ve made it to third and fourth rounds before, we’ve had League Cup runs and played in some great stadiums, but we’ve finally got that big one. Liverpool is going to top it all.” Accrington have sold their entire 4,700-ticket allocation and the tie is of huge significance to the striker Josh Woods, a boyhood Liverpool fan whose reaction to the draw went viral and prompted a reply from Ibrahima Konaté.

In the coffin-sized pit he dragged himself out of, Frayne left behind the weight of expectation that came with his alter ego, having spent two decades creating impossible, death-defying performances as Dynamo: floating above the Shard; walking across the Thames; levitating below Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro. Now working under his own name, Frayne’s latest project takes him out of the spotlight. “I’ve learned over the past few years to move from focusing on the magic in me,” he says, “to being a conduit to helping other people see magic in themselves.”Bradford-born Frayne is working with acclaimed director Kirsty Housley on Rise, an enormous outdoor spectacle for the opening act of Bradford’s year as city of culture.

Now, the self-reflective singer’s debut album is a marvel of candid songwriting​ – too candid for some, she saysLike many people, Victoria Canal failed to score tickets to last year’s Glastonbury festival. But the singer-songwriter’s solution wasn’t quite so relatable: Coldplay were headlining, so she messaged Chris Martin to ask if he could get her in. It was 1am in London, and Canal was drinking with friends when Martin called to make a better offer: how about she join him on stage?The next day, Canal thought she had “hallucinated” the entire conversation. “I have had many dreams like that before,” she says. But no. Come June, there she was: providing vocal and piano accompaniment to Paradise in front of an enraptured 100,000-strong crowd. In the footage, she seems to be in her element, completely unfazed by such a gargantuan gig. In reality, was she nervous? She pauses and gives me a strange look. “Of course!

The Guardian,Lambrini Girls: Who Let the Dogs Out review – stomps straight to the top of British punk’s table,"(City Slang)Championed by Iggy Pop and riot grrrl royalty, the Brighton duo pile on the jagged riffs, scabrous humour and swearing for their politically charged debutFor the most part, Lambrini Girls’ debut album barrels along in roughly the style that’s hoisted the Brighton duo to cult success over the last few years. There are huge, distorted basslines courtesy of Lily Macieira and equally distorted guitar playing from Phoebe Lunny that flits between post-punk angularity and occasional bursts of poppier, Ramones-y chords. The rhythms are frantically paced, and there are lyrics that focus on societal ills, delivered in Lunny’s distinctive vocal style: she sings like someone angrily trying to make their point in a particularly noisy bar, as a bouncer struggles to usher them out of the door.Combined, this music has drawn appreciative nods from a range of forebears including Iggy Pop, Kathleen Hanna and Sleater Kinney’s Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein. Iggy is so enamoured of the duo that he got them to collaborate on a version of Depeche Mode’s Personal Jesus that appeared alongside tracks by Andrea Corr and Rick Astley on a Trevor Horn-helmed covers album: improbable company in which to find a band whose first EP arrived in a sleeve featuring a pile of shit on fire.

A week in a remote Dutch village tending to the garden of an absent homeowner; birds tweeting in the trees, a picturesque church just over the lane. But there’s something wrong in designer Tom van den Boogaart’s surreal and quietly eerie puzzle game. The tools are all missing, the villagers are weird and you’ve been warned not to go out at night. Plus, the sky is a hallucinogenic haze of red and orange and every once in a while you catch someone watching you from behind a door or through a window. What on earth is going on?Grunn is somehow part gardening sim, part point-and-click adventure and part survival horror thriller. Once you find your shears and trowel you can spend time tidying the hedges and digging up mole hills, but you can also explore the tiny hamlet and its lonely haunted locations, often finding discarded Polaroid snaps which give you photographic clues to where the next tool, implement or puzzle item may be found. There’s a day-night cycle running in the background, and if you do venture out in the dark, odd glitches and ghostly beings are glimpsed at the edges of your vision. As you explore, there are perils to contend with that may well end up killing you – then you start again from scratch with only your memories and photos to guide you.

It is accompanied by a soundtrack that Brian Eno had made from guitar chords, with a delay pattern that parallels the visual loops, echoing the use of loops by the US minimalist composers Philip Glass and Steve Reich.Shown at LFMC screenings and film festivals, it went on to make a mark in popular culture through inspiring the look of, and being occasionally glimpsed in, the music video for Catch the Sun by the indie band Doves.

After Mark Zuckerberg’s announcement of sweeping changes to oversight of content on its platforms, multiple edits have been made to its policies.Among them are:A specific injunction against calling transgender or non-binary people “it” has been deleted. A new section has been added making clear that “we do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation”. It said this was a reflection of “political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality and common non-serious usage of words like ‘weird’”. It also says the policies are designed to allow room for types of speech including people calling “for exclusion or [using] insulting language in the context of discussing political or religious topics, such as when discussing transgender rights, immigration or homosexuality”.Meta’s policies are unchanged in saying that users should not post content targeting a person or group of people on the basis of their protected characteristics or immigration status with dehumanising speech with comparisons to animals, pathogens or sub-human life forms such as cockroaches and locusts. But the changes suggest it may now be possible to compare women to household objects or property and to compare people to faeces, filth, bacteria, viruses, diseases and primitives.It should also be possible now to say transgender people “do not exist”.Meta has deleted warnings against self-admission of racism, homophobia and Islamophobia.
