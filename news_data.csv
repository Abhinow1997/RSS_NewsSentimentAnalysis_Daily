The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Kyiv accuses Moscow of recklessness after oil tanker sinks in storm,"One dead while second tanker in distress in Black Sea near occupied Crimea. What we know on day 1,027Ukrainian officials accused Moscow of recklessness on Sunday after one oil tanker sank and a second vessel ran aground in the Kerch Strait between mainland Russia and occupied Crimea during stormy weather. Dmytro Pletenchuk, Ukraine’s navy spokesperson, said: “These are quite old Russian tankers. You can’t go to sea in such a storm. The Russians violated the operating rules. The result is an accident.”The Volgoneft-212 tanker snapped in half after being hit by a large wave, with a video showing its bow sticking vertically out of the water. One of the 15 crew members was killed in the incident while 11 others were taken to hospital.The tanker was carrying 4,300 tonnes of low-grade heavy fuel oil, known as mazut and footage also showed a black oil slick around the vessel. Commentators said the oil products, if spilled into the Black Sea, would cause serious ecological damage to a marine environment already badly affected by war.Soon after it emerged that a second tanker, the 132-metre Volgoneft 239, was drifting in the same area after sustaining damage. Russia’s emergencies ministry later said it had run aground 80 m from shore near the port of Taman at the south end of the Kerch Strait, which runs between mainland Russia and occupied Crimea.The ministry later wrote on Telegram that efforts to evacuate the 14-member crew had been suspended because of bad weather. The ministry said rescue teams were in contact with the ship, which had all facilities on board necessary to ensure the lives of the crew were not in danger.President Vladimir Putin ordered the government to set up a working group to deal with the rescue operation and mitigate the impact of the fuel spill, news agencies cited Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying, after Putin met with the ministers for emergencies and environment.Ukraine’s SBU security service said on Sunday it had destroyed 40 rail cars carrying fuel to Russian troops in an area of the Zaporizhzhia region Moscow holds in southern Ukraine. The SBU said one of its units had organised a sabotage operation that damaged a rail line as the train was moving near the village of Oleksiivka in a Russian-held part of Zaporizhzhia region. The train was halted, with tanker cars ablaze, and army units fired US-supplied Himars missiles at the site, it said. The account could not be independently verified and Russia made no immediate comment.Russia on Sunday said its forces had captured villages in two key frontline areas of eastern Ukraine as they advance toward the supply hub of Pokrovsk and the industrial town of Kurakhove. The defence ministry said in a daily briefing that troops had “liberated” the village of Vesely Gai south of Kurakhove and the village of Pushkine south of Pokrovsk, both in the Donetsk region.A Ukrainian drone struck a campus belonging to Russia’s National Guard on Sunday in the Russian region of Chechnya, as Kyiv continues to strike back after a mass air attack from Moscow. Footage on social media showed a drone swooping low over the Chechen capital, Grozny, 800 kilometres (500 miles) southeast of the frontline in Ukraine, before exploding. No casualties were reported. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov confirmed the drone hit a site belonging to the Akhmat Grozny riot police battalion, and said that two other drones had been shot down by air defences.

This extraordinary first of two nights at this venue, as McCartney’s Got Back tour reaches the UK, delivers so much.It opens with A Hard Day’s Night and ends two and three quarter hours, 36 songs later with a sublime three-song suite from Abbey Road. The newest song (in a way, at least) is 2023’s “final Beatles single” Now and Then, completed from John Lennon’s old demo and performed in this country for the first time. The oldest is pre-Beatles band the Quarrymen’s lovely skiffle era In Spite of All the Danger. McCartney talks about civil rights for Blackbird and emotionally sings with an onscreen Lennon in I’ve Got A Feeling.

Externally untouched since it was finished in 1966, this celebrated Brutalist masterpiece came with a few caveats – namely its single-glazed windows set in iron frames, that don’t open, making it more than a little chilly in winter and a greenhouse when temperatures soar. “You have to really love this building to live in this apartment,” laughs Giorgetti, joking that he needs to wear a hat and scarf in bed during winter and still wakes up with a frozen face.

The Guardian,"Uncertainty is part of being human, so how can we learn to live with it?","A professor of statistics explains that living is about taking risks and not knowing the outcome, and why it’s important to accept and embrace that My father was an enthusiastic traveller, but as he got older he increasingly suffered from what he called “travel fever”, a vivid term for the acute anxiety felt before a journey, essentially due to uncertainty about all the things that could go wrong. Sadly, this eventually stopped him from going on holiday. Then I, too, started to suffer similar apprehension, so I consulted a psychotherapist. She recommended a small piece of cognitive behavioural therapy, which involved acknowledging the mental and physical symptoms of anxiety, but telling myself that these were essentially indistinguishable from feelings of excitement about the prospect of a journey. This reframing of my feelings has been reasonably effective – it’s one way of dealing with uncertainty.It’s not just the uncertainty of travel that we all have to face. None of us knows what is going to happen, or what is currently going on outside our immediate knowledge, or the vast majority of what has happened in the past. Uncertainty has been called the “conscious awareness of ignorance”, and there is a lot we are ignorant about. Continue reading...","Sun, 15 Dec 2024 13:00:44 GMT",-0.34,-0.9348
The Guardian,‘Celebrating the unknown’: Syrian Alawites fear for future under rebel rule,"Minority Islamic sect associated with overthrown Assad regime waits to see how threats of revenge will play outTo prepare khubeiza, the leaves of the kale-like plant must be roughly chopped and sauteed with onions, garlic and a dash of salt. Folklore says that the recipe originated among the Alawite communities who lived in Syria’s mountainous coastline where the fibrous, wild-growing plant can be found in abundance. So poor were the Alawites during Ottoman times, the story goes, that the only food they could find to eat was khubeiza, which sprouts like a stubborn weed every spring.When Hafez al-Assad, a member of the minority Islamic Alawite sect, seized the reins of power in 1971, he promised to lift the neglected community out of its poverty and end its hunger.

The Guardian,Now Notre Dame reverberates with light: it’s impossible not to be moved,"An extraordinary restoration has swept away the lead dust and made the cathedral vivid, but thankfully not kitsch. Our architecture critic takes a look inside“This cathedral is a happy metaphor of what a nation is and what the world should be,” said President Macron. Yet, in an obvious mismatch, the unity and harmony of the restored Notre Dame de Paris, the collective achievement of thousands of craftspeople, builders, firefighters, engineers, architects, clergy, funders and administrators, is as different as could be from the fractious state of politics in France, whose most recent prime minister resigned in the week before the cathedral’s reopening.What is true is that the achievement of the restoration, more or less within the five-year span improbably promised by Macron amid the still-cooling embers of the 2019 fire, is an example of a French ability to get grands projets done, when they put their mind to it, with ruthless efficiency. It’s of a piece with the country’s extensive TGV train network, or the confident way in which past governments scattered crystalline modernity – the Louvre pyramid, the Pompidou Centre, the Eiffel Tower – around the venerable fabric of Paris. Something to do, maybe, with centralised power, the authority of the president, a history with a Sun King and emperors. Continue reading...","Sun, 15 Dec 2024 10:00:41 GMT",0.0,0.9827

The Guardian,What kind of society would willingly traumatise its children in the name of education? | John Harris,"As claims about practices in two flagship London schools are investigated, it’s time to stop and think about what schools are really forAsk the average Westminster politician about schools policy and the response will focus on issues that never seem to go away: funding, teacher shortages, and the drive to somehow uncouple unequal educational outcomes from children’s social and economic backgrounds. At the moment the stereotypical answer is likely to also touch on the crisis in provision for kids with special educational needs. But what tends to go unmentioned is a subject that seems to be suddenly gaining traction in the real world: many schools’ devout belief in zero-tolerance discipline, and whether that credo might be on its way out.Across England, the same story has been building for a long time. It originated in the New Labour years with the expansion of academies, the cult of the “super head” and a seemingly rational drive to push up results and standards. During Michael Gove’s time as the Tory education secretary and beyond, the same ideas fused with drastic changes in the national curriculum and a belief in quietening schools using old-fashioned punishment. And soon enough, the downsides of those approaches began to surface: eye-watering numbers of kids either suspended or excluded by their school, the grim use of isolation booths and claims that the transfer of so many former council-maintained schools to multi-academy trusts (Mats) had led to a deep crisis in accountability.John Harris is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Sun, 15 Dec 2024 15:55:35 GMT",-0.5859,-0.8873

Frustrated, more than festive. Understanding why is crucial to recognising the underlying political contest of the 2020s, and how high the stakes are. We’re told gloom is the result of short-term political developments, what one politician or another has said. It’s nonsense. The causes are what people see in their lives – the reality of the past 15 years, not the rhetoric of a few months.The public has witnessed elite failure on a colossal scale. When people have seen the economy stagnate and public services collapse, it’s no surprise political trust is low and apathy high. Generally the British are a trusting bunch (three-quarters believe you can trust other people compared with the OECD average of two-thirds), but faith in government is in short supply: only one in four trusted it towards the Conservative administration at the end against two-fifths across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

Last month, Stellantis – the maker of Fiat, Vauxhall, Jeep and Peugeot cars –&nbsp;announced the closure of its Vauxhall van factory in Luton, in part blaming the impact of electric vehicles sales targets mandated by Westminster. Ford has announced it intends to cut 4,000 jobs across Europe, including 800 in Britain, citing sluggish growth in EV sales as a contributory factor.For Labour, and for a sector crucial to the green transition, this is a crucial moment. The government has restored a 2030 cutoff point – kicked back to 2035 by Rishi Sunak – after which the sale of pure internal combustion engines will be banned. But car manufacturers are lobbying for a watering down of the terms of the zero‑emissions vehicles mandate (ZEV), which requires manufacturers to sell a rising proportion of EVs between now and then. Meanwhile, on the right, Kemi Badenoch’s Conservatives and Nigel Farage’s Reform UK seek to caricature the country’s net zero obligations as a virtue-signalling threat to prosperity and growth.

A crisis that built up over the past decade, and whose full impact was eased but also disguised by Conservative measures, has escalated to the point where it is impossible to ignore.The number of children with education, health and care plans (EHCPs), which grant statutory entitlements to support, has risen by 180,000 or 71% in six years, and now makes up 5% of all pupils in English schools. As the Institute Fiscal Studies (IFS) set out last week, around half the overall increase in school funding over the past decade has gone towards helping these pupils and around 1 million others who have high needs but not an EHCP. But despite funding increases, waiting times for assessment remain high while children’s needs go unmet, and parents are driven to distraction by their struggles to access suitable provision.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The forgotten faces of Christmas in China | Letter,"Hugo Wong says the question today should be how much value the free movement of products and people has brought to our nationsReading “made in China” on his toys for the first time, my young Chinese nephew asked me innocently whether Santa was Chinese. Oddly, like Santa’s elves, toy assembly workers in China remain remote and faceless to most of us in the west. In Britain, most Asian migrants work backstage, too, kept in kitchens or workshops, taking the first and last train, earning low wages and hidden from our eyes. In many countries this Christmas, instead of being acknowledged for alleviating our cost of living crisis, those foreign workers will be vilified&nbsp;for stealing our jobs and threatened with tariffs whose consequences economists are still not certain about.It is always easier to blame people who remain invisible and voiceless. Although our world has never been so interconnected, and hence our nations so reliant on each other’s labour, Chinese society remains poorly understood. In the west, Chinese people remain enigmatic, the ever-silent and under-represented minority. When scrutinised, it is often with a political lens as well, maybe showing some cognitive bias.

The Guardian,British inaction helped prolong Assad’s rule | Letters,"The Syrian dictator’s downfall is a decade overdue, writes Alasdair Murray, while Carol Hedges deplores far-right responses on social mediaRegarding your editorial (The Guardian view on the fall of Assad: a tumultuous, fragile hope in Syria, 8 December), the downfall of Bashar al-Assad is welcome, but it is more than a decade overdue. The scenes we have witnessed this week could have taken place in 2013, if western leaders had only shown the courage and resolve to take action against Assad after he used chemical weapons on his own people. It is entirely plausible that, if the US and UK had given full military support to the rebels in 2013, the regime might have fallen, and the war ended then rather than continuing for another 11 years.Instead, the following decade saw thousands dead, countless more imprisoned and tortured, the rise and fall of Islamic State, and a refugee crisis that shook Europe. The failure to intervene in Syria in 2013 stands as one of the worst decisions in recent British foreign policy history, every bit as wrong as&nbsp;the decision to go to war in Iraq in 2003. The first tragic mistake led to the second. Continue reading...","Sun, 15 Dec 2024 18:21:13 GMT",-0.25,-0.9941

The Guardian,Amad Diallo’s simple refusal to give up changes course of Manchester derby | Barney Ronay,"Late intervention gave life to a match that had been akin to elite football reimagined by a robot with a hangoverIt was deeply fitting Amad Diallo should decide this Manchester derby, mainly because for long periods he seemed to be the only person on the pitch not playing under heavy sedation.Footballers are often said to have stood out in a game. Diallo stood out here mainly because he actually seemed to like playing football. In the event this expressed itself in four extraordinary minutes during which Diallo played a lone hand in turning 1-0 down into a 2-1 win. Even before that there were long periods during which the slight, speedy, jarringly urgent figure on the right side of Manchester United’s attack appeared to be the only person on the pitch with any kind of hope that life can still go on, like the lone survivor in a George Romero movie, out there haring around a shopping centre dodging zombies.

The Guardian,"Alexandra Palace is a venue that fits, but will darts outgrow it one day? | Jonathan Liew","All 90,000 world championship tickets sold out in 15 minutes, so it seems a matter of time before money talksThey’re always finding stuff here. Every time the trustees of Alexandra Palace undertake some renovation work on the 151-year-old building, they discover artefacts from the venue’s past: a kind of people’s history in detritus. Usually it’s just rusty coins and ticket stubs. But then there was the time they found perfectly preserved vials of early prototype tetanus vaccine embedded in a wall, a relic from when the place was a first world war hospital. Or a bit of Victorian era graffiti from a disgruntled tradesman, reading: “The wages of sin is death, the wages of a carpenter is worse.”What will they find of today, decades hence, in the palace’s dusty niches and beneath its rotting floorboards? What will the archivists of the future make of the crumpled nun’s wimple, the faded receipt for a halloumi pitta pocket (only £12.50 at 2024 prices), the multiple small plastic sachets containing traces of mysterious white powdery residue?

The Guardian,Russo’s goal gives Arsenal win over Liverpool to extend unbeaten run,"As Arsenal’s players lapped up the full-time applause, the sound of Wham!’s Last Christmas was ringing in the air while the travelling supporters gave their hearts to their interim head coach, Renée Slegers. After a ninth win from her 10 games in caretaker charge , it is easy to see how the Dutchwoman has won their affection, and even though her side were certainly not at their best against Liverpool, they still delivered the result they needed, which is perhaps the simplest sign of their revival in power in recent weeks.This was a match the visitors should have won by a greater margin, and one that could have produced a flurry of goals had it not been for the width of the post; Mariona Caldentey’s first-half penalty, a Katie McCabe header inadvertently angled towards her own goal, and a deflected Beth Mead strike all struck the woodwork in an engaging game, which also featured Frida Maanum firing over the bar when it seemed easier for the Norway midfielder to score.

These days the gap between the teams is such a yawning chasm that the French visitors had a bonus point wrapped up after just 35 minutes.To be fair to Exeter, the defending champions are in a sufficiently rich vein of form in this competition that it almost doesn’t matter whom they are playing against.

The Guardian,Nutcracker review – Wonka meets Mary Poppins in English National Ballet’s reboot,"London Coliseum Artistic director Aaron S Watkin oversees a faintly surreal Edwardian setting of dancing chimney sweeps, suffragettes and Liquorice Allsorts in a sweet but not sickly productionEnglish National Ballet’s brand new production of the Nutcracker vastly improves on its previous version. It doesn’t come with a gimmick or drastic reinterpretation, only the sense that artistic director Aaron S Watkin has really thought things through – and hired a cracking designer, Dick Bird, to make the stage zing.
 The setting is Edwardian London, a view of St Paul’s, chimney sweeps and suffragettes (very Mary Poppins), where magician Drosselmeyer owns a sweet emporium (very Willy Wonka) and is the person pulling all the strings. Getting ahead of Nutcracker’s famously unsatisfying narrative, Watkin and co-choreographer Arielle Smith lay breadcrumbs in the prologue for the later scenes, and make a good stab at weaving some coherence through the acts, with young Clara’s wish fulfilment story at the centre, dreaming of her older self and the Nutcracker prince flying off to the Land of Sweets in a carriage pulled by an ice-seahorse, no less.
 The shift from the Christmas party scene (with its quirky dances that must be Smith’s work) into fantasy is nicely handled. Clara appears shrunken, Alice-style, as the world of toys expands to life-size. There’s a witty injection of surrealism, with dancing gingerbread men and a bomb made of Edam cheese. Some inspired projections too – watch out for the shadowy scurrying rats.
 In the second act, instead of the oft-problematic national dances, we’re treated to a parade of global delicacies, including tanghulu (Chinese candied berries), the Egyptian drink sahlab, its costume like frothy folds of milk, and some very cute Liquorice Allsorts. Rentaro Nakaaki is a stand-out as a spinning, leaping Ukrainian poppy seed roll. Elsewhere there are fewer fireworks and some of the pas de deux feel underpowered – but this act is a series of climaxes which is always difficult to pace. There’s a sense of celebration nonetheless.
 Watching the second cast, Ken Saruhashi makes an excellently eccentric Drosselmeyer; Katja Khaniukova a warm, eager Clara with a sweetly ardent Miguel Angel Maidana her prince; Precious Adams dazzles as a spiky Ice Queen at the centre of the Waltz of the Snowflakes; and Sugar Plum Fairy Sangeun Lee moves with careful spun-sugar delicacy. The whole thing feels familiar but fresh, colourful but still classy, sweet but not sickly. A solid success.

The Guardian,Le Gateau Chocolat: Musicals Mayhem review – dazzling charisma and thundering sonic richness,"Soho theatre, London The major showman takes a solo stroll through show tunes, sing alongs and seasonal hits with vocal highlights that leave you gasping for breathSome Christmasses ago, Le Gateau Chocolat and Jonny Woo teamed up for a cabaret double act on musical theatre at this venue. Le Gateau Chocolat reprises that subject matter in a solo jukebox show that does not quite give us the promised mayhem, but does supply plenty of deep booming baritone notes and high sequined drag glitz.It comprises a medley of show tunes, and a few sing alongs, strung together with no narrative beyond the songs. Some are half spoken, others acted with heart or hummed and mumbled, as if he is literally at home on stage, sipping from a mug, sitting stage-side. It feels like a warmup for Christmassy mayhem by the end of the hour: a minor key production by a major showman. Continue reading...","Sun, 15 Dec 2024 16:31:30 GMT",0.4939,0.85
The Guardian,"‘We want to take the sting out of shame’: Kyla Harris and Lee Getty on narratives, nudity and normalising disabled bodies","The creators of We Might Regret This, an unflinching and taboo-busting sitcom about a tetraplegic woman and her friend/carer, challenges the perceptions of disability. But this is just the start of their storyThere’s little in their new BBC sitcom, We Might Regret This, its co-creators Kyla Harris and Lee Getty shy away from. Harris also stars in the show, playing Freya – a charismatic, tetraplegic 30-something artist fresh from a transatlantic move to London. In need of a personal care assistant (PA), she turns to Jo (Elena Saurel), her chaotic, impulsive best friend. It doesn’t exactly go well. While storylines are entirely fictionalised, the terrain explored – between PA and care-receiver, yes, but also between friends: one disabled, one not – speaks directly to their experiences. And they don’t hold back.Take what’s referred to as “The Shit Scene” in their shared shorthand. A particular on-screen sequence the pair believe gets to the heart of their series’s thumping success. “Bodily functions and fluids make us unnecessarily afraid,” says Getty, “and those fears feed directly into our fears of disability in general. Alleviating that fear, we hope, will help alleviate the fear of disability, too.” They make no apologies if what follows, here or on-screen, leaves you squeamish or icky; confronting sensibilities is very much their MO.

The Guardian,"Jude Law: ‘The persona built on stuff written about me is not me, it’s this other guy’","The actor on 90s nostalgia, how exhaustion helped with his latest role, and his guilt at revealing the truth about Christmas classic The HolidayActor Jude Law, 51, grew up in south-east London as the son of teachers. His breakthrough role in The Talented Mr Ripley earned him a Bafta, an Oscar nomination and enduring tabloid attention. Always versatile, he’s been cast in more complex roles as he’s aged, most recently playing Henry VIII in Firebrand. He’s currently starring in Star Wars: Skeleton Crew on Disney+, and next comes The Order, which Law co-produced and stars in as veteran FBI agent Terry Husk. Directed by Justin Kurzel and written by Zach Baylin, it’s an action film with a political message, anchored in the true story of a white supremacist terror group’s downfall. Its leader was inspired by The Turner Diaries, a novel referenced by Trump supporters during the 2021 attack on the Capitol.What appealed to you about The Order?Zach wrote it before the 6 January insurrection happened but by the time we came on board, we were very aware of its relevance. We also knew we had a cat-and-mouse drama that we could lean on, and that meant we could unpack the characters and let this rather disturbing story tell itself.

Will Coldwell reports on a broken systemThe email arrived out of the blue: it was the university code of conduct team.

If he did not attend a hearing to address the claims made by his professor, or respond to the email, he would receive an automatic fail on the module. The problem was, he hadn’t cheated.Albert, who asked to remain anonymous, was distraught. It might not have been his best effort, but he’d worked hard on the essay. He certainly didn’t use AI to write it: “And to be accused of it because of ‘signpost phrases’, such as ‘in addition to’ and ‘in contrast’, felt very demeaning.” The consequences of the accusation rattled around his mind – if he failed this module, he might have to retake the entire year – but having to defend himself cut deep. “It felt like a slap in the face of my hard work for the entire module over one poorly written essay,” he says. “I had studied hard and was generally a straight-A student – one bad essay suddenly meant I used AI?” Continue reading...","Sun, 15 Dec 2024 07:00:38 GMT",-0.9109,-0.946

But the night of 7 April 2018 was different.According to an extensive investigation by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), two yellow cylinders were dropped from a Syrian air force helicopter, crashing through the top floor of one apartment building and landing on a balcony of another, in the eastern Ghouta town of Douma. The noise they made was negligible compared with the explosions of barrel bombs and airstrikes. But the concentrated green-yellow chlorine gas that hissed out of the canisters was no less deadly.

The Guardian,Gotta lotta bottle: doing the rounds with Britain’s last milkmen – photo essay,"Their floats were once a regular sight, quietly whirring down the country’s streets, delivering daily pints. Photographer Maxine Beuret captures the vanishing world of electric milk floats (and their drivers)You often hear them before you see them: the unmistakable clink and tinkle of glass bottles in crates, and the low whine of the electric motor. Milk floats are a uniquely British sight, and an increasingly rare one, which is why the British photographer and cultural historian Maxine Beuret has spent 20 years documenting their use by dairies across England, as part of her project Two Pints Please.Beuret, who calls herself a historian of the commonplace, has documented several quirks of British culture that are at risk of disappearing (or have since gone), including slam-door commuter trains, TfL’s Routemaster buses before they were decommissioned, and traditional shops in the Midlands including a sweet shop, a men’s outfitters and a hardware store. She first photographed an electric milk float while undertaking another project called Familiar Interiors of Leicester – her hometown – in 2005. As well as creating a record of the library, the hospital, the pub and other cherished places, she visited the local dairy, Kirby &amp; West, and “instantly fell in love” with the milk floats, she says. “I&nbsp;loved the compact, functional design, clean lines, and fragile sense of history they carried with them.”Overlooking the yard at Parker Dairies Continue reading...","Sat, 14 Dec 2024 08:00:10 GMT",0.0,0.765
