Good, good), make sure you leave your phone behind. And don’t use it to research your options beforehand. Or talk about them on it. Or even in front of it. Just buy paper, a pen and a pigeon.

The short version is: we’re done for as private and therefore free citizens.

Unless that too is already here, of course. The point is that you won’t know until it’s too late. Continue reading...","Mon, 25 Nov 2024 22:15:02 GMT",0.0,0.9295
The Guardian,Freedom by Angela Merkel review – settling scores with silence,"The former German chancellor slights her enemies by barely mentioning them – and is frustratingly opaque on her own big callsTowards the end of her 16-year tenure, former German chancellor Angela Merkel was garlanded with superlative titles: the “queen of Europe”, the “most powerful woman in the world”, the “leader of the free world”. In reality, her role was always more that of a mediator than a sovereign. Born and brought up for 35 years in an anti-church, Moscow-allied socialist command economy but politically active for 31 years in a Christian, staunchly pro-Nato and pro-market conservative party, Merkel’s unique political calling card was her ability to see eye-to-eye with politicians from opposing camps, because she understood their ideological hinterland.And so Freedom, released just three years after she left office, was never going to be a score-settling kind of autobiography. Meetings with politicians as different as George W Bush and former leftwing Greek prime minister Aléxis Tsípras are recalled with equal respect and affection – even though Merkel concludes that the former’s war in Iraq was “a mistake, waged on a basis of mistaken beliefs”, and the latter provides her with “the most astonishing moment of any phone call in my entire political career”, when he tells her he will recommend that the Greek people vote against a bailout deal he himself negotiated with her.

We’re fortunate to play so much Test cricket compared to other nations, so you can rattle them up rather quickly. But I’ve had to work hard and overcome different challenges along the way, so I’m very grateful to have had so many chances.”A minute earlier Root had been uncertain when I asked him if he knew what it would mean were he to score another 625 Test runs. A modest and generous man, Root thought hard and then admitted he had no clue. The answer is that, once those runs have been accumulated, he will become the second highest scorer in Test cricket. He will overtake Rahul Dravid, Jacques Kallis and Ricky Ponting and trail only Sachin Tendulkar. Continue reading...","Mon, 25 Nov 2024 20:00:04 GMT",0.0,0.9168

It was already dark by the time she and her then husband, Scott, got to the hotel; she couldn’t see the ocean, but could smell the saltwater of a beach vacation. The next morning, she had just stepped out of the shower when water started flooding their sea-level bungalow. Thinking the water main had broken, they called the front desk. No answer. Outside the bungalow, they saw the remnants of what they assumed was a rogue wave. “The lexicon, the word tsunami, was not in our brain,” Xaver recalled.Twenty years on, she remembers standing in an open-air beach restaurant, about 40ft behind Scott, watching another wave approach. A journalist by training, she pulled out her camera to record it. Through the lens, she saw the wave scoop up a Toyota pick-up truck and carry it toward her. “It wasn’t a wall of water, like a Hawaii Five-0 with a curve,” she remembered. “It was just raised water coming at you. I will never, ever forget it.” She had enough time to yell to her husband and jump on a beach chair before she was underwater. Continue reading...","Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:48:37 GMT",0.296,-0.2025

If you’re not feeling markedly better off already then the new prime minister is clearly a dud. No matter that it actually might take years to turn around an economy that has been on its knees for more than a decade. Just never give Labour an even break. Keir Starmer is like a Premier League manager after a run of bad results. On borrowed time.At least that’s what the likes of Nigel Farage and Elon Musk would have you believe.

The Guardian,"‘I took one pill and my whole body was gone’: Kathy Bates on opioids, ageing and selfish co-stars","As she stars in new legal serial Matlock, about a lawyer using people’s prejudices about older people to her advantage, the Oscar-winner opens up about surviving cancer, the Sacklers and watching herself on screenKathy Bates plays an elegant game in Sky’s new reboot of the 1980s legal drama Matlock. She’s the eponymous lawyer Matty, forced out of retirement having fallen upon hard times, thanks to her no-good husband. Or at least that’s what she says. There’s a lot of mischievous observation about ageism and the opportunities it presents: people look through her, so she can glide past security guards; people underestimate her, so she can bedevil them in negotiations; people shout over her like she isn’t there, so she destroys them in a way that’s pleasing to watch.At first glance, this seems to be a straightforward whodunnit. But Bates would never have taken the role, she says, if that’s all there was to it. The show is certainly enjoyable, warming even, a bit like being hugged. Whether Madeline “Matty” Matlock is appearing in her assumed persona (cuddly, wise) or her true identity (passionate, crusading), she is always agreeably on the side of the angels. “We’ve had responses from people across all ages, across all demographics,” says Bates. “It is a comforting thing to be able to put your mind somewhere else, to something entertaining, that also has a bit of a mystery. People need that right now – to get away from everything and get lost.” Continue reading...","Mon, 25 Nov 2024 15:46:09 GMT",-0.4767,0.9907
The Guardian,Kendrick Lamar: GNX review – stunning surprise from a rapper determined to be the greatest,"(PGLang/Interscope) After his beef with Drake, Lamar expands his list of targets with enthralling rhymes and adventurous arrangements. At this point, he’s deferring only to GodBy nature, hip-hop feuds are divisive, but the beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar was polarising in a way that had nothing to do with whose side you took. There were people who thought it was the greatest rap battle in history, outstripping Jay-Z and Nas, Ice Cube and his former bandmates in NWA, even Biggie and Tupac. Equally, there were others who questioned if it even counted as a rap battle at all: noting that both participants were already superstars, rather than a “young, hungry MC using this as a vehicle to get to the next place”, veteran critic Nelson George described it as “rich Black men attacking other rich Black men on their social media, from the comfort of their own homes”. But whatever stance you took, it was obvious who the winner was. Lamar’s Not Like Us not only landed a knockout blow, it achieved things no diss track has done before: it went to No 1, affected the campaign messaging of US election, became an American sports anthem, inspired a video game, was nominated for five Grammys – including record and song of the year – and got Lamar tapped as the headliner of the 2025 Super Bowl half-time show.It is a victory that seems to power GNX, a surprise release that couldn’t be more different in tone from Lamar’s last album Mr Morale and the Big Steppers, which spent 75 minutes thrashing about, filled with self-criticism and doubt, contemplating the inevitable end of his moment in the spotlight and reassuring himself that “you can’t please everyone” on a track called Crown. No such issues on GNX, an album that covers a lot of different topics – from romance on two duets with SZA, to the dissolution of Lamar’s Black Hippy collective – but on which the overall message seems to be: who else wants some? “It used to be ‘fuck that nigga’, but now it’s plural,” he offers on the opening Wacced Out Murals. So it seems. Although Drake gets it in the neck again, what’s striking is how his targets have now expanded to include Snoop Dogg (who posted a link to Drake’s diss track Taylor Made on social media), Lil Wayne (who was apparently aggrieved about Lamar’s Super Bowl slot), those with “old-ass flows”, people who offer “backhanded compliments”, sundry unnamed figures accused of trying to “hate on me” in Peekaboo and, potentially, Lamar’s own grandma, whom he threatens to cut off “if she don’t see it like I see it” during TV Off.

So you’re trapped in a space that’s no longer useful to you.”Pretty soon, in fact amazingly quickly, people were using the word to describe everything – to the extent that Doctorow wondered this year whether we’d entered the “enshittocene”. Repurposed to describe the effects of the climate crisis, it means something different, but just as evocative: say we sail beyond 1.5C of warming but do manage to stick at 2C, there will be dramatic, life-threatening events, there will be mass migration, but there will also be a general, broad-brush worsening of everything.

The Guardian,Who is really escalating the war in Ukraine? It certainly isn’t the west | James Nixey,"The policy of the US and Europe remains the same: drip-feeding resources while never giving Ukraine the chance to push Russia outJames Nixey leads the Russia-Eurasia programme at Chatham HouseEven for a country that has been at war for more than 1,000 days, the past month has been rough for Ukraine: its nemesis, Russia, has acquired 11,000 troops from North Korea and mercenaries from Yemen to assist in its project to delete Ukraine. Russia has also pulverised Ukraine’s energy grid with renewed ferocity as temperatures fall below freezing and fired off experimental intermediate-range weaponry, and it continues to make gains in the east. As if that weren’t enough, Russia’s preferred candidate has been elected as the American president, promising to end the war in “24 hours” – and not in Ukraine’s favour.And yet after all this, the question I have been asked continuously over the past week is: “Is the west escalating the war?” The question refers to the rescinding of some of the limitations imposed on Ukraine which forbade it from using western missiles to strike inside Russian territory. Far from being escalatory, western policy on the war is in fact best described as incrementalism – a drip-feed release of weaponry, which keeps Ukraine on a lifeline but certainly doesn’t allow it the possibility of pushing Russia out. The reason it has not been given this opportunity is twofold.James Nixey leads the Russia-Eurasia programme at Chatham HouseDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Barclays’ retreat over regulator’s Qatari finding is a cop-out,"Bank still does not accept FCA finding that payments of £322m to Qatari entities should have been disclosedA regulatory ruling that your conduct was “reckless and lacked integrity” is meant to be a highly serious matter for a bank. Thus it was understandable two years ago that Barclays decided to appeal against a £50m fine imposed by the Financial Conduct Authority that related to the disclosure of controversial payments to Qatari investors as part of a 2008 fund raising during the depths of the great financial crisis.Even in 2022, events from 2008 will have felt like ancient history, but if Barclays thought it did nothing wrong, there was still the principle of the thing – and, one assumes, a sense of an obligation to defend the reputations of former executives given that the Serious Fraud Office’s cases against four of them (and the bank itself) had already failed.

The Guardian,‘Woke’ didn’t lose the US election: the patrician class who hijacked identity politics did | Nesrine Malik,"Why is this simple explanation being so widely embraced? Because it does not require a commitment to real, structural changeThe day that wokeness died. That has been one of the primary analyses of Donald Trump’s resounding election victory: that it was a resounding rejection of the “woke” left and the casting off of the shackles of political correctness. According to sections of the media and political establishment, people are tired of being harangued and scolded for not using the right language, annoyed by a constant focus on race and identity, and alarmed by a new orthodoxy of radical politics eager to please individual groups at the expense of common sense. “The era,” summarised one British journalist, “of Black Lives Matter, Latinx, critical race theory, pronouns and defunding the police is over.” It’s a neat conclusion – it’s hard not to see this result as a rejection of something. But was that something “woke” values in particular?As a starting point, it is worth looking at Kamala Harris’s campaign rather than the assumptions about it. In reality, she seemed to avoid any focus on identity and “wokeness”. She didn’t make much of her race, or even her gender, choosing instead to ground her identity in her background as a middle-class person raised in a rental household by a hardworking mother. Her position on race softened from when she was running in 2019: she previously backed “some form” of reparations but did not stake out a position as part of her bid. Trump wanted Harris “to say something to turn off white voters. She was wise not to take the bait,” wrote the author Keith Boykin. She was hardline on immigration, keen to show that she is a gun owner (memorably telling Oprah Winfrey: “If someone breaks into my house they’re getting shot”). And she was evasive on gender-affirming care for transgender Americans.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on benefit reforms: ministers should enable work – not force it | Editorial,"Years of ugly attacks on benefit claimants mean Liz Kendall treads a delicate line as she sets out to boost employment That one in eight young people in the UK are not in education, employment or training is a dismal statistic. Nearly a decade after the school-leaving age was raised to 18 in England (in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland it remains 16), and 25 years after Tony&nbsp;Blair aimed to have 50% of young people in higher education, Britain under the Tories went backwards.The problem of a shrinking workforce, and the rising benefits bill it entails, is not limited to young adults. The UK’s lack of a post-pandemic bounceback in employment is a concern in other age groups, particularly the over-50s. But the government is right to be alarmed by the phenomenon of young people emerging from 14 years of schooling unable to work or undertake training. Unemployment and long-term illness are not a great start to anyone’s adult life.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Romania’s presidential election: a stable Ukrainian ally wobbles | Editorial,"The shock first-round victory of a far-right nationalist candidate has far-reaching and alarming implicationsIn a region shadowed by Vladimir Putin’s revanchist ambitions, Romania has been a pillar of pro‑western stability. Possessing a long border with Ukraine, the country has been a staunch ally to its neighbour under the outgoing president, Klaus Iohannis. As well as providing military aid, more than half a million refugees have been accommodated, and Ukrainian grain exports have been facilitated through the Black Sea port of Constanta. During the summer, President Iohannis at one point threw his hat into the ring to become Nato’s new secretary general, a post eventually filled by the Netherlands’ former prime minister, Mark Rutte.Disturbingly, this bulwark status is now in extreme jeopardy after one of the most remarkable election results in Romania’s post-1989 history. The little‑known far-right independent Călin Georgescu, who topped the poll and now goes into a second-round runoff in December, is a virulent critic of Nato and aid to Ukraine, a vocal admirer of Donald Trump and has suggested Romanian foreign policy should take note of “Russian wisdom”. Mr Georgescu’s brand of insular Christian nationalism shares similarities with Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán. Ahead of a crucial period after Mr Trump’s re-election, his rise from nowhere risks undermining the fragile consensus underpinning European solidarity with Kyiv.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,A fairer system would make paying taxes more palatable | Letters,"Most reasonable people can see that taxes are necessary to fund public services, says John Harradence. Plus letters from Tom Kelly and Ian ArnottRafael Behr (Labour wants tax rises to fall on the ‘broadest shoulders’. The farmers furore shows why that’s so hard to achieve, 20 November) makes many good points – but I think a key issue he missed is the perception of fairness. Junior doctors were incensed by the fact that their pay relative to others had stagnated. They work as hard as anyone and this erosion of their pay was generally felt to be unfair, so their industrial action attracted widespread public support. Farmers equally feel unfairly singled out over inheritance tax, especially when, in the same week, Rachel Reeves eased the rules on bankers’ bonuses.Nobody likes paying tax, but most reasonable people can see that it is necessary to fund public services. The way to sell taxes to the public is by developing a fairer tax system and being honest about the implications of any changes. If&nbsp;sliding scales were used (ie&nbsp;gradual increases) instead of tax bands, I think it would help. This should apply to income tax, inheritance tax and council tax.John HarradenceColwall Green, Herefordshire Continue reading...","Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:18:29 GMT",0.4391,0.8596

I have just been made redundant, along with three other PAs at my practice. This is happening across the country. The NHS has invested in training and employing thousands of us for 20 years, only to now pull the rug out from under us and end our careers, losing skilled workers from a system that is under strain. And for what?The cases mentioned in your editorial (21 November) where errors were made are sad, but not unique to the PA role. I was a team leader of 12 allied health professionals and worked hard to provide excellent patient care. The system has been using us as a cheaper resource because it has been able to get away with it, and then framed it that we are the problem. The emotional and financial impact of this on PAs is huge.

The Guardian,Liverpool’s contract dance with Salah was always going to be complicated,"Revamp after Jürgen Klopp’s exit didn’t help and now time is short for club to make their talisman feel wanted againMohamed Salah’s admission that he is “more out than in” at Liverpool creates a tremor in an otherwise serene debut season for Arne Slot. The Liverpool head coach can take comfort in the fact there is zero evidence to support Salah’s claim on the pitch and, while he and sporting director Richard Hughes are new to the club, contract posturing by the Anfield superstar is not.Salah rarely stops to give post-match interviews but what happened at Southampton on Sunday was not unusual in many respects. There was the removal of the shirt following a match‑winning goal that invited a yellow card but also revealed a chiselled physique. Just in case anyone is still wondering what condition he is in at 32. Another decisive job done, with Liverpool sitting eight points clear at the top of the Premier League after his 11th and 12th goals of the season, and Salah seized his next opportunity, telling waiting reporters he was disappointed not to have received a formal contract offer and a resolution is “not in my hands”.

The Guardian,"A mystery in Finnish Lapland, and what it means for the climate crisis – podcast","Biodiversity and environment reporter Patrick Greenfield travels to Finnish Lapland to investigate the disappearance of its carbon sink, and its implications for the fight against global heatingFinland has one of the most ambitious carbon-neutral goals in the world: to reach net zero by 2035. If this feels like a bold pledge, there’s good reason for it: two-thirds of the country is covered in forests, that have for decades absorbed more carbon dioxide than they have put out.But recently, something has changed: Finland’s carbon sink is no longer working. In fact, in barely over a decade, its forests and peatlands have become a net emitter of carbon dioxide … with devastating consequences for the country’s climate goals.

The Guardian,How having babies became so political - video,"The pronatalist movement in the US is gathering pace once again, rekindled by Silicon Valley personalities and hard-right conservatives who are becoming increasingly vocal about whether or not women are having enough babies. But it's not just in the US, some governments in other countries have launched marketing campaigns encouraging people to have more children, while others have offered financial incentives. But while many of these policies claim to be about halting population decline, there are other factors at play. Josh Toussaint-Strauss interrogates efforts around the world to boost birth rates, as well as the underlying political motivations, from bodily autonomy to immigrationBirthrates are plummeting worldwide. Can governments turn the tide?When desperate measures to persuade women to have children fail, it’s time for fresh thinking Continue reading...","Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:33:44 GMT",0.0,0.9161

The Guardian,The big picture: earthbound reality at the International Space Station landing site in Kazakhstan,"Andrew McConnell’s shot of a young scrap collector at the remote spot where astronauts return from space captures a curious juxtapositionThe photographer Andrew McConnell first went to Kazakhstan in 2015, to witness what the Earth’s primary space portal looked like on the ground. A particular corner of the remote steppe-land, near a village called Kenjebai-Samai, was where, every three months, astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station fell to earth, having been launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome 400 miles to the south. McConnell had spent much of the previous years working in war zones and was keen to focus on something more life-affirming.He discovered a curious landscape that was both on the frontier of human exploration and unchanged for centuries. Over a dozen visits in the subsequent years, McConnell became used to the rhythm of the landings. He would sleep out on the steppe in a tent with the ground crew of the Russian space agency; on hearing the explosion that heralded the capsule separating in the sky above, they would drive out over the wasteland to meet it as it landed – a vehicle no bigger than a family car.Some Worlds Have Two Suns by Andrew McConnell is published by Gost (£60) Continue reading...","Sun, 24 Nov 2024 07:00:04 GMT",0.0,0.5994

The Guardian,We shall satirise him on the beaches… Churchill through the eyes of cartoonists – in pictures,"In one wartime image, Winston Churchill is portrayed as a dragonslayer; in another, a gun-toting gangster. Later, he appears old and dejected, overdue for retirement. The cartoons, on show in a new exhibition at the Imperial War Museum London, show a multitude of Churchills, reflecting how he was seen in different countries and at different times, from 1909 onwards. “There was never a consensus view of him,” says curator Kate Clements. “Some of the depictions were heavily critical and even grotesque”, while others “depict his determined nature and portray him as a British figurehead”. Clements hopes the exhibition will “add another layer to our visitors’ understanding of this complex individual” and show “how satirical cartoons played a part in shaping perceptions of Churchill during his lifetime and beyond”.Churchill in Cartoons: Satirising a Statesman is at the Imperial War Museum, London from Friday to 23 February 2025 Continue reading...","Sat, 23 Nov 2024 17:00:02 GMT",0.0,-0.7717
