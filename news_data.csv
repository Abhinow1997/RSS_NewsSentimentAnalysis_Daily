The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Russian missile strike kills at least four in central town,"Rescue operation under way, Zelenskyy says, after more than a dozen also wounded in Dnipropetrovsk region. What we know on day 1,012See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverageA Russian missile strike on a town in Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region on Saturday killed at least four people, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. More than a dozen others were wounded, including a child, while a residential building and shop were damaged, according to officials. Zelenskyy said a rescue operation was under way. Tsarychanka is about 50km (30 miles) north of Dnipro, the region’s capital.Former UK ambassador to Russia Sir Tony Brenton has said Zelenskyy is “playing a very sophisticated game” in calling for Ukrainian-controlled territories to come under the “Nato umbrella”. But he added that the Ukrainian president had made “quite a major concession” in stating he was prepared to see a ceasefire and then negotiate the return of Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine over the long term. Zelenskyy earlier suggested that Ukrainian territory under his control should be taken under the Nato umbrella to try to stop the “hot stage” of the war with Russia. He told Sky News that such a proposal has “never been considered” by Ukraine because it has never “officially” been offered.Ukraine came under attack from 10 Russian drones, of which eight were shot down over the Kyiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk and Kherson regions, the air force said on Saturday. One drone returned to Russian-occupied territory, while the final drone disappeared from radar, often a sign of the use of electronic defences.Eleven Ukrainian drones had been shot down by Russia’s air defences, its defence ministry said. The mayor of Sochi, Andrey Proshunin, and the head of Russia’s Dagestan region, Sergey Melikov, both in Russia’s south-west, said drones had been destroyed in their regions overnight to Saturday. No casualties were reported.Ukraine has asked Latin American parliamentarians and diplomats to assist in its defence in the war with Russia. Representatives of Argentina, Belize, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, El Salvador, Ecuador, Peru and Costa Rica came to Kyiv for a meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Police in North Macedonia arrested a Macedonian national suspected of intending to join the Russian army and fight in Ukraine, according to the country’s interior ministry. It is the first case of a Macedonian national facing the specific charge. The man, identified only as JK, faces a minimum three-year sentence if convicted. The ministry said the suspect had been in online contact with a person who had introduced himself as tasked by the Russian army to recruit soldiers for a compensation of €3,000 ($3,175). The suspect flew to Moscow in October and on returning to North Macedonia a week later was interrogated at Skopje airport. Continue reading...","Sun, 01 Dec 2024 02:34:12 GMT",-0.836,-0.9921

The Guardian,Game of Throws: Inside Darts review – captures all the jubilant anarchy of one of the world’s greatest sports,"Every tiny moment of darts’ ascendance to an even higher level – and the birth of a superstar – is captured in this retrospective of last year’s world championship. Also there are men in fancy dress as chickensIs darts the best sport in the world? If it isn’t, it’s certainly a heavyweight contender and it’s bang in form, with the coming of the current golden age confirmed during the extraordinary 2024 PDC World Championship. Game of Throws, a three-part reminiscence about those three dramatic weeks in London a year ago, successfully bottles the moment.More of a collective mania than a game, darts asks participants to throw tiny metal spikes at targets the width of a fingertip from more than two metres away, a ludicrously difficult discipline that requires years of diligent practice. Wins and losses are measured in millimetres. So one might expect elite tournaments to take place in a reverential hush, like chess or snooker. But no: the major career landmarks of darts pros happen in cacophonous halls full of drunk punters in fancy dress. Continue reading...","Sat, 30 Nov 2024 22:00:37 GMT",0.8481,0.705
The Guardian,How I brought a Jewish wartime refugee’s lost fairytale back to life,"Ulrich Boschwitz, who wrote the recently rediscovered thriller The Passenger, left another gift behind him when his life was tragically cut short. I had the honour of reinterpreting it for today’s childrenThis story begins in a fever. It was the spring of 2021 and I’d contracted my first bout of Covid. Confined to bed, I turned to the pile of books that had been staring at me guiltily for weeks, if not months. The one I pulled out was a soon-to-be released noir-ish thriller called The Passenger. It was set in the Germany of the 1930s, following a man on the run from the Nazi authorities, hoping to make his escape by hopping on and off trains crisscrossing the country. As the Gestapo net around him tightens, he plunges into paranoia and breakdown. Perhaps the coronavirus&nbsp;intensified the experience, but I was gripped. I tweeted that it was part Franz Kafka, part John Buchan and completely riveting.But there was a twist. This was not a new book, but one written nearly a century earlier. The author was Ulrich Alexander Boschwitz, just 23 years old when his novel was published in 1938 and a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany. In 1935, he had made his way across Europe to reach Britain, where he was promptly classified as an “enemy alien” and interned in a camp on the Isle of Man. He was held with more than a thousand other émigrés, among them a remarkable number of artists, musicians, writers and intellectuals&nbsp;on what Simon Parkin has called the&nbsp;island of extraordinary captives.

Most are clad in the ubiquitous slime green that adorned the cover of June’s culture-swallowing Brat album, while some sport the same wraparound glasses as their unapologetic idol. Everyone is dancing in unison to Apple, a curious bop about nature v nurture, fruit and airports, that went viral thanks to a TikTok dance. The Essex 32-year-old nonchalantly waves her cigarette like a baton, controlling an orchestra of mainly gay men and young women, before unleashing a familiar trigger warning for an oncoming crowd meltdown: “Manchester, where the fuck you at?” she roars as delirium ensues.It’s an unexpected spectacle. When this short UK arena tour was first announced in April, it felt slightly overambitious for a peripheral but hugely influential pop star. Charli’s flirtations with mainstream success – Boom Clap, Fancy, 1999 – were often sandwiched between more outre experimentations with various affiliates of gonzo UK electronic label PC Music, moving her into “if you know, you know” territory.

The Guardian,Australia’s rapid turnaround following proven Joe Schmidt blueprint | Daniel Gallan,"Despite defeat against Ireland, recent progress shows what is possible – and that the Wallabies have the right coachThe last time Australia won in Dublin, in November 2013, Joe Schmidt was sitting in the other coaching box having just taken control of an Ireland team in disarray. Declan Kidney had presided over a fifth-place finish in the Six Nations, Ireland’s worst result since the competition was expanded to include Italy. Having steered Leinster to back-to-back Heineken Cup wins, Schmidt was tasked with converting domestic dominance into global supremacy.His first assignment against tier-one opposition was the visit of the Wallabies. After a “performance without spirit, urgency, or accuracy,” as the Observer’s Eddie Butler concluded, Ireland were spanked 32-15. But Schmidt had a plan and a year later he claimed his first of three Six Nations titles and would leave the post after a win rate of 72% from 76 Tests, a grand slam in 2018 and World Rugby’s coach of the year award for catapulting Ireland to the top of the world rankings for the first time.

The Guardian,Jamal Musiala hits back for Bayern Munich to break Dortmund hearts,"Jamal Musiala ran away patting his head in wonderment but, even if nodded equalisers are hardly his stock-in-trade, there was little to feel surprised about. Bayern Munich had been knocking on the door all half against opponents who never looked secure and eventually they did as they have all season, averting defeat and fending off any breathless predictions of a revived Bundesliga title race. Of course it was Musiala, who had already won them two games in November, rising above the mean on Germany’s highest stage.The tale of how Musiala was lost to England is well told by now. So the real story here was about someone who may shine in his stead; a player whose first senior call-up is surely a matter of time. Jamie Gittens illuminated this fixture, a modern-era classic in name and nature, by scoring a sensational goal just before the half-hour and tormenting Bayern all night from his perch on the left. If he lies on the periphery of public consciousness back home, perhaps now is the moment to remember his name. While a flagging Dortmund could not complain about being pegged back, their 20-year-old winger deserved to be on the winning side. Continue reading...","Sat, 30 Nov 2024 19:46:59 GMT",0.6486,0.8278

The world No 1 capitalised on mistakes from his misfiring opponent to exact some measure of revenge for defeats in finals in Xian and Belfast this season.While Trump produced nothing like the form he showed when he swept aside Zhang Anda in the last eight, it proved more than enough to line him up for another shot at the&nbsp;prestigious trophy he lifted in&nbsp;2011.

The Guardian,We need to talk about capitalism. Why won’t Labour do it?,"The government has its five missions. But the deeper cause of Britain’s malaise is the unhealthy and unhappy nature of the modern economyWe often hear how ministers should be more honest about the state of the economy. How they should signal their intentions and, before announcing a policy shift, have the guts and intellectual heft to debate the expected impact in public, such that when a section of the public dislikes the plan, at least they understand why it has been set in motion.It was a message Rachel Reeves absorbed and used as a defence for her first budget in October, only to come unstuck when she shocked businesses with a previously undiscussed change to the terms of employer national insurance contributions and an ill-considered last-minute grab at farmers’ incomes via a rise in inheritance tax.

The excesses of the Iron Guard, an insurrectionary, violently antisemitic, ultranationalist 1930s political-religious militia, stood out even at a time when fascist parties were wreaking havoc in Germany, Italy and Spain. Given what is happening in Europe today, the events of that period are instructive.Iron Guard founder Corneliu Codreanu, a ruthless assassin who was himself assassinated in 1938, and his ally turned enemy, the pro-Nazi general Ion Antonescu, who was executed for war crimes in 1946, are back in the news of late. That’s because both men have been lauded as national heroes by Călin Georgescu, shock winner of last weekend’s first round of Romania’s presidential election.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Wicked would be fun and forgettable but for the alt-right waging its dark arts against it | Kate Maltby,"Digital crusade by anti-woke warriors against a vapid film for teen girls should be sending a wake-up call to HollywoodThe “war on woke” has a new target and her name is the Wicked Witch of the West. If you’re a fan of the musical Wicked, you’ll also know her as Elphaba, the moniker imagined by Gregory Maguire in his 1995 prequel to L Frank Baum’s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. As played by Margaret Hamilton in the 1939 movie, she was the nemesis of Judy Garland’s Dorothy; as played this year by the musical theatre star Cynthia Erivo, she has conservative men across Britain and America bursting their blood vessels.Since Maguire came up with his novel – an extravagant piece of fan-fiction that suggests this “witch” might simply have been misunderstood – it has been reinterpreted as a stage musical and now as a movie in two parts. Wicked’s target market consists of teenage girls who see themselves in this backstory for Elphaba and her college-friend-turned-rival, Glinda the Good Witch. In the 21 years since Stephen Schwartz’s adaptation opened on Broadway, the show has been a cult phenomenon among young musical fans, blithely ignored by everyone else. Now the screen version has brought into mainstream conversation and the land of Oz has become a battleground in America’s culture war.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Good palliative care can alleviate the pain of dying – this bill means Labour must fund it | Rachel Clarke,"Making dying easier is not the solution when NHS, social and palliative care are simply not there for patientsThe succession of former prime ministers who lined up in recent days to assert their compassion for the dying was quite something. David Cameron, Theresa May, Liz Truss, Boris Johnson – all of them wanting us to know just how much they cared. Imagine if this roll call of political powerhouses – each of whom was better placed than anyone to improve the fate of those with terminal diagnoses – had used that power, while in office, to do something concrete, tangible, to alleviate the terminal suffering that allegedly touched them so deeply. Imagine, in other words, if their actions then had matched their fine words now.I don’t doubt the strength of feeling behind this vote in favour of legalising assisted dying in England and Wales, but as someone who has cared for thousands of people with terminal illnesses, I have to wonder at its sincerity. Because every prime minister over the last 20 years – and every MP for that matter – knows full well that much (though not all) of the pain and misery of dying can be alleviated with good palliative care. They also know how much suffering at the end of life is caused by basic NHS, social and palliative care simply not being there for patients. Wes Streeting went one step further. The health secretary cited the threadbare realities of our underfunded, patchy, palliative care services as his primary reason for voting against the bill, stating (correctly) that the postcode lottery in care denies many patients a genuine choice at the end of life.Rachel Clarke is a palliative care doctor and the author of Breathtaking: Inside the NHS in a Time of Pandemic Continue reading...","Sat, 30 Nov 2024 07:00:20 GMT",0.4215,0.9566
The Guardian,The Observer view on the disturbing prevalence of child sexual abuse in the home | Observer editorial,"The idea of children being abused within their family is too upsetting for adults to contemplate. But we must‘I wanted them all to notice.” This is the title of a new report on protecting children from sexual abuse within the family, taken from an interview with a child who was sexually abused and failed by the agencies that should have protected them. The report by the Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel (CSPRP) reviewed 136 cases of serious child sexual abuse from between 2018 and 2023, including the way in which children’s services responded. It sets out the horrific extent to which children are so often abandoned by the system and denied the safeguarding and support they desperately need.Child sexual abuse is far more common than many people realise. At least one in 10 children will be sexually abused before the age of 16, with survey data suggesting girls are three times as likely to experience it, and disabled children twice as likely as non-disabled children. In the cases reviewed by the panel, 98% of the abusers were men. Continue reading...","Sat, 30 Nov 2024 19:00:33 GMT",-0.8176,-0.9944
The Guardian,The Observer view: Shaky ceasefire is no victory for Netanyahu amid suffering of Gaza and hostages,"Despite the Lebanon truce, Israel’s prime minister shows no desire to seek peace with HamasFor the people of Lebanon, last week’s agreement to halt the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah comes as a huge relief. The 14-month conflict, sparked by the 7 October 2023 Hamas terrorist atrocities, caused about 4,000 deaths, inflicted appalling destruction and displaced hundreds of thousands of residents on either side of the Israel-Lebanon border. Now there is a semblance of calm. Long may it last.For the people of Israel, the ceasefire appears more of a mixed blessing. Prime minister Benjamin&nbsp;Netanyahu has declared a&nbsp;famous victory. He says Israelis who fled Hezbollah’s rockets may safely return home – though not yet. It’s undoubtedly true that Hezbollah’s military capabilities and leadership have been significantly degraded. Given Hezbollah joined the conflict to support Hamas, it follows that Hamas has been further&nbsp;weakened by the humbling of a key ally.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But some warned that fragile progress could disappear again in the last stages of negotiations over the weekend.For some time, the talks have been split over demands for the treaty to include plans to reduce the amount of plastic that is being produced – a production cap. A draft text for a final deal published on Friday included language for a global target to reduce the amount of plastic made. But it also included another option for no text – meaning no action would be taken to reduce plastic production worldwide.

But as more of us try to make sustainable choices, the idea of discarding a real tree come January can feel wasteful. The alternative – artificial trees – presents both a solution and a problem.Each type of tree – real, potted, rented or fake – has its benefits and drawbacks, while the right fit for each household will come down to various factors, including space, cost, care and lifestyle. As the Carbon Trust puts it: “The most sustainable choice will depend on the tree, your plans for reuse, then options for disposal.” Continue reading...","Thu, 28 Nov 2024 17:41:03 GMT",0.6369,0.9638

The Guardian,"All We Imagine As Light review – Cannes prize-winning Indian drama is a quiet, tender marvel","Payal Kapadia’s poetic, everyday tale of three women who work at the same hospital is all the more remarkable for being her fiction feature debutMumbai is more than a city. It’s an ever-expanding universe. Night shots of the thronged streets in this exquisite, Cannes prize-winning drama by Mumbai-born documentary director turned fiction film-maker Payal Kapadia show the skyline as a shimmering constellation of lights. And behind each flickering window, inside every snaking commuter train, there is a whole world with its own myriad of stories. It’s an idea that Kapadia acknowledges with elegant simplicity at the film’s opening, using documentary techniques, a montage of street scenes and the voices of migrants from around the country drawn to the city for work.Having captured the teeming collision of lives, she gently guides us to follow three of them. Nurse Prabha (Kani Kusruti) is a veteran at the busy urban hospital where all three work; her younger colleague Anu (Divya Prabha), newly arrived from the south of India, is caught up in the first thrill of romance with her Muslim boyfriend. And Pavarty (Chhaya Kadam), a cook in the hospital kitchen, is facing eviction from a home that is due to be demolished to sate the voracious appetite of gentrification. The women speak different languages – Prabha and Anu converse in Malayalam; Hindi and Marathi are also used. These are ordinary lives, with small sadnesses, twinging regrets and sparks of joy. But through Kapadia’s empathetic lens we realise that these women, like the city that never entirely feels like home for any of them, contain multitudes.In UK and Irish cinemas Continue reading...","Sat, 30 Nov 2024 15:00:29 GMT",0.4215,0.8826

He has been humble about this, but the fact that ‘Fleetwood Mac: guitarist/vocalist’ is just one of the entries on his CV speaks indelibly about his achievements. He respectfully crashed the gates of Buckingham Palace.The first time Crowded House appeared on a stage in Perth was in 1987 at the long ago demolished Entertainment Centre. They were so hot right then; flotsam jetsam in outlook, comedic and poignant and dazzle-may-care, with all their vocal and instrumental chops in play. They were breaking the US, having already burst into our hearts, with Finn out front leading bassist Nick Seymour and late drummer Paul Hester (and touring keyboardist Eddie Rayner). They opened with the first track from their recently released self-titled debut album produced by Mitchell Froom, who now plays keyboards in the band.

The Guardian,Meet the Rees-Moggs: this is impeccable reality TV – but should the ex-MP be allowed on our screens?,"Trump, Farage and Hancock have done it. Now, the ex-Conservative minister joins the list seeking to reinvent himself via reality TV – is it really ok, though?We have to start by getting all of the Jacob Rees-Mogg caveats out of the way: Jacob Rees-Mogg is staunchly anti-abortion, even in cases of incest and rape; Jacob Rees-Mogg is still, amazingly, pro-Brexit; Jacob Rees-Mogg admires the political machinations of Nigel Farage and Donald Trump; Jacob Rees-Mogg once slouched down in Parliament in a way that made Caroline Lucas get mad at him. Then we have to cover the “MPs on television” caveats: Matt Hancock shouldn’t have been allowed to reform his image on I’m a Celebrity, Farage shouldn’t have been either, and while I’m at it I don’t like Ed Balls on Good Morning Britain. Now all the caveats are out of the way, a fun one just for me: Jacob Rees-Mogg looks like an umbrella Dracula threw away so he wouldn’t have to take too much baggage on to the ship Demeter. There. Now we can get going.All that is to say, Jacob Rees-Mogg this week launches a reality show on Discovery+ (from Monday). It’s one of those statements that makes you feel you perhaps made the wrong sandwich choice once in 2014, leapt on to an alternative timeline as a direct result, and now we’re here. But no: ham and cheese was correct, this is really happening. His wife Helena is in it, his various children are in it, his castle is in it, his SW1 townhouse is in it, his nanny is in it, a man called Sean who buffs his vintage Bentley is in it, his mother – whom he calls “Lady Rees-Mogg”! – is in it, the buildup to the 2024 general election is in it. There’s a lot of idle playing with cricket balls, dressing too formally for dinner at home, actually saying “yah”, and a big coordinated two-car drive to Boris Johnson’s birthday party. It has to-camera confessionals and scenes of unbelievably familiar domesticity and a few snatched glances of moments you can very much tell they would have preferred had not been captured in full HD by a crew. It is, by any measure you’ve got, fairly impeccable reality TV show-making. Continue reading...","Sat, 30 Nov 2024 07:00:20 GMT",0.0,0.75

Your reputation may have enhanced your prospects but, when it came to job hunting, your qualifications and CV were pretty much the only showcase you had.With the internet everything changed – and then changed again with social media and smartphones. Suddenly, you were visible to millions of people on a device they carried around in their pockets.

These tech companies are like octopuses with tentacles in so many different directions.
