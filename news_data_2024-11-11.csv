We’re calling it – he’s a dead cert for the glitterballFor 10 interminable seconds on Saturday night TV, the lights went out. Thankfully, it was deliberate. The Couple’s Choice routine performed on Strictly Come Dancing by blind comedian Chris McCausland included a “blackout moment”, where he danced in the dark to immerse viewers in his sightless world. It was a powerful and poignant interlude which was hailed by the judges as “absolutely spectacular”.This spine-tingling piece of television was reminiscent of the silent dance performed by actor Rose Ayling-Ellis, the show’s first deaf participant, in 2021. That routine would be voted Bafta’s Must-See Moment – as well as garnering a spot in our own hall of hoofing fame – and Ayling-Ellis went on to lift the glitterball trophy.

Because she feels nothingLook on the bright side. Kemi Badenoch lasted two and a half hours in the witness stand at the Post Office inquiry without losing it. She didn’t get into an argument with Jason Beer, the counsel for the crown, though that could be because his questions were not unduly threatening. After all, we were there to hear Kemi’s version of events. Other versions of the truth may be available. Nor did she square up to any of those in the public gallery who laughed when Beer thanked her for answering “some” of his questions.Not that Kemi nailed it. Like many narcissists, she is a curious mixture of the thick- and thin-skinned. She likes to present herself as a no-nonsense, tough woman. Someone who isn’t afraid to go toe-to-toe with her opponents. Who can tell it like it is. But beneath the surface there’s a vulnerability that she despises. It’s why she lashes out so readily.

The Guardian,"Vincent Valdez: the controversial artist tackling racism, violence and America","Artist rose to prominence for his Ku Klux Klan painting and now his provocative, powerful work is on exhibitionIn 2015, artist Vincent Valdez released his imposingly large painting The City I. The controversy that swiftly ignited upon its release had long been brewing even as Valdez was painting it. The 30ft black and white work shows over a dozen hooded Klansmen gathering rather portentously in the middle of the night. The painting, which many initially critiqued for unnecessarily referencing a long-past chapter in American race relations, quickly showed its relevancy – as it was arriving into the world, Klansman David Duke himself gave then candidate Donald Trump a presidential endorsement, and the four years of the first Trump presidency would embolden exactly the racial animus that Valdez had portrayed.Now, the first major museum survey of Valdez’s prodigious output is released on the eve of a second Trump presidency, when signs of the racism this second term is likely to unleash are already evident in the form of revolting text messages being sent to Black Americans. The City I is joined by works attesting to the sweep of Valdez’s artistic vision, showing it as not an isolated example of artistic prophecy but rather as a part of the uncannily accurate, unerring vision that Valdez has demonstrated as a painter.

The Guardian,Billionaires like Elon Musk don’t just think they’re better than the rest of us – they hate us | Zoe Williams,"The ultra-wealthy talk about solving the climate crisis or ending inequality. But what they’re really interested in is outliving or escaping anyone poorer than themNearly three years ago, I started working on an idea for a book. It started out with the pretty mild proposition: we’re in a class war, but it’s a weird one, because one side is curiously coy. The capital class used to strut its stuff. It used to build libraries and great estates; it used to tell you it thought it was superior, and why. Now that it is billionaires on one side and everyone else on the other, they are like ghosts. They might tell you what they think, in Ted Talks, at Davos, but it can’t be real: according to them, all they care about is fixing climate change, solving inequality and bringing about world peace. Mysteriously, none of those things ever come about.I dragged my feet a little bit, and while I did so, the billionaires got louder, and maybe truer to their authentic selves. Vladimir Putin, estimated to be worth billions, invaded Ukraine. Elon Musk bought Twitter. Sam Bankman-Fried got outed as not-a-billionaire – the billions turned out to either belong to someone else, be fictional, be priced in crypto, or all three – and a lot of his fantasies for the future came tumbling out in the same legal proceedings: a plan, stated in a memo, to purchase the sovereign nation of Nauru in order to construct a “bunker/shelter” that would be used for “some event where 50%-99.99% of people die [to] ensure that most EAs [effective altruists] survive” and to develop “sensible regulation around human genetic enhancement, and build a lab there”.

In a world awash with murky interests, it is rather important that we find out whyIt is a truth universally acknowledged that a man in possession of a fortune is usually dead keen to throw it at Prince Andrew.Because they keep on doing it, don’t they? They just can’t help themselves, from the oligarch son-in-law of Kazakhstan’s then president, who so obligingly paid £3m over the asking price for the Duke of York’s former marital home at Sunninghill Park, to the late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who so famously lent the duke’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson £15,000 to help clear her debts. Even after King Charles stopped paying his security bills, Andrew is believed to have found what the royal journalist Robert Hardman’s biography of the king delicately calls “other sources of income” related to his contacts in international trade – a phrase that makes you long for the good old days of Fergie gamely doing WeightWatchers ads to pay off her overdraft or Princess Anne’s son-in-law going on I’m A Celebrity to discuss her reaction to his novelty boxer shorts.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Far-right leaders are winning across the globe. Blaming ‘the economy’ or ‘the left-behinds’ won’t cut it | Richard Seymour,"The economy matters, but the likes of Trump succeed by offering voters revenge for problems both real and imaginedDonald Trump, for the first time, won a majority of the popular vote. He took the US presidency with huge swings in his favour, increasing his share of first-time voters, young voters, black voters and Latino voters. And he gained among voters earning under $100,000, while wealthier voters preferred Harris – a reversal of the class alignments in 2020. Current voting tallies suggest the swing to the Republicans was largely caused by mass abstention among Democrat voters. This result echoes global trends. Trump and his new coalition will now head a loose alliance of far-right governments from India to Hungary, Italy, the Philippines, Argentina, the Netherlands and Israel.The rhythm of far-right successes began with Viktor Orbán’s landslide in Hungary’s 2010 parliamentary election. Since Narendra Modi’s victory in the 2014 Indian general election, it has scarcely paused: Trump’s first ascent to the White House, the Brexit vote and Rodrigo Duterte’s success in the Philippines all took place in 2016. Two years later, Jair Bolsonaro scored an upset in Brazil. Since the pandemic, the Brothers of Italy won the Italian general election in 2022 and Javier Milei took the Argentinian presidency in 2023. For most of this period, Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud has ruled Israel in coalition with far-right parties. Even where it is not in power, the far right is gaining, as in France and Germany. In the long view, the defeat of Trump in 2020 and Bolsonaro in 2022 were predictable oscillations in a general pattern of ascent.Richard Seymour is an author and founding editor of Salvage.

The Guardian,"End of Treasury’s stake in NatWest is nigh, and no flashy sell-off required | Nils Pratley","State’s holding in former Royal Bank of Scotland down to 11.4%, without need for Jeremy Hunt’s planned £3bn saleSometime around spring next year, HM Treasury should finally sell its last share in NatWest, or the Royal Bank of Scotland, as it was. The process will only have taken 17 years. If that feels like an age, it is a shorter timespan than seemed likely only 12 months ago.At the end of the last year, the government’s stake – 84.9% after the two-stage nationalisation by the last Labour administration in 2008-09 – was still 38%. Now it is down to 11.4% after the latest “directed buy-back”, in which the bank bought shares from the Treasury for cancellation – in this case £1bn-worth.

The Guardian,UK universities are in crisis – and Labour has taken the first step towards saving them | Philip Augar,"The government is making welcome moves to overhaul a sector in financial turmoil, but institutions face tough choicesPhilip Augar chaired the May government’s review of post-18 education and fundingOne of Britain’s most globally successful industries is under financial pressure. More than a third of higher education institutions are running at a loss, a handful are at risk of government bailout and some have had to shed staff and courses. While Labour’s recent decision to allow a small increase in university tuition fees in England to £9,535 a year is not a complete solution, it sent a signal that the government is listening to the sector.Universities are part of a delicate post-18 education system, and they cannot be considered in isolation. Encouragingly, this gesture was one of a series of steps in the right direction. It started with the creation of Skills England just weeks after the general election. This new arm’s-length government body will administer the growth and skills fund, a levy on large employers now extended to other forms of training as well as apprenticeships.Philip Augar is a former banker and the author of several financial history books.

The Guardian,Not changing course on Gaza was a colossal mistake by Kamala Harris | Moustafa Bayoumi,"It was a fatal error certainly for Palestinians and quite likely, as we now see, for Americans, tooCould Kamala Harris have won the election if she had promised to change course in Gaza? It’s impossible to know, of course, but there’s reason to think so. Instead, Harris hewed far too closely to Biden’s position, alienating large numbers of voters along the way. The result? We can expect the catastrophe for the Palestinian people to continue, while we learn to live with a much more dangerous Donald Trump, a man whose far-right agenda threatens many of us in and out of the United States.What seems to have doomed Harris most was not so much traditional Democrats casting votes for the Republican Trump, though there was some of that. In fact, party loyalty, at around 95% for both parties, was basically the same as in 2020. Rather, Harris’s shortcomings point to the rank-and-file of the Democratic party not coming out to vote and to more first-time voters casting Republican ballots. We don’t have the final voter tally yet, but so far Harris has amassed just over 68m votes, compared with Trump’s 72m. Biden, by contrast, earned over 81m votes in 2020. By the time the final numbers are in, it’s likely that Trump will have won more than the 74m votes he had in 2020, and Harris will have been the first Democrat to lose the popular vote in 20 years.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on abuse and the Church of England: a reckoning is due for a shameful failure | Editorial,"Justin Welby didn’t do enough when told about John Smyth’s sadistic offending – and he knows itFor nearly half a century, John Smyth, who was a senior barrister and prominent evangelical Christian, sadistically abused boys and young men with impunity. At Christian summer camps in Dorset in the 1970s and 1980s, and later in Zimbabwe and South Africa, he groomed and preyed on victims whom he would beat savagely and repeatedly, leaving some of them with wounds that took weeks to heal.Smyth, who died in 2018, never faced justice for crimes committed in England. A case against him in&nbsp;Zimbabwe after the unexplained death of a 16-year-old boy, Guide Nyachuru, at one of his camps, was dismissed. But calls for the Church of England to accept&nbsp;responsibility for gross failures in regard to Smyth and the Iwerne camps, where he filled leadership roles, are finally gaining the hearing that they should have had years ago.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Trump’s tariff push: it should spark a global call for fairer trade | Editorial,"US protectionism raises alarms, underscoring the need for balanced policies as wealthy nations’ tariffs can hurt developing economies“To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff,” Donald Trump told business leaders in October. “It’s my favourite word. It needs a public relations firm.” Now, with his election victory, Mr Trump’s words&nbsp;send a shiver through global capitals. Many fear he may pull a curtain across the US economy, locking them out of the world’s largest market and cutting off access to US technology. These fears are amplified by last year’s contraction in merchandise trade – which was the first such shrinkage at a time when the global economy was growing.However, it’s wise to take Mr Trump seriously, not literally. During his last term, he imposed tariffs on more than $400bn in US-China trade and renegotiated the North American free trade agreement (Nafta) in a push to reshore blue-collar jobs. In many ways, Joe&nbsp;Biden continued – and even accelerated – these trends. Mr Trump averaged 144,000 reshored jobs a year; in 2022, Mr Biden reached 364,000.

The Guardian,Better care for mental health patients will hinge on funding | Letters,"Readers respond to the government’s proposals to reform the Mental Health Act and end injustice in the treatment of severe mental illnessI read your editorial on the proposed reforms to the Mental Health Act with interest (6 November). The act serves as the balancing point between the state’s negative duty not to interfere with individual liberty without good reason and its positive duties to prevent harm to vulnerable people and the wider public. The criteria for detention represent the threshold at which both of those duties are triggered: detention under the MHA is also a gateway to rights to proactive care and support both during and after detention. We may argue about whether the existing criteria for detention strike the right balance between the state’s positive and negative duties,&nbsp;but it is at least the same balance for&nbsp;everyone.The draft bill sets a much higher threshold for detention unless a person has committed a crime, and while this will lead to fewer people suffering the trauma and indignity of being detained, it will also mean fewer people receiving the positive support and protection of the state – that is unless they commit a crime. Even leaving aside the unexplored equalities implications of such a perverse incentive, it can surely be neither less restrictive of the individual nor more caring of the state to force people into the criminal justice system in order to receive the help they need.

The Guardian,National screening programme for prostate cancer urgently needed | Letter,"Too many men are being diagnosed late, says Oliver Kemp, especially those in high-risk groupsWes Streeting’s order to review prostate cancer screening guidance could not come at a more important time (Report, 5 November). Prostate cancer is the second-most deadly cancer among men. High-risk groups, including those with a family history and black men, are twice as likely to die from it. The existing “informed choice” system, which requires men to request testing, is failing. As a result, too many are being diagnosed late – as Chris Hoy was – which drastically reduces their chances of survival.A screening programme for high-risk groups could reverse the rise in late-stage diagnoses and deaths. We also have data to prove that, for these groups, the advantages of screening and subsequent treatment outweigh the risks of overtreatment by a factor of four. A national screening programme would move the UK from being one of the worst performers on prostate cancer in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to one of the best.

So often this season they have created chances but not been clinical. On Friday night, however, they were in the mood, producing a high-intensity first half that left Brighton shell-shocked. Beth Mead and Emily Fox combined brilliantly down the right, Katie McCabe and Caitlin Foord equally so down the left to exploit the weakness of the visitors’ full-backs and fallible defensive structure. A trademark Mead goal reminded fans of more fruitful times, a spectacular finish from Frida Maanum the same. The special moment of the night, however, belonged to Lina Hurtig. Her 76th-minute header was her first goal in 362 days, a perfect return after the Sweden winger had spent the best part of the last year on the sidelines.

There’s obvious truth in that. But it’s also true that Trump 2.0 will almost certainly not play out in line with immediate post-election predictions.We have been here before.

Typhoon Toraji, also known as Nika, is passing westwards over the island of Luzon, with winds equivalent to a category 1 hurricane. Toraji follows cyclones Trami, Kong-rey, and Yinxing, which combined left 159 people dead and more than 700,000 displaced. The ongoing recovery efforts are being frustrated by the repeated onslaughts of dangerous weather.The Philippines is no stranger to cyclones, with about 20 hitting the nation each year, but it is unusual for the same region to experience so many in such a short space of time. The main concern for authorities is the sheer amount of rainfall in recent weeks, with torrential rain from Toraji falling on to soils that are saturated and waterways that are already full. About 2,500 villages have been evacuated, mainly due to the extreme risk of landslides, while dams are carrying out controlled releases of water in an effort to counteract flood risks.

After these trials, the hugely acclaimed singer-songwriter explains why he’s turning outward to consider the world around himFor almost two decades, Phil Elverum’s life centred around performing and recording music. First as the Microphones and then as Mount Eerie, he had accumulated a catalogue of songs through which he made sense of his world, written with a diaristic honesty that won him a loyal following. But in July 2016, after the death of his wife, the cartoonist and musician Geneviève Castrée, a distraught Elverum began “rejecting my life’s work” and focused on single parenthood with their daughter, Agathe.From his home in Anacortes, Washington, Elverum reflects on those darkest days. “Geneviève and I had both been artists, obsessed with our creative lives,” he says. “That was our focus, our devotion, our identity. But when she died, I asked myself: why had drawing at a table 16 hours a day or making all these dinky little LPs been so important to us? I questioned the existential value of art and music and poetry. These had been my tools to understand life. But when Geneviève died, they felt useless to me.” Continue reading...","Mon, 11 Nov 2024 16:00:31 GMT",0.8481,-0.9224
The Guardian,Gladiator II review – Paul Mescal slays in Ridley Scott’s gobsmacking reboot,"Scott’s return to the Roman arena is something of a repeat, but it’s still a thrilling spectacle and Mescal a formidable lead. We are entertainedWhat’s Latin for “Groundhog Day”? Once upon a time, Russell Crowe’s beefy hero Maximus in Ridley Scott’s sword-and-sandal classic Gladiator was the honest soldier outside the snickering metropolitan elite, out to gain vengeance and redeem Roman honour in the blood-spattered arena, his raw courage exposing the politicians’ contemptible decadence. His defiant cry “Are you not entertained?” spoke to the showbiz-political complex of our own time and when it was alleged last year that most men thought about ancient Rome every day, the suspicion was that what they were actually thinking about was … that film.Now we are a generation along, and little has changed, in fact almost nothing. This sequel is watchable and spectacular, with the Colosseum created not digitally but as a gobsmacking 1-to-1 scale physical reconstruction with real crowds. Yet this film is weirdly almost a next-gen remake, effectively reincarnating almost every single narrative component of the original in a variant form, the events of the first film echoing in franchise eternity.

It’s amazing how three little letters can encompass something so big. From sexual identity to sexual pleasure, sex can mean so many things. But what about sexual wellness? And what does sexual wellness, in the context of menopause, even mean?Wildly open to interpretation, I’d say my sexual wellness anchors around three things: the mind (as in desire or lack of), the body (relating to both comfort and discomfort), and the soul (should I really be enjoying/pursuing sex given the broader stereotypical view when it comes to older women and sex?).

I started to feel faint and in pain and was checked by first aiders and an onsite doctor who diagnosed concussion. I felt so unwell I had to go home, missing the concert.At work the next day, I was still light-headed and in pain, and was advised by a 111 call operator to go to A&amp;E.

But she found another path and passion – and became a professional chocolatierAt 62, Jane Swayne ate a chocolate that would change her life. On a visit to see her daughter, who was working in The Hague in 2013, the Somerset-based charity worker decided to buy a box of chocolates to bring home as a present for her husband. “I found a chocolatier who made these amazing sea salt and tarragon chocolates,” she says. “I ate one and realised I hadn’t tried anything like it before. I never liked chocolate as a child but this was miraculous. I decided I had to try to recreate them when I got home – one box wouldn’t be enough.”Swayne’s husband, John, was equally enthusiastic and encouraged her. “I’ve always loved cooking but I had never tried making chocolate before,” she says. “I realised it’s a very labour-intensive process but ultimately quite simple, mainly relying on the use of fresh herbs like the tarragon.

The Guardian,Amy Poon’s recipe for golden pan-seared fish with ginger and spring onions,"A cracking weeknight supper packed with flavour and ‘mouth-fragrance’ I might be exaggerating, but to nine-year-old me it felt like 5,000 fishes. In 1982, there was a BBC1 TV show called Pebble Mill at One, which featured Glynn Christian as its pioneering TV chef, who I think paved the way for the likes of Keith Floyd and all the celebrity chefs who followed. Glynn used to cook privately for my parents’ business partners, and through this connection my brother Al got his 15 minutes of fame at the age of 13. I don’t remember the whys and wherefores; I just knew that he was going to cook on the television! I don’t know if there was a brief, but my pa decided that Al should cook a fish dish: namely golden pan-fried fish with ginger and spring onions. The Chinese characters for this dish translate literally as “fried, sealed fish”, which loses all of its poetry, but what it lacks in translation, it makes up for in flavour.My father is not a soft taskmaster, so for weeks running up to the event, he must have made Al cook this dish every night, sometimes even twice a night, until he was satisfied that he had perfected the technique. He would stand behind Al, watching critically over his shoulder. The ginger was too fine, then not fine enough. The spring onions were cut unevenly. The fish was cooked, but not golden – the heat was too low; the fish was golden but not cooked – the heat was too high. I remember the focus, the concentration, the single-mindedness of those cooking sessions, and it felt as if we were having to eat 5,000 fishes in a month.Amy Poon is the founder of the Chinese heritage food brand Poon’s London.

At McMillan Coppersmiths in Prestonpans, metal workers wield heavy wooden mallets, steel hammers and steel moulding tools called flatteners as they coax curved sheets of copper into new stills for Scotland’s malt whisky distillers.They talk about planishing, where the welds that join the seams in the rose-gold metal are hammered flat, and of tafting, where the copper is formed by their hammers into the gentle curves of the still around hefty steel moulds.Coppersmith Alphonso Martin shapes the head of the still Continue reading...","Mon, 11 Nov 2024 07:00:40 GMT",0.0,0.0258
The Guardian,A twisted tale of strange sisters: Hervé Guibert’s photographs of his reclusive great-aunts in 1970s Paris,"The late French writer and artist convinced his eccentric relatives to star in a gothic photo novel which is finally being published in English following renewed interest in his workIn 1974, Hervé Guibert, a precocious 18-year-old fledgling artist, asked his great-aunts, Suzanne and Louise, if he could make a film about them. The pair lived a life of reclusive eccentricity in a Parisian hôtel particulier (grand urban house) in the 15th arrondissement alongside a pampered German shepherd guard dog called Whysky. Though Guibert was one of their very few regular visitors, they dismissed his suggestion outright. Undaunted, he wrote a play based on their life – it was never produced – and took hundreds of photographs of them, mostly from across the table at their regular lunches.“Everything began to take off when I began to print some photos just to see, to show them,” he recalls in a passage from Suzanne and Louise, a roman-photo (photo novel) that first appeared in a French edition in 1980 and is about to be published for the first time in English. Surprised and flattered by what they saw, the sisters agreed to be the subjects of a more ambitious project in which Guibert required them to pose more formally and even act out vignettes that reflected their intertwined lives.

The Guardian,The big picture: Marvin E Newman’s Californian dreamers,"A retrospective of the work of the prolific US street photographer reveals a singular gift for investing everyday moments with lasting dramaMarvin E Newman, the son of a family of bakers from the Bronx, New York, had dreams of being a painter or a sculptor. After hitchhiking to art school in Chicago after the second world war he found a different way to express that ambition: he became a celebrated photographer during the golden age of American magazines, among the first to understand the possibilities of colour for publications that included Sports Illustrated and Esquire.This study of women working at a drive-thru corn dog stand on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles was part of a series about California commissioned by Time/Life in 1966. The image, included in a new retrospective collection of Newman’s vast canon of work, is a classic example of his gift for framing American street life: witness the palm tree reflection that creates a Statue of Liberty crown around the head of the woman on the right – itself cast against the skyline of the Hollywood hills. Newman’s California pictures seem to demand a caption from Joan Didion’s great essay on the state, also published in 1966, “Some Dreamers of the Golden Dream”: “Here,” wrote Didion, “is the last stop for all those … who drifted away from … the old ways… they are trying to find a new life style, trying to find it in the only places they know to look: the movies and the newspapers.” Continue reading...","Sun, 10 Nov 2024 07:00:11 GMT",0.0,0.9349
