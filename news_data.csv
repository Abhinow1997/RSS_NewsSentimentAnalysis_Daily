We may not immediately know the answer, but we know it when we (don’t) see it.

It would be nice if they seemed a bit more normal while they did it.The good news is, they can get better at it – just ask Keir Starmer. This week it was confirmed that the prime minister worked with a vocal coach, Leonie Mellinger, for five years before entering Downing Street to soften his buttoned-up barrister’s monotone. Indeed, in a testimonial on her website, Starmer says Mellinger’s help “made all of this possible”. Quite the vote of confidence – some of us thought it was the voters.

Why we can’t stand feeling bored,"In one study, nearly half of participants left alone for 15 minutes with no stimulation chose to have an electric shockPeople hate feeling bored. We hate it so much that we spend hours mindlessly scrolling through our phones. Many of us would rather experience physical discomfort than sit quietly with our own thoughts, as a 2014 University of Virginia study found. Nearly half of participants sitting alone in a room for 15 minutes, with no stimulation other than a button that would administer a mild electric shock, pressed the button.On the other hand, we also romanticize boredom.

He talks trust and his greatest roles – while his PR team try to ban any questions about TrumpArt mirrors life on the Netflix show Zero Day, a tense political thriller for Donald Trump’s second term. There are mobs on the street and far-right trolls on TV. There’s a billionaire making mischief and a state of uproar in Congress. Robert De Niro stars as ex-president George Mullen, whisked out of retirement to investigate a crippling cyberattack. Mullen is dogged and courageous, but he’s a man of the past, not quite on his mettle. His daughter thinks he’s out of touch. “The world has changed in ways he doesn’t understand,” says his wife.I’m excited to talk to De Niro about Zero Day and its real-world echoes. The show’s politics are what drew him to the project. The actor has made no secret of his disgust and loathing for Trump. But our Zoom interview comes with constraints.

The bed behind her is unmade, she confesses, and there’s “a bunch of marbles and blocks on the floor” left by her sons, now seven and three. But on Zoom she has blurred her background so none of this is visible on screen, just as here, on the other side of the Atlantic, I’ve angled my laptop camera away from the mess on my kitchen worktop. We’ve both automatically hidden the domestic for the sake of looking professional, ironically given this interview is about making unseen, unpaid labour in the home visible.Callaci, a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, has written a book, Wages for Housework, which chronicles the radical 1970s feminist campaign that argued for recognition of the economic value of domestic labour. In truth, she explains, it was a recipe for revolution, designed to smash capitalism and its underpinning myth that women just love keeping house so much they’ll do it for nothing.

It plays a large part of every Test week and it’s fantastic because it creates debate, it gets people talking.It is not specific to England either but the problem with Steve Borthwick’s recent team selections is that I just wish it felt like it was coming from a place of understanding exactly what his best team is and precisely how to deliver their best gameplan.

Who he? In his inaugural address, Trump pledged to restore the name Mount McKinley to North America’s highest peak. It was an anti-woke dig at Barack Obama, who had given it the Alaskan native name of Denali. But why this idolatry?The answer has since become clear. McKinley was the president (1897-1901) who introduced super-tariffs in his first year in office to protect the US’s post-recessionary manufacturers. Some were as high as 57%, and were seen as an alternative fundraiser to income tax. McKinley was also appealing to Trump for presiding over the founding of a hesitant US empire beyond the North American continent, one from which it has since retreated. Apart from that, the man was unostentatious, intelligent and impeccably polite, faults that Trump is clearly ready to forgive.

The Guardian,I haven’t banned screen time for my kids – I’ve introduced binge-watching instead | Emma Brockes,"Research shows that not all hours spent glued to a screen are created equal, so I’m actively encouraging nutritional content such as Young SheldonI’m not particularly into banning things in my house, partly out of laziness – enforcement creates conflict, or at least a need for me to get up and do something – and partly out of a dim conviction that the more rule-bound the child, the greater the meltdowns. The kid not allowed snacks between meals goes mad at houses with an open-fridge policy. Inflexible bedtimes create inflexible children. News blackouts designed to preserve the innocence of a child can make the world seem more not less frightening, and so on.The obvious exception to all this is tech, which takes away all of our abilities to self-regulate. Until recently, I imagined there was no amount of slack-jawed screen time that would exhaust my children’s appetite for it. This has turned out to be wrong: one child, off sick a few weeks ago, actually looked up bleary-eyed from her iPad after two days of constant usage and expressed a desire to go back to school. More generally, however, they will want more time on it than I think healthy, even as I use the time bought by their screen addiction to feed my own.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Fri, 07 Feb 2025 10:38:45 GMT",-0.4588,0.863

Just a few days ago it was the fifth anniversary of the UK leaving the EU, so how come we didn’t have a weekend of celebrations? The Labour government marked the occasion by choosing to ignore it entirely. As if it had never happened. The Tories were also rather muted, with Kemi Badenoch keeping a low profile. Even Nigel Farage was sotto voce. His statement merely noted that Brexit would have gone a great deal better if the Tories had managed it better.

Young, single people like me were only socialising online with existing friends, and opportunities to make fresh connections were rare.When I met Irenka from Poland at a literary festival, she looked as thirsty for new friends as I was. As we started complaining about the difficulties of mingling she introduced me to an app that allows people to find new pals on organised walks. I quickly downloaded it.

And, in so doing, showing their colleagues how to overcome their reputation for ditheringIt’s easy to be disgusted with the Democratic party right now. Donald Trump is running roughshod over the rule of law, treating the US constitution like toilet paper. His trusty pal Elon Musk is the arsonist in chief, burning down worthy democratic institutions and installing his minions in the heart of government where they have gained access to citizens’ private information. Much of what’s happening is illegal and unconstitutional.And the Democrats, mostly, look less like an opposition party and more like stunned bystanders.

His last administration slapped sanctions on it over its investigations into potential war crimes in Afghanistan, including by the US, and into the actions of Israeli forces. But his new executive order goes even further, attacking the fundamentals of the court and endangering its&nbsp;functioning.The US never joined the ICC, fearing scrutiny of its own actions and those of its allies. Joe Biden damaged both the court and US claims of commitment to the “rules-based international order” when he justified the arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin while attacking as “outrageous” the one issued for Benjamin Netanyahu.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on romantasy fiction: dragons storm the bookshops | Editorial,"Hit novels by Sarah J Maas and Rebecca Yarros offer more than sex and escapism. They have reclaimed the fantasy genre for womenA strange and powerful creature has taken over the publishing industry – romantasy, a magical union of romance and fantasy. Last week in scenes reminiscent of Pottermania 20 years ago, bookshops across the country held midnight launches, with fans dressed as their favourite characters, for the publication of Onyx Storm, the third instalment of Rebecca Yarros’s Empyrean series. In its first week it became the fastest-selling adult title since records began, with more than 180,000 copies sold in one day in the UK alone.Yarros is following in the fairy dust of fellow American novelist Sarah J Maas, who is credited with spearheading the genre with her hugely successful A&nbsp;Court of Thorns and Roses series. In just five years, a genre born during the pandemic and rising on a blaze of BookTok recommendations and emojis has gone from being a niche offshoot of young adult fiction to a once-in-a-generation phenomenon. In the past year, the market share of science fiction and fantasy books rose by over 41%. With their action-packed storylines, alternate worlds and friendship groups, romantasy novels satisfy a nostalgia for those who grew up on a diet of the Harry Potter, The Hunger Games and Twilight series. Tolkein this is not, nor JK Rowling. But lack of literary finesse never hindered juggernaut bestsellers from the likes of Dan Brown (who has a new Robert Langdon novel out in September).

The Guardian,"AI is developing fast, but regulators must be faster | Letters","Dr Tom McClelland on the consequences of AI consciousness, Michael Webb on protecting creative industries, and Prof Virginia Dignum and Prof Wendy Hall on the need for a global regulatory frameworkThe recent open letter regarding AI consciousness on which you report (AI systems could be ‘caused to suffer’ if consciousness achieved, says research, 3 February) highlights a genuine moral problem: if we create conscious AI (whether deliberately or inadvertently) then we would have a duty not to cause it to suffer. What the letter fails to do, however, is to capture what a big “if” this is.Some promising theories of consciousness do indeed open the door to AI consciousness. But other equally promising theories suggest that being conscious requires being an organism. Although we can look for indicators of consciousness in AI, it is very difficult – perhaps impossible – to&nbsp;know whether an AI is actually conscious or merely presenting the outward signs of consciousness. Given how deep these problems run, the only reasonable stance to take on artificial consciousness is&nbsp;an&nbsp;agnostic one. Continue reading...","Fri, 07 Feb 2025 18:01:26 GMT",0.0,-0.653
The Guardian,We need to keep an open mind on cold fusion potential | Letters,"Scientists around the world are leading research into cold fusion as an alternative to fossil fuels so it should not be dismissed as pseudo-scientific, say MIT-based researchers. Plus a letter from Huw PriceRecently, the letters pages of the Guardian have featured conflicting accounts of cold fusion, otherwise known as low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR). On the one hand, the Nobel laureate Prof Brian Josephson and his co-authors argue (27 January) that cold fusion’s time has come: companies can “make these reactions work quite reliably”, with the promise of “ending reliance on fossil fuels”. In response, Dr Philip Thomas, a researcher at the University of Exeter, proclaims (2 February) that cold fusion is a “pseudo-scientific fringe theory” in violation of the “laws of nature”. Which laws, in particular, Dr Thomas does not say.There is, however, a constructive middle ground between Josephson’s fervour and Thomas’s denigration. LENR advocates often fail to appreciate the evidentiary standard required to demonstrate novel nuclear effects. Overzealous critics are generally not well read on the LENR literature and lack perspective on the emergence of new fields from anomalous effects in science. As a result, they contribute to the palpable stigma that the Cambridge emeritus professor Huw Price calls the “reputation trap”. Regardless, there is compelling experimental data and strong theoretical motivations to study cold fusion. Continue reading...","Fri, 07 Feb 2025 18:01:16 GMT",0.0,-0.0961

The Guardian,Ballet superstar Carlos Acosta: ‘Dance was salvation. My life depended on it’,"Ballet has always been more than just a job for Carlos Acosta. And as director of Birmingham Royal Ballet, he is trying to make it bigger than ever – even in the face of brutal cuts and the tragic death of its CEO“Gone are the times when you used to just create for your own indulgence,” says Carlos Acosta. Now, when it comes to running a major ballet company, and keeping it afloat, “You have to learn from your audience.”
 Acosta has always been a crowd-pleaser, ever since he took the top prize at the famous Prix de Lausanne competition in 1990, the auditorium erupting in cheers at the then 16-year-old Cuban’s Don Quixote solo. He went on to fire up adoring audiences around the world, settling at London’s Royal Ballet for 17 years, but making global guest appearances as one of the few genuine ballet superstars.
 He’s talking to me from a very unstarry grey office in Birmingham. But even the unflattering rectangle of&nbsp;a video call can’t dampen his crinkle-eyed smile, and down-to-earth magnetism. He’s been running Birmingham Royal Ballet (BRB) for exactly five years, and just renewed his contract, so despite all his other projects (the Acosta Danza company in&nbsp;Havana and Acosta Dance Centre in&nbsp;Woolwich, south London, among them) he’s committed to the precarious business of helping ballet thrive in the Midlands. More precarious since Birmingham City Council announced it was slashing its arts budget entirely, hence the concern with a healthy box office as well as artistic integrity.But that needn’t always mean playing it safe. Acosta has made it his&nbsp;business to make bold artistic choices, commissioning surprising new works and choreographers, and making headlines with the collision of&nbsp;heavy metal and pointe shoes that was Black Sabbath: The Ballet, which tours to the US this summer and has just announced another UK tour in 2026. He pushes his dancers to be crowdpleasers, too. “From day one I&nbsp;said: ‘This has to be a company of virtuosos,’” he says, looking for the kind of fireworks that make classical ballet a mainstream entertainment in&nbsp;his home country. “I want personalities, ‘Look at me!’ – that’s how&nbsp;I like it. I want dancers that are exceptional, and I think we are getting there.” He’s right that there is great talent in the company, although I’m sad they’ve lost the beautiful Eric Pinto Cata to Paris Opera Ballet.

Quick to write and cheap to make, films like I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, Cherry Falls and Valentine trotted out slightly different variations on the same formula (masked killer, WB channel teens) until the films became dumber than the ones Scream had been targeting in the first place.It tracks then that after a Ghostface reboot, with 2022’s surprisingly successful fifth instalment, the same would happen once again. Heart Eyes, a film that boasts the same production company and one of its stars, is exactly what an exec would give an easy greenlight to, an easily sellable “if you liked” knock-off. But whatever might have made sense on paper just doesn’t translate to screen, a fun little concept that ends up being something of a drag.

The Guardian,The best Valentine’s Day gifts: 34 thoughtful ideas they’ll actually want,"Forget hot-housed roses and generic chocolates: from a modern mix tape to a padel racket, give them something more considered this yearNot everyone embraces Valentine’s Day. It is, at worst, a commercial free-for-all crammed with out-of-season roses and overpriced, throwaway gifts and, at best, a day that sees you dashing to a supermarket at 6pm trying to find something that doesn’t scream “after-thought”.But if you are going to embrace it, there are some great, thoughtful gifts out there. We’ve put together a list of more unusual, long-lasting ideas: from Lego flowers to a digital mix tape, a refurbished games console to an affordable fragrance. Whether you’re looking for a present to bring you closer as a couple – half-and-half duvet, anyone? – or to attract someone new, our guide will help you ace Valentine’s Day this year.

But they’re right. The older I get, the more I know it. When I was 20, I could sleep anywhere: a friend’s floor, a filthy sofa – even a phone box one night. These days I won’t get a single one of 40 winks if I’m not lying on a decent mattress. Comfy but firm, cosy but breathable, and with loads of cool spots for my feet.Today’s best mattresses promise all this and more. Gone are the days when your biggest decision was between a sprung double or a sprung king size. Pocket springs are still around, but they face stiff – well, medium firm – competition from hybrid mattresses that combine springs and memory foam to provide that all-important balance of comfort and support.Best overall mattress:

Lighter on the waistline and wallet and hangxiety-free, low ABV (alcohol by volume) drinks have surged in popularity in recent years.

The Guardian,‘It’s not whether you do it – it’s how you do it’: the expert guide to healthy gossiping,"Talking about others has a bad reputation – but it can also be a social glue that helps create bonds. This is how to harness its power for goodIt’s safe to say Pope Francis is not a fan of gossip. Just before Christmas, in one of his final public appearances of 2024, he declared it “an evil that destroys social life, sickens people’s hearts and leads to nothing … gossip is zero”. Beyond the Vatican, however, gossip’s bad reputation is being reassessed. Last year a study in the US found that gossip evolved to help social groups function, by spreading useful information about individual members and encouraging cooperation. Researchers also found that people spend approximately an hour every day gossiping – and that “almost everyone” does it.Far from it being the preserve of “small minds”, as the (annoying) adage goes, it seems that gossip is a natural social behaviour, with potential benefits. There are, however, good and bad ways of going about it. We asked experts about how to gossip smarter. Continue reading...","Fri, 07 Feb 2025 15:00:05 GMT",0.0258,-0.4966

It followed a memoir and a biopic, which cemented the Elton lore: how in 1967 jobbing musician Reg Dwight was given an envelope of Bernie Taupin’s lyrics, forging the greatest songwriting partnership since Lennon and McCartney, a baroque new identity, a rampant hit rate of era-defining albums and the commensurate cocaine addiction. Then came sobriety, an emphatic commitment to funding HIV and Aids treatment, finding love with David Furnish; The Lion King, Candle in the Wind, one of the UK’s first gay marriages, two sons. Last year, the documentary Never Too Late told his story again. Just last month, his greatest hits collection, Diamonds, finally hit UK No 1 after 374 weeks.

Stuart Heritage and Rudi Zygadlo explainOnce, Stuart Heritage’s head was covered in thick, golden, shiny hair. But then, when he was in his early 20s, he noticed a small patch of scalp showing through. At first he tried a hair regrowth treatment, but it didn’t make much difference. As this patch grew, he began brushing his hair over the bald area. Before he knew it, he says, he was horrified to find he was sporting a combover. “Going bald is horrible,” he says ruefully.Once you have accepted this loss, however, and that it means you are ageing, actually “being bald is fine”. And not just fine – commonplace. He tells Helen Pidd that about 55% of Caucasian men aged over 75 will have experienced some hair loss. Which is why bald heads used to be ubiquitous in popular culture. There were bald footballers, bald movie stars and bald prime ministers. Yet today they seem to be fading from view.
