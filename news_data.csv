A surprise offensive launched by Syrian rebels from the north west of the country last week has reignited a dormant conflict – and revealed a change in the balance of power caused not by one but two nearby wars, in Ukraine and Lebanon and the Middle East.Aleppo was the scene of fierce and destructive fighting between 2012 and 2016 when the Syrian civil war was at its height.

The Guardian,Emma review – a Regency comedy as light as a pillow fight,"Abbey theatre, DublinSet in a nonspecific Austenland inspired more by Hollywood than history, this is an energetic, puppyish production that is easy to likeHandsome, clever and rich Emma Woodhouse finds new ways to exercise her charm in Kate Hamill’s adaptation of Jane Austen’s novel from 1816. Claire O’Reilly’s pop-powered production ramps up the arch comedy and artifice in a fluorescent, Regency-lite setting, which exists somewhere in an Austenland informed by screen adaptations from Clueless to Netflix’s Persuasion, with a hint of classical Hollywood romcoms in set designer Molly O’Cathain’s sweeping stairs. What is retained from Austen’s social satire is the wealthy, leisured milieu of the characters.Indulged by her widowed father, the hyperactive Emma (Toni O’Rourke) fills her days by manipulating the relationships of people around her. Fancying herself a matchmaker, she takes gawky teenager Harriet (Hannah Mamalis) under her wing, persuading her that the unctuous vicar Mr Elton (Domhnall Herdman) would be a brilliant catch. Mamalis brings puppyish energy to her absurdly gauche character, gulping down the biscuits that Emma throws at her in reward for her devotion.

The Guardian,The brain microbiome: could understanding it help prevent dementia?,"Long thought to be sterile, our brains are now believed to harbour all sorts of micro-organisms, from bacteria to fungi. How big a part do they play in Alzheimer’s and similar diseases?Nine years ago, Nikki Schultek, an active and healthy woman in her early 30s, experienced a sudden cascade of debilitating and agonising symptoms – including cognitive and breathing problems and heart arrhythmia – and was investigated for multiple sclerosis. But three brain scans and numerous X-rays later, there was still no diagnosis or treatment plan. “It was like living in a nightmare, imagining not watching my children – three and five years old – grow up,” says Schultek.Now, speaking on a video call from North Carolina, she is as bright as a button and shows no signs of degenerative brain disease. It turned out she had multiple chronic infections, including Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria, which causes Lyme disease and which had stealthily reached her brain. Antibiotics restored her health, but B burgdorferi is hard to eradicate once in the brain. She may need maintenance treatment to keep the disease at bay.

The Guardian,Every Valley: The Story of Handel’s Messiah review – hallelujah! A fresh take on the composer’s much-loved work,"By revealing the murky circumstances in which it was created, Charles King’s fascinating history of the oratorio shows it in a new lightI love the amorous mayhem of Handel’s operas, but have always had my doubts about his oratorios, especially the Messiah. First there’s the bossy compulsion to stand during the “Hallelujah” chorus, just because a spurious tradition says that King George II did so in 1743; once hoisted upright, you have to fidget through endless awkwardly mis-accentuated iterations of “for ever and ever”. I’m also puzzled by the quirks of the biblical text, which are underlined by musical repetition. The soprano rhapsodises like a fetishist about the “beautiful feet” of those who preach the gospel, and the tenor prophesies that “every valley shall be exalted” by the saviour: will salvation really reflate those sagging hollows in the landscape?But after reading Charles King’s Every Valley: The Story of Handel’s Messiah, I have been converted. King doesn’t exactly explicate the phrase he takes for his title, but he points out that Martin Luther King often quoted it in his orations about civil rights, so I probably shouldn’t quibble. More importantly, his book humanises the work’s exalted creators and demonstrates that the Messiah is not a pompous manifesto of faith but a troubled, often desperate quest for consolation. Despite those hectoring hallelujahs, what moves King is the oratorio’s prescription for overcoming personal misery. Continue reading...","Sun, 01 Dec 2024 17:00:00 GMT",0.7644,0.429

Born in Albany, New York, Gossett received her diagnosis in 1918 when diabetes had no known treatment. Tragically, her life expectancy was just a matter of months. Her parents desperately searched for any way to keep their daughter alive. A New Jersey physician had developed a radical course of action: keeping the blood sugar levels of diabetic children low by feeding them the bare minimum needed to survive. This could see a prognosis of months extended to years. These young patients weren’t exactly living, but they were alive.In the spring of 1919, Gossett went into this starvation clinic. She’d have been constantly cold and hungry. Emaciated, unable to move or grow. At its lowest, her weight dropped to 20kg. Three years later, Gossett was lingering on death’s threshold but, crucially, hadn’t crossed to the other side. Continue reading...","Sun, 01 Dec 2024 14:00:13 GMT",0.0,-0.0258

As the senior manager of the Woodside Animal Welfare Trust in Plymouth, she is tasked with not only herding cats, but accommodating them, too, and this autumn, she says, the shelter is rapidly approaching breaking point. “It just feels as if it’s been nonstop,” she says. Long after the supposed end of kitten season, the shelter is still receiving a steady stream of newborns, along with pregnant cats.Out in the community, at the Plymouth dockyards and elsewhere, large colonies of feral cats have sprung up, and are multiplying exponentially.

The Guardian,‘I’m a mixed Black female historical re-enactor in a sea of men with beards’,"Not everyone would want to spend their weekends dressed in a tunic fighting medieval battles, but my love of re-enacting is rooted in keeping history aliveIt is the summer of 1265. I am bottling leeches in an open-air apothecary as a medical apprentice of the church. Minstrels tune their musical instruments and soldiers sharpen their swords. Gloucester has just been captured by Prince Edward, and royal forces are growing in the west of England. The men come to me for yarrow to staunch their bleeding, comfrey to heal their injuries, and sulphur to soothe their sores. I smile at their faith in vinegar, a woman’s touch and prayer. But secretly I long to be a lowly foot soldier, fighting with the men in the mud.Eventually, I summon the courage to pick up an axe and infiltrate their ranks. My presence on the battlefield is not as unlikely as it might sound. Some of us, such as Margaret of Beverley, fought. Only a little cross-dressing is required. I swap my ankle-length kirtle for a tunic, the wimple on my hair for a coif and helmet, and wrap my legs in woollen hose over large linen trousers. A knife hangs at my side. My femininity is hidden beneath a heavy protective gambeson or tunic. Its stitches are grubby and grey, as if the garment itself is sewn together with gristle. The thick padding absorbs the shock of a weapon, though sometimes a blade still slips through. At this point I drop my axe, clutch my chest and groan. The crowds, delighted by the spectacle of death, begin to cheer. Continue reading...","Sun, 01 Dec 2024 10:00:03 GMT",0.0,-0.2732
The Guardian,Labour’s big relaunch won’t solve its biggest problem: this government doesn’t speak human | John Harris,"Farage and Trump are winning because they understand the politics of emotion, while Labour is lost in numbers and statisticsKeir Starmer’s people don’t like the word “relaunch”, but that’s what it is. On Thursday, the prime minister will give a set-piece speech about a “Plan for Change” that really should have materialised back in July. It will seemingly be based on “tangible outcomes” and the insistence that the government machine is newly focused on issues such as early years education and NHS waiting lists, briefed to the media in a blizzard of official statistics. What has triggered all this is not exactly mysterious: amid dire approval ratings and a general sense of malaise and mishap – the latest hiccup is the somewhat farcical departure of the transport secretary, Louise Haigh – his administration is palpably unpopular.The truth, of course, is that the prime minister and his colleagues hardly attracted much acclaim and affection in the first place. In July, only one in five of the electorate voted Labour. Our electoral system might maintain the appearance of politics-as-usual, but a lot of us know what is really afoot: the UK’s increasing resemblance to any number of European countries, with two supposedly main parties competing for a declining share of the vote, while everything fragments and hard-right populists seize on people’s continuing resentments. As evidenced by Starmer’s recent acknowledgment that “very many people didn’t vote Labour at the last election”, the tension between his government’s parliamentary majority and its dearth of support in the real world remains its defining feature.

The Guardian,Ideas and originality are overrated – just ask Titian or Michelangelo | Nell Frizzell,"Stop telling yourself you have to create something unique, and perhaps you will free yourself to make something goodLast week, I interviewed the journalist, podcaster and author Hattie Crisell about her new book, In Writing. It’s a collection of writing advice and insight from the many people she has interviewed over the years for her podcast, from the sublime (Jon Ronson constantly running out mid-sentence to save baby snapping turtles trying to cross the road to his garden), to the more worrying (Will Storr’s “dark hole” of a study in which he has a blackout curtain closed and even a sticker over his desk lamp so it only glows as faintly as possible for the entirety of the writing day). But the words that struck me most came from the comic book writer and illustrator Tor Freeman, who said: “I’m not going to write an original story, ever.” This was coupled with the journalist and novelist John Lanchester’s comment: “I find it hard to explain the extent to which the idea is not the main thing.”So there you have it. Ideas and originality are overrated. Hooray! As overrated as brunch, speaking Latin, pore strips, pugs, Formula One, mineral water, striped wallpaper, live music and expensive moisturisers. (That list is mine by the way – maybe even a wholly original thought.) As someone who has written four books and about 174 fortnightly columns, all tangentially connected to questions of pregnancy and parenting, I am of course relieved and delighted at the news that sometimes the idea that doesn’t leave you is better than the idea nobody else has ever had.

The only problem is they would stay up there indefinitely if so much as a shih-tzu started snuffling at the base. The fact that my kids are scared of the many dogs we encounter when we play outdoors is a small pain. But it raises interesting questions about who has priority in a public space – a dog or a child?This debate has suddenly gone into overdrive in Tower Hamlets, east London, where we live. A consultation by the local council about imposing stricter controls on dog owners has sparked a visible rise in pro-dog activism over the past few weeks.Oliver Keens is a writer, author and columnist, as well as a DJDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Another election? Mr Caine is taking the Michael | David Mitchell,"Yes Labour have been taxier and spendier than their manifesto implied, but actors signing an Elon Musk-supported petition is a sinister stepThis week I was all geared up to slag off Rachel Reeves and now, thanks to Michael Caine, I can’t. I hope you’re happy, Michael. Is that what you wanted? To close down any centrist criticism of the government? Because that’s what you’ve done.Let me explain. Michael Caine, a great film star and an astute, relatable and popular public figure, has expressed his support for that petition for another general election. You know, the one that was set up a week or so ago by a pub owner from the Midlands and then got bigged up by Elon Musk. It accuses the government of having gone back on promises it made during the election campaign and, at the time of writing, it’s got 2.8m signatures, one of them, presumably, Michael Caine’s.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on a race for missile supremacy: competition fuels a dangerous escalation | Editorial,"The INF treaty kept nuclear missiles off European soil and was a brake on a perilous arms buildup. Now it is goneFive years ago, the collapse of a landmark cold war arms treaty opened a Pandora’s box, unleashing missile-shaped furies that have struck Ukraine. The 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty ended when the US withdrew, citing Russian violations&nbsp;dating back to 2014 under Vladimir Putin. While abandoning the treaty aligned with the first Trump administration’s broader opposition to arms control, continuing to pressure Mr Putin into compliance would have been the wiser course.Targeting Kyiv’s forces are the hypersonic Oreshnik missile and the ballistic Iskander missile. Both can carry a nuclear warhead and would have been barred under the INF treaty. These weapons signal an alarming return to cold war-style tit-for‑tat posturing, with great powers ramping up their military&nbsp;capabilities. Their use highlights Moscow’s accelerated missile development. But it also raises questions about the implications of a nuclear-tipped Oreshnik missile – capable of striking European capitals within 12 to 16 minutes – for Nato security.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Italy’s divided opposition: a Five Star revolution can help unite the left | Editorial,"Turmoil in the populist party founded by comedian Beppe Grillo could herald a crucial progressive realignmentPolitical scientists have long argued that a defining characteristic of populism is the distinction between a “pure people” and a “corrupt elite”. In the turbulent politics of the early 21st century, few public figures have promoted that worldview with as much vigour and impact as the Italian comedian Beppe Grillo.During the 2010s, Mr Grillo’s Five Star Movement (M5S) became at one point the most successful and quixotic populist party in Europe, coming first in the Italian election of 2018 by a comfortable margin. Its signature principles were a belief in the power of direct&nbsp;democracy, and a conviction that traditional left‑right politics should be superseded by a popular revolt against la casta – the privileged elite whose power persisted whichever government was in charge. People power was mobilised through the party’s Rousseau platform, designed as a forum for online democracy by M5S’s co-founder and internet evangelist Gianroberto Casaleggio.

The Guardian,Let’s summon the courage for UN reform | Letters,"The west cannot in good conscience continue to press for democracy when it denies it at the core of the global system, writes Simon PrentisOmar Barghouti quite is right to highlight the dysfunctional nature of the UN (The UN has failed us on Gaza. We need to decolonize and radically reform it, 25 November). Indeed, as currently constituted it cannot be otherwise, given the glaring conceptual contradiction at its very heart: the democratic nature of the general assembly is fatally vitiated by the veto system at the security council. For a veto (Latin for “I forbid”) is the classic tool of tyrants, and at the UN it allows any of its five permanent members – the heirs of the victorious allies of the second world war – to unilaterally suppress any democratic decision that goes against what they consider to be their interests.And, for the most part, these interests remain those of a world that is the product of another age – the age of empire. That was the price of the UN’s formation – a US delegate at the 1945 San Francisco conference dramatically tore up a copy of the draft charter to emphasise that without agreement on the veto, there would be no UN. But we no longer live in that world – or at least, not in a world where such interests are still seen as the natural spoils of victory.

The Guardian,Film advent calendar: 24 festive movies chosen by leading film figures,"​Count down to Christmas with favourites selected by Sean Baker, Gillian Anderson, John Waters, Mike Leigh, Gurinder Chadha, Will Sharpe and moreThe Christmas movie has, in recent years, become its own industrial complex, algorithmically churned out by streaming services to hit various subscriber demographic sweet spots. Perhaps the seemingly disposable likes of Hot Frosty and Meet Me Next Christmas will be treasured for many Decembers to come, but they have a tough canon to crack, as represented by our all-star Advent calendar of festive movie favourites, chosen by some of the film industry’s best and brightest, invited by the Observer New Review to help our readers count down to the big day itself.
 Some of the films here are as firmly entrenched in the season as mince pies and fir trees – who can argue with director Gurinder Chadha’s selection of It’s a Wonderful Life or actor Joe Alwyn’s of The Snowman? Others are less obvious: you wouldn’t expect John Waters, Hollywood’s emperor of bad taste, to go cosy and cute, and sure enough, his choice of the notorious video nasty Christmas Evil would make many a person bring up their turkey dinner. For a lot of us, meanwhile, our personal Christmas classics aren’t technically Christmas films at all, but made so by timing and association: we’re steering clear of the played-out Die Hard debate, but Himesh Patel certainly isn’t alone in finding the holiday incomplete without the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and screenwriter David Nicholls makes a strong case for Phantom Thread as festive viewing. To each their own Christmas, and to all a good night. Continue reading...","Sun, 01 Dec 2024 08:00:05 GMT",0.4588,0.9901

The Guardian,Hawking Building review – the Science Museum’s giant new shed of the weird and wonderful,"Science and Innovation Park, Wroughton, SwindonOn an old RAF airfield, a no-frills metal barn has been built to house the reserve collections of the London museum and its associates, with 300,000 objects ranging from a 1960s nuclear missile to Stephen Hawking’s voice synthesiserMuseum storage facilities are unseen wonders, dark troves of material in little-publicised locations. They might hold 95% or more of an institution’s collections, with some objects as fascinating and beautiful as those on view, others acquired for long-forgotten reasons, destined to languish on obscure shelves. They offer resources for researchers, content for exhibitions, and refreshed permanent displays and refuge to artefacts with nowhere much else to go. They are necessary backup to the workings of a museum. They are the underwater part of the iceberg, the paddling parts of a swan, the dark side of the moon.Now, three of the country’s most significant reserve collections are being rehoused in new multimillion-pound facilities where, as well as being better cared for, they will be more accessible to the public. This shift has been prompted by a government plan, announced in 2015, to sell Blythe House in west London, an Edwardian baroque office block converted in the 1970s into a store for the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert and the Science Museum. The first of these has moved its objects to a new archaeological research collection in Shinfield, near Reading, and the second to the V&amp;A East Storehouse, a “new kind of museum experience”, which will open next year within the former 2012 Olympics media centre in east London.

As part of a partnership with Adobe Express, the quick and easy content app, he’s now on a mission to show people how to turn their vision into actionable steps with the help of a carefully-conceived manifesto that aligns with their goals and values. Calling it the “Manifest-o Method”, the idea is to provide a framework that can help guide entrepreneurs in their early stages. As he put it in an interview with Adobe: “Manifestation without action is like setting your car’s sat-nav without turning the engine on.”When creating the Manifest-o Method, Bartlett, who is probably best known for The Diary of a CEO podcast and his appearances on BBC Dragons’ Den, drew on his own experience of creating and designing a business manifesto for his podcast company, Flight Studio, using Adobe Express.

The Guardian,‘The best personal brands aren’t overly curated’: six dos and don’ts for the jobs market,"Personal branding is far more complex than it once was, with evolving tech adding to the possibilitiesPersonal branding has undergone a radical rebranding. The way we showcase ourselves in the workplace and jobs market has been transformed by the tools at our disposal and societal shifts, such as the melding of work and life. Twenty-five years ago, you had a CV and, if you wanted a new job, you updated it and sent it to prospective employers. Your reputation may have enhanced your prospects but, when it came to job hunting, your qualifications and CV were pretty much the only showcase you had.With the internet everything changed – and then changed again with social media and smartphones. Suddenly, you were visible to millions of people on a device they carried around in their pockets. Those same tools gave you the ability to step up from CVs to slickly presented websites and slide decks. And social media gave everyone a platform to build and manage their own personal brand in real time. Continue reading...","Fri, 01 Nov 2024 13:59:22 GMT",0.6369,0.8338
The Guardian,Is it important for kids to learn about winning and losing?,"Some experts say the values of fun and personal development in youth sports are being replaced by performance and victoryMy boyfriend’s parents coached youth sports teams in the 90s, so they have many anecdotes about how children handle winning and losing. Two cousins on separate soccer teams were so competitive that the one who lost would refuse the post-game high-five, instead retreating to some nearby bushes to cry. A little girl used to kick opponents with her ice skates during hockey; another refused to pass because her dad gave her cash for every goal she scored. One boy, when his team lost, lay flat out on the ice and simply wouldn’t get up.There’s a general consensus that, in addition to boosting fitness, youth sports impart valuable life skills, like teamwork and discipline. Winning and losing are especially significant, because they prepare children for the setbacks and challenges they will face in adult life.

The Guardian,‘I felt like a bystander in my own internal recovery’: one woman’s battle for health after a life-changing diagnosis,"Facing an enormous decision about her health filled Kat Lister with wonder at her body’s ability to fight for herThe 2cm wound to the right of my bellybutton had been oozing for days. A syrupy weep in the well of my abdomen. A surgical pothole so small that it felt almost indulgent to photograph it in my bathroom mirror. As if these tiny keyhole incisions dotted around my swollen stomach – one, two, three, four, five of them – bore no relation to the magnitude of the plunder beneath.Magnitude. Or, should I say: weight. “Do you feel lighter?” a friend asked me a week after I had a total colectomy to save my life. To which I replied (somewhat contradictorily): yes and no. It didn’t take long for my doctors to start referring to my large bowel, laden with more than 400 precancerous polyps, as a “heavy burden” – and I think there is something poetic in that choice of words. A flash of humanity in an otherwise sterile place. Which is where I found myself in May last year, staring numbly at pictures of stoma bags in St Mark’s hospital in north-west London, the only hospital in the world to specialise entirely in intestinal and colorectal medicine.

The Guardian,Cold comfort: watercolours of Paris in winter – in pictures,"After falling in love with Paris’s art, architecture and style, David Coggins and his family have been heading there for their winter holidays since the mid-1990s. The Minneapolis-based artist and writer’s bright watercolour vignettes of city life have now been collected into an expanded edition of the illustrated memoir he first published in 2015. “Paris is special in winter because there are fewer tourists and the city is more intimate, more itself,” he says. “Dinners are elaborate.
