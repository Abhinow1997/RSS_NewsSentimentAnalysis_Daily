Her dark boater hat was worn so low that it threw her entire face into shadow, and made eye contact with cameras or guests impossible.Matched with severe, high-necked tailoring, it was a startlingly sombre fashion choice on what might have been expected to be a day of joy for the wife of the new president. Melania, who absented herself from the limelight for long stretches of Trump’s first term, seemed to show little more enthusiasm about the second. “Dark Maga” and “mob wife at a funeral” were among the verdicts on social media.

The Guardian,"Ukraine war briefing: ‘Conflict will not end tomorrow or day after,’ says Macron as Trump takes office","French president tells Europe to ‘wake up’ and spend more on defence; captured North Korean soldier says many casualties. What we know on day 1,063 The French president, Emmanuel Macron, warned that Russia’s war against Ukraine would not end “tomorrow or the day after” as Donald Trump, who pledged to quickly wind up the conflict, returned to the White House. Trump promised over the summer to end Russia’s war against Ukraine “in 24 hours”, although he did not explain how he planned to do that. “Let us not delude ourselves,” Macron said in his new year’s address to the French armed forces. “This conflict will not end tomorrow or the day after.” The third anniversary of Russia’s war against Ukraine approaches next month, and Trump’s administration has more recently been suggesting a timeline of several months to end it.Macron also called on Europe to “wake up” and spend more on defence in order to reduce its reliance on the US. Macron said expected changes in Washington’s foreign policy, especially regarding the war in Ukraine, were an “opportunity for a European strategic wake-up call”. “What will we do in Europe tomorrow if our American ally withdraws its warships from the Mediterranean? If they send their fighter jets from the Atlantic to the Pacific?” he asked. “The answer will have to come from us.” Providing lasting support to Ukraine was key, and Ukraine must receive “guarantees” against any return of the war on its territory when hostilities cease, while Europe must “play its full role” in the process, Macron said.Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, has hailed the opportunity to achieve a just peace in Ukraine as he congratulated Trump on his inauguration as US president. “President Trump is always decisive, and the peace-through-strength policy he announced provides an opportunity to strengthen American leadership and achieve a long-term and just peace, which is the top priority,” Zelenskyy said. He was looking forward to active and “mutually beneficial” cooperation with the Trump administration. “We are stronger together, and we can provide greater security, stability, and economic growth to the world and our two nations.”One of two North Korean soldiers captured by Ukraine in Russia’s Kursk region has apparently told interrogators that Pyongyang’s troops fighting for Moscow are suffering serious losses, according to official video published by Ukraine on Monday. He said he was brought to Russia from North Korea in what he believed was a cargo vessel with around 100 others and they were then transported by sleeper train. The soldier said he was conscripted aged 17 and had been serving since then. He repeated a claim from a previous video that he had not known he was being sent to Russia to fight.Ukraine’s state investigation bureau the DBR said it had detained two generals and a colonel suspected of negligence in failing to adequately defend against a Russian offensive in the Kharkiv region in 2024. The DBR said they were the former chief commander of the Kharkiv frontline, a former commander of a brigade and a former commander of an infantry battalion. Russia launched an assault across the border in May 2024 into Ukraine’s northern region of Kharkiv, advancing by several kilometres in the first few days. Ukraine’s military was eventually able to halt the Russian advance about 25km away from the edge of Kharkiv.The Russian-backed leader of separatist Transnistria said his unofficial government was ready to buy gas from Moldova, the legitimate government, more than two weeks after Russian supplies halted when Ukraine refused to continue letting Moscow’s gas go through its territory. The Moldovan government said it was “reviewing Tiraspol’s [Transnistria’s] request to ensure it complies with national and international legal standards”.Russia recorded a budget deficit of more than 3tn roubles for the third year running in 2024, the finance ministry said on Monday, with both spending and revenue rising sharply as Moscow ploughed economic resources into the war in Ukraine. The shortfall narrowed as a percentage of gross domestic product to 1.7% – from 1.9% in 2023 – the data showed, but was significantly wider than the ministry’s initial plans for a deficit at 0.9% of GDP. Excluding crucial revenues from oil and gas, however, the deficit widened to 7.3% of GDP, from 7% of GDP in 2023. Continue reading...","Tue, 21 Jan 2025 00:48:08 GMT",-0.5994,-0.9514

Look at the world in 2025 and you can easily see why it is such vital viewingThis month is the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp in German-occupied Poland, and, in Jordan Dunbar’s documentary What Happened at Auschwitz, there is a sense of these chances to remember running out. Most obviously that’s true in terms of being able to speak directly to the survivors: Dunbar meets a handful of them, and their clarity and focus are undimmed, yet their numbers are declining.Dunbar, however, assigns his subject matter another, different urgency. We live, he observes, in an era of disinformation and rising hatred. A terrifying percentage of online content and commentary about the Holocaust questions whether it happened or celebrates that it did. Less than a century since this appalling crime against humanity, the principle of Never Again is wobbling. Continue reading...","Mon, 20 Jan 2025 21:00:07 GMT",0.25,0.4383

Now he’s back to the thing he’s been longing to do, he says, after four exhausting months of cha cha, quickstep and American smooth: sitting on a stool for a while, telling jokes.He’s good at it: those 21 years weren’t wasted. ‘Yonks!’, by his own admission, is about nothing in particular. It plants a flag in familiar standup territory and – hey, the guy’s tired – seldom roams far beyond. There’s a lot of “back in the day”, as McCausland reminisces about his delinquent childhood and life before smart technology. There’s the odd name-dropping yarn from his life as a TV star, but they’re outnumbered by tales insisting upon his Everybloke credentials – like the resolutely anti-PC joke set in his local pub, or the closing anecdote about a recent rectal examination.Touring until 18 May 2026 Continue reading...","Mon, 20 Jan 2025 13:13:34 GMT",0.6239,0.9545

The Guardian,"‘Jean-Paul Sartre hid at her house!’ The forgotten brilliance of Hélène de Beauvoir, sister of Simone","She was a painter ‘ahead of her time’, counting Picasso as a fan. But Hélène de Beauvoir was always overshadowed by her famous sister. Now, with a show opening in Britain, the artist is finally receiving her dueSimone de Beauvoir, the French feminist icon, novelist and philosopher who bestrode the 20th century, had a younger sister called Hélène. She was not famous like Simone but she was every bit as radical and prolific, as both a feminist and a painter. It seems ridiculous that history would have sidelined this woman whose work Picasso complimented at her first Paris show in 1936, calling it “original”. She was also president of a women’s refuge, and signed 1971’s influential Manifesto of the 343 Women, in which the signatories all admitted to having had an illegal abortion.

The Guardian,Elon Musk stands accused of pretending to be good at video games. The irony is delicious | Keza MacDonald,"Musk desperately wants to appropriate gamer credibility, but he may be faking it – and doing exactly what toxic nerds have been accusing women of doing for decadesLast year on Joe Rogan’s podcast, Elon Musk claimed to be one of the world’s best Diablo IV players – and surprisingly, the leaderboards backed him up. For those that haven’t had the pleasure, Diablo is one of the most mercilessly time-intensive video games out there; you build a character and carve through armies of demons, spending hundreds of hours refining skills and equipment for maximum hellspawn-cleansing efficiency. I played it for maybe five hours last year and immediately quit, for fear that it would consume my life. Most of the people who play it are young, often male, and have plenty of time to themselves to spend on the internet and playing games – so, the exact demographic of many Musk stans.It suited these hardcore gamer guys to believe that someone who tweets all day and runs several businesses was also an elite player who poured hundreds of hours into Diablo. This made him relatable. It fed into his preferred image of being the hardest-working man alive. But then Elon made the mistake of actually playing a game live on X, and it became clear very quickly that something was amiss. It seems Elon Musk might be a fake gamer.
 On 7 January, Musk played Path of Exile 2, a very Diablo-like hack-and-slash game that came out towards the end of last year. His character was extremely well-equipped; suspiciously so. Viewers noted that he had better gear than some of the professional streamers who play this game all day every day, and he didn’t seem to know what their stats meant. I have not played Path of Exile 2 and so I can’t independently assess these claims – unlike Musk, apparently, I am quite happy to admit when I’m not an expert on a particular game – but within a few hours the many inconsistencies in his play and commentary were laid out exactingly on Reddit and in YouTube videos. (He also posted a suspiciously rubbish Elden Ring build back in 2022, which was dredged up as further evidence.) Evidently Musk forgot that we nerds are known for our attention to detail.

The Guardian,The Israel-Gaza ceasefire deal hangs by a thread. This is what must happen for peace to last | Simon Tisdall,"Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas both have reasons to collapse the agreement. Honest brokers must do all they can to keep it aliveThe defiant appearance of heavily armed Hamas fighters during Sunday’s handover to the Red Cross of three Israeli hostages held in Gaza since the 7 October 2023 terrorist atrocities was a sinister reminder, if one were needed, that the ceasefire deal negotiated last week hangs by a thread – and could snap at any moment.The basic problem, going forward, is that neither Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, nor Hamas’s reconstituted leadership, truly wants the truce to endure. Netanyahu was strong-armed, metaphorically kicking and screaming, into agreeing the deal by Donald Trump and his special Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.Simon Tisdall is the Observer’s foreign affairs commentatorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

His wife, Victoria, the granddaughter of Polish Jews who fled to sanctuary in England, stood beside him in the biting cold looking out over the tracks that once ferried unimaginable numbers of people to their deaths.Afterwards, the prime minister talked about the relics of the dead discovered when the concentration camp was liberated: the piles of shoes, many in children’s sizes, and the suitcases hurriedly packed by people forced from their homes.

I don’t know about you, but the January 2025 time loop has broken me: my blood has become toxic ectoplasm and my bones are jelly worms. I don’t so much live the 43 minutes of daylight we get in North Yorkshire as sullenly, listlessly exist through them.

The Guardian,Are the class of 2025 really the worst Manchester United team of all time?,"Ruben Amorim thinks so, but other managers have faced similar struggles. Here is a trip down memory lane to some of the worst crises at Old Trafford …If United’s current state feels like a lost decade, then the 1930s were its progenitor, much of it spent in the second tier, fans yearning for the early 1900s glory years under Ernest Mangnall, one of only three United managers – with Matt Busby and Alex Ferguson – to win the league title. United finished last in the First Division at the end of the 1930-31 season, winning seven games, losing their opening 12, conceding 115 goals, the manager Herbert Bamlett, better known as a referee, sacked with six fixtures to play. The previous owner, John Henry Davies, who had funded the Mangnall years, had died in 1927, stretching finances. According to the author Eamon Dunphy, the final game, with Middlesbrough, drew 3,900 to Old Trafford, an “uncanny atmosphere” with “the shouts of derision echoing through the empty grandstand”. United would spend the next couple of seasons fighting off relegation to the Third Division North. Continue reading...","Mon, 20 Jan 2025 20:00:05 GMT",-0.3774,0.8807
The Guardian,Cucurella and Madueke get Chelsea back to winning ways against Wolves,"There were times when Enzo Maresca seemed to have the weight of the world on his shoulders. The Italian mooched around his technical area, bemoaning Chelsea’s frantic play and calling for calm. Panic had set in after another lead was frittered away, shoddy handling from the erratic Robert Sánchez gifting a mediocre Wolves an equaliser at the end of an average first half, and the winless Premier League run was in danger of ticking up to six.However, while Sánchez remains an accident waiting to happen in goal, at least Chelsea had a second half to correct matters against one of the leakiest defences in the Premier League. The nerves faded when Marc Cucurella restored the advantage after an hour. Authority returned and although this was far from Chelsea’s most stylish win of the season, it was enough to capitalise on Newcastle’s setback against Bournemouth and see Maresca’s side take fourth place off Manchester City before they visit the champions on Saturday.

The Guardian,Australia eye Ashes whitewash as depth leaves England with no answers | Geoff Lemon,"Stars such as Alyssa Healy and Ash Gardner not missed as home side close in on cleansweep against overhyped rivals“England’s best format is T20.” It’s been a mantra through this Women’s Ashes series so far. With Australia the stronger team, and the series starting with the 50-over format in which they dominate, it was repeated by England followers, repeated by media wanting a close series for the story, even flashed up in the television blurb describing the first 20-over match from the SCG. As those one-day internationals were lost one after the other, the insistence has developed a ring of desperation, like “I can quit any time or want” or “I’m fine to drive”.The problem is, if England’s best style is the short one, they still have to play it against the country who have won six T20 World Cups. In Sydney, England didn’t field a single batter with a career strike rate above 130. Australia fielded Phoebe Litchfield, Annabel Sutherland, Tahlia McGrath, Grace Harris and Georgia Wareham. A team missing their captain, Alyssa Healy, and their matchwinner from the previous outing, Ash Gardner, didn’t miss a beat. If T20 is England’s best format, every format is Australia’s best format.

It was a historic day as the club, together with Southampton, became the first to pilot alcohol in the stands at a Women’s Championship game.Drinking in view of the pitch is not allowed in the top five men’s leagues in England.

Coupled with an expected squeeze on departmental spending, and the latest warning from a House of Lords committee that the present system is “unsustainable”, the prospect of a new consultation ramps up the pressure on the work and pensions secretary, Liz&nbsp;Kendall, to come up with a policy to match her rhetoric.Ms Kendall rejects the language of her Conservative opponents – for example, the claim by Mel Stride, her predecessor, that people were being signed off work by doctors because they felt “bluesy”. Her vision for reform involves closer coordination with the NHS, enhanced support for people who are economically inactive, and stronger local oversight of job centres and training. In November, she set out her ambition for a “genuine public employment service”, including work coaches to support people through the transition back into work.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This was a facade. Mr&nbsp;Trump’s address feigned conciliation but was, in reality, a rightwing call to arms against his enemies, rejecting the unity the ceremony represents. Mr Trump presented a grim picture of a country on its knees that only he can revitalise. He declared not one but two national emergencies, pledging to return “millions of criminal aliens” and “drill, baby, drill” for the “liquid gold under our feet”. His alarming call to “take back” the Panama Canal from China hints at ambitions to reshape the global order, potentially through force.A flurry of Trumpian executive orders will accelerate the climate emergency, defy the US constitution over birthright citizenship and reduce the scope of legal protections. Forget the stirring rhetoric of Kennedy; Trump’s message was blunt: enemies at home and abroad, beware.

Plus a letter from Phil TateYour editorial (14 January) rightly critiques Rachel Reeves’s adherence to Treasury orthodoxy. But the persistence of this framework goes deeper than institutional inertia. It reflects a failure to recognise a choice at all – and an inability to imagine and craft better alternatives.Treasury orthodoxy is rooted in the Thatcher-Reagan era. It is not just outdated, but has become invisible to those who wield it. Traditional economic training teaches policymakers to see fiscal discipline and market reassurance not just as good options but as the only ones. This narrow view blinds them to evidence that transformative public investment, targeted redistribution and state-led solutions can be essential to tackle inequality, stagnation and the environmental crisis.

Wetsuit tech has come a long way in recent years and now offer far greater protection against the cold. This shift has meant more of us are surfing all year round, even in the chilliest of British winters.But such innovation has come at a cost, as explained in The Big Sea, a documentary made by two surfers from the north-east of England.

Ahead of a new film, we meet the man who’s spent eight years piecing those extraordinary scraps of music back togetherEight years ago, Leo Geyer was at the museum that now stands at Auschwitz-Birkenau, when he got chatting to an archivist. It was a conversation that would change his life.“It was actually an accident,” says the musician and composer. “He just said in an offhand way that there were music manuscripts buried in the depths of the archive.” Geyer knew about the orchestras of Auschwitz concentration camp, “as most classical musicians do”, he adds. But he had no idea there were any manuscripts left after the Nazis tried to liquidate the camp before the arrival of the Red Army. The majority of artefacts from Auschwitz were destroyed – and Geyer, like most before him, assumed this would include the music. Continue reading...","Mon, 20 Jan 2025 16:02:33 GMT",-0.3182,-0.7269

The Guardian,Claire van Kampen: a world-class theatre composer and bright star of Shakespeare’s Globe,"The pianist, director and playwright of Farinelli and the King, which starred her husband Mark Rylance, is remembered by the Globe’s former artistic directorClaire van Kampen, theatre director and composer, dies aged 71On the first afternoon of rehearsals for any new show, I would ask Claire to push past the awkwardness and nerves of new beginnings with some group singing. Within a couple of hours, her galvanic energy and shining eyes would have a group of strangers harmonising together with a gusto they had not felt since childhood. Ten days ago, when she first went under palliative care in a German clinic, a devoted community on WhatsApp formed and then grew, to feed messages to her through Mark, her husband, and her daughter, Juliet. Anecdotes of Claire in excelsis were shared, some ribald, some tender and others filthy; old photos of her dazzly smile accumulated; insights which Claire had rained on the world for free were appreciated; and tears were spilt over how remorselessly she had spread light. Even under sedation, Claire could still get a wide and diverse group from across the world to sing together.Claire was all art. A piano prodigy as a youth, she became one of the world’s great theatre composers, whose work was heard at the RSC, the National, the Globe and eventually everywhere. No one has ever set a Shakespearean song better than her – her versions of the closing songs to Twelfth Night and Love’s Labour’s Lost are definitive; no one knew better how to drive a story with percussion; how to detonate some humour into a room with some oompah, nor how to make 1,000 hearts skip a beat with a single plaintive human voice. The Renaissance and her were natural companions – something about the openness and candour of that age, together with its bubbling humanity, found a natural interpreter in her.

The Guardian,"In The Seagull, Cate Blanchett and Thomas Ostermeier could make small details seismic | Michael Billington","The Oscar winner stars in the German director’s production of the Chekhov classic where ‘everything is open to interpretation’How does one stage Chekhov? His plays, embodying symphonic realism and equipped with precise visual and aural effects, would seem to defy massive reinterpretation. Yet we live in an age of director’s theatre and Benedict Andrews with Three Sisters and The Cherry Orchard and Katie Mitchell and Jamie Lloyd with The Seagull have all, with varying degrees of success, offered distinctive visions of the plays. Next month sees another Seagull, “conceived and directed by Thomas Ostermeier”, coming to London’s Barbican with a cast headed by Cate Blanchett and Tom Burke. As a great admirer of Ostermeier’s radical updates of Ibsen – especially An Enemy of the People – I shall be fascinated to see how far he goes with Chekhov, in an adaptation by Duncan Macmillan.Having seen a flock of Seagulls over the years, I am struck by the seismic impact of small differences: in other words, casting, context and interpretation of character can alter one’s perspective without disrupting the period or setting. The first Seagull I ever saw, as a student critic, was an Old Vic production by John Fernald that opened at the Edinburgh festival in 1960. It was everything I had imagined classic English Chekhov to be except for one thing: the fact that Konstantin, the struggling young writer, was played by a 23-year-old actor fresh out of Rada and with a strong northern accent.

The Guardian,"The gig economy: ticket inflation is getting worse, so where does all the money go?","Taylor Swift’s Eras tour and the Gallaghers’ ill-fated dabble with dynamic pricing have put the spotlight on how much we’re willing to pay for live music. But, on the other side of the equation, the costs can be exorbitant and the risks are eye-wateringThe news that Oasis were to reunite sparked a wave of euphoria across the nation at the end of last summer. But the nostalgia balloon was quickly punctured by the discovery that the tickets, initially priced at £148.50, had suddenly leapt to £355.20 due to dynamic pricing. The outcry quickly sparked a new debate about what constitutes a “fair” price for gig tickets, with the band themselves fanning the flames: Liam Gallagher told those bellyaching about the lack&nbsp;of transparency to “SHUTUP” and&nbsp;buy “Kneeling only” tickets for £100,000 instead.Dynamic pricing, where the cost rises in real time in lockstep with demand, is hardly new. Parallels are often made with the surge pricing used on budget airlines and taxi-booking apps, although in the case of&nbsp;gig tickets, dynamic pricing means&nbsp;the price can rise in the few seconds it takes for consumers to complete their booking.

The Guardian,A sprawling megacity of multi-level madness: why Chongqing in China is my wonder of the world,"This megacity is like Hong Kong on steroids – a vertically sprawling, astonishing urban phenomenon that can only be understood in three dimensionsGoogle Maps can be unreliable at the best of times when you’re travelling in China, but in the southern megacity of Chongqing, a map of any kind turns out to be almost entirely useless. Built across a series of impossibly steep mountainsides and vertiginous valleys at the dramatic confluence of the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers, it is an astonishing urban phenomenon to behold – a vertically sprawling city that can only be understood in three dimensions.
 It is a place where neighbourhoods cling to cliffs, connected by elevated roads 20 storeys up in the air. Metro lines emerge from tunnels through the mountains, only to plunge straight through the middle of residential skyscrapers, which themselves sprout improbably from the sheer slopes. Something that looks close by on the map can turn out to be tens of storeys above or below you. And getting there usually makes for an exhilarating journey.I first found myself in Chongqing 10 years ago, almost by accident, after my first attempt to enter North Korea was abruptly quashed when Kim Jong Un decided to close the borders overnight, because of his fears that foreigners might bring in Ebola. Stranded in Beijing with time to kill, a photographer friend recommended we head south to Chongqing. “It’s like Hong Kong on steroids,” was enough to convince me.Nothing prepares you for the multi-level madness of this sprawling metropolitan region of 32 million people. Hong Kong might be known for its elevated walkways and urban escalators that zigzag up its steep slopes, but Chongqing takes this 3D cityscape to a whole new level. To get to places that looked like a couple of blocks away, I found myself taking steep staircases that led to underground escalators, then across walkways to lifts that ferried me up the side of a cliff. Cable cars swooshed past outdoor plazas, where what I thought was the ground level turned out to be the roof terrace of an office block, which plunged 30 storeys down into the valley below.

The Guardian,I love my husband – but his yellow teeth and back hair give me the ick,"I don’t want to upset him, as he’s extremely proud and sensitive. But I am now having to grin and bear every sexual encounter we haveI love my husband of 16 years dearly and still think he is attractive but feel completely unaroused by him when we are in close proximity. As a result, our sex life has disappeared, which is causing a lot of resentment. Things that didn’t used to matter now do. I find his back hair and yellow teeth offputting. I don’t want to upset him so don’t feel I can tell him these things. He’s extremely proud and sensitive and would not react well, regardless of how softly the news was delivered. I feel that I am grinning and bearing every sexual encounter with him and he can tell. He is also the one who initiates sex and he does this through sending a text message, which I have to admit does nothing for me either. 
 We have to educate others about our needs, our likes and dislikes. You are being considerate in not wanting to hurt your husband by letting him know the things that turn you off, but frankly it would be a loving gesture to inform him of the truth, and it may just save your marriage. People who can’t deal with truth-telling (giving or receiving) are putting themselves and their relationship at risk. First, “grinning and bearing” is a very problematic choice. It can lead to a sexual pain disorder, as your body will eventually refuse to cooperate in becoming physiologically aroused. Second, only caring people who still hold out hope for continued loving and pleasurable intimacy will bravely ask their partners for changes they deem necessary; others choose other options such as withdrawal, affairs and breakups. Find a way to kindly and supportively – but firmly – encourage him to improve the fixable items. Be very specific about your preferred style of initiating sex. Always start by complimenting him for things you like, and be sure to reward him for a positive response and action.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments).

The Guardian,Send us your questions for Pamela Anderson,"Got something you’d love to ask the former Baywatch star about her life and new career directions? Now’s your chanceDirector Gia Coppola had only one actor in mind to star in The Last Showgirl: Pamela Anderson. Having watched Ryan White’s Netflix documentary Pamela, A Love Story, Coppola knew she would be perfect as Shelly Gardner, an ageing Las Vegas dancer facing the closure of Le Razzle Dazzle, the classic revue she has starred in for three decades. The problem was, Anderson’s (now former) agent threw the script in the bin. Coppola did not take no for an answer. She got in touch with Anderson’s son Brandon Thomas Lee, who made sure the pitch reached his mum. Now trailing accolades, award nominations and an Oscar buzz, the film is bringing the 57-year-old icon something she struggled to find earlier in her career: respect.Having risen to fame as a Playboy Playmate, Anderson became an international superstar in the 1990s in Baywatch, which cemented the sex-symbol image she struggled for years to shake off. Recently, however, her public persona has morphed into something much more multilayered, thanks not only to the Netflix doc but also to her thoughtful 2023 memoir Love, Pamela and her well-received Broadway debut the previous year as Roxie Hart in Chicago.

The Guardian,Has South Korea just witnessed its own January 6 moment?,"Protesters who stormed a Seoul court at the weekend may not have worn animal skins, but the similarities are strikingThey arrived intent on causing mayhem. The political figurehead they supported had, they said, been the victim of a grave injustice at the hands of the establishment. The ringleaders had soon broken through security cordons, armed with fire extinguishers, steel pipes and police shields, smashing windows and gaining entry to a government building, leaving destruction worth an estimated £400,000 in their wake.The scene of the riot was not the US Capitol building on 6 January 2021, and the mobs attempting to overturn the rule of law had swapped animal skins and bald eagle masks for hooded down jackets and face masks. But the similarities between Maga ideologues’ attempts to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election, and the far-right protesters who stormed the Seoul western district court building this weekend in support of the impeached South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, are hard to ignore.

The Guardian,"Factchecking Trump’s inauguration speech, from inflation to healthcare","Following up on key claims made by 47th US president during his day one addressDonald Trump inauguration – live updatesDonald Trump repeatedly made false and misleading claims during his inaugural address.Here are the facts on some of the false claims offered during Trump’s speech.First, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my remain in Mexico policy. I will end the practice of catch and release, and I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country.A short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and we will restore the name of a great president, William McKinley to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent. He was a natural businessman and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United States, the United States, I mean, think of this spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal. We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made and Panama’s promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharge, charged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form. And that includes the United States navy and above all, China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama and we’re taking it back.I will direct all members of my cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices. The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices.We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world.We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders, but refuses to defend American borders, or, more importantly, its own people. Our country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina been treated so badly and other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago. Or more recently in Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense. They’re raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country, some of whom are sitting here right now. They don’t have a home any longer. That’s interesting. We can’t let this happen.We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad. It fails to protect our magnificent law abiding American citizens, but provide sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.Trump embraces role of demagogue, claims to be ‘peacemaker’ – follow live inauguration updatesFactchecking Trump’s speechElon Musk appears to make back-to-back fascist salutesActivists ask: is there any point in mass protest?

The Guardian,"‘Stuff happens and it sucks’: Brooke Shields on abuse, ageing and telling her own story","Brooke Shields, sexualised child star at just 11, is no stranger to tabloid controversy. Now 59, perhaps now she can tell us how she ended up so… normal?Brooke Shields was at a party, drifting off. The host, a small man with bare feet, was giving her a tour of his wine cellar and she was losing interest, if she’s being honest – which she is now as a matter of principle, after a lifetime of smiling politely and pretending everything’s fine. Her mind was wandering. They say wine gets better with age, she was thinking, “but isn’t there a moment when it turns to jam? And I said to him, ‘I’m 58 and I’m wondering if…’ I didn’t even get the rest of the sentence out before he said, ‘Oh, I wish you hadn’t told me that.’”That’s curious, she replied. “I asked him, ‘Did my age make him older?’ I was interested in the psychology of it, that kneejerk reaction.” It was partly, she thinks, her fame – people imprint on a child star, and when they grow up they take it personally. “It felt so indicative of what we do to women, too. And we do the same thing to ourselves – we get caught up, chasing something that’s gone.” It wasn’t the first time somebody had taken offence at the fact she was no longer 15 and she knew it would not be the last, but it was this conversation that inspired her new book about fame, women and the complexity of ageing. She’s called it, Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed To Get Old. Continue reading...","Sun, 19 Jan 2025 07:00:47 GMT",-0.6369,0.963
The Guardian,Luca is the progenitor of all life on Earth. But its genesis has implications far beyond our planet,"New research into the single-celled organism is providing clues about what the early planet looked like – and raising the prospect that we may not be alone in the universeFor scientists, our earliest ancestor wasn’t Adam or Eve but Luca. Luca didn’t look anything like us – it was a single-celled bacterium-like organism. A recent study by a team of scientists based in the UK has delivered rather shocking news about this illustrious forebear. Despite having lived almost as far back as seems possible, Luca was surprisingly similar to modern bacteria – and what’s more, it apparently lived in a thriving community of other organisms that have left no trace on Earth today.Luca – short for the last universal common ancestor, the progenitor of all known life on Earth – seems to have been born 4.2bn years ago. Back then our planet was no Eden but something of a hell on Earth: a seething mass of volcanoes pummelled by giant meteorites, and having recovered from a cosmic collision that blasted the world apart and created the moon from some of the fragments. There is good reason why the geological aeon before 4bn years ago is called the Hadean, after the Greek god of the underworld Hades. Continue reading...","Sun, 19 Jan 2025 11:00:05 GMT",0.0,-0.4642
