Writer-director Jacques Audiard apologised and the controversy didn’t seem to massively hurt the film’s Oscar chances, as it led the 2025 field with 13 nominations including best actress for Gascón. However, a few days later, a journalist inspected Gascón’s social media feed and found a string of inflammatory posts, including one that described Islam as “a hotbed for infection for humanity that urgently need[s] to be cured”. Gascón has since been on a contrition tour, including a tearful, hour-long interview with CNN in which she declared: “My most sincere apologies to all the people who may have felt offended by the ways I express myself in my past, in my present and in my future”, but it looks like there’s no way back.

Has it made them rethink their own love lives?Before Nicola Walker and Stephen Mangan appeared on The One Show last year to promote the Christmas special of their BBC divorce drama The Split, they were warned not to go into too much detail about their next project: Mike Bartlett’s three-hander Unicorn, in which they play Polly and Nick, a married couple who bring a younger woman called Kate into their relationship.Walker, joined by her co-stars in an empty London theatre bar, sets the scene: “We were told: ‘This is a tea-time show, so don’t say anything about the, um, sexual nature of the play.’” The three actors are seated today in a row behind a table, rather as if they are interviewing me for a job. Sandwiched between Walker and Mangan, suitably enough, is Erin Doherty, who starred as Princess Anne in The Crown and will complete the on-stage throuple.

The Guardian,Boarders series two review – the lovable teen comedy gets even more impressive,"The BBC’s boarding school satire is back and brimming with sex, laughs, super-cringe slam poetry and superstar performances – proof that it’s up there with the finest British coming-of-age showsStanding on stage at the St Gilbert’s School showcase, acting headteacher Carol Watlington-Geese (Niky Wardley) has some words of encouragement for the teens performing their drama monologues, and the parents paying their handsome fees. “Who knows,” she cackles, a not-so-subtle smirk lingering across her face. “We may have the next Eddie Redmayne or Tom Hiddleston among us!” That might sound innocent, but like most things in Boarders it isn’t, because Eddie Redmayne and Tom Hiddleston are white and the scholarship kids Watlington-Geese is desperately trying to get rid of are all black. St Gilbert’s, she later tells one of the group, is all about “team players, not troublemakers” – and she had decided who the troublemakers were from the start.Daniel Lawrence Taylor’s satirical teen comedy first aired early last year. It is set at an exclusive boarding school where the students in question have been enlisted to make over a reputation that is stale, male, pale and generally appalling. Rupert, Carol’s son no less, has been filmed pouring champagne over a homeless man (if this sounds outlandish, it is only slightly worse than the infamous case of a Cambridge student who burned a £20 note in front of a man who was sleeping rough). Enter stage left: five new students, all young, gifted and black, who have been shipped in from the big smoke by their mentor, Gus (played by Taylor). He reminds them of their talents but warns them to keep their heads down. Of course, that is easier said than done: Leah (Jodie Campbell) is grossed out by the school’s colonial vibes, which she likens to Get Out, Jordan Peele’s 2017 horror comedy about race, and quickly makes an enemy of the then headmaster, while Femi (Aruna Jalloh) is led astray by the popular kids, whose hazing rituals blur the line between friendship and bullying. Meanwhile, Jaheim (Josh Tedeku) remains embroiled in problems at home on his London estate; Omar (Myles Kamwendo) is more interested in joining a secret society than studying; and class clown Toby (Sekou Diaby) is accused of dealing drugs. There are laughs, romance, sex, drama – and a strong possibility that the gang might not make it through their A-levels. Continue reading...","Mon, 03 Feb 2025 21:50:03 GMT",0.8777,0.9249

The global fightback must start now | Gaby Hinsliff,"Britain is less vulnerable to US tariffs than other nations, but shares a historic responsibility. A recession would  mean dark days for everyoneCan a country ever be too big to fail? Waiting for global stock markets to open this morning felt grimly reminiscent of the beginnings of the sub-prime lending crash, the moment many finally understood the old cliche that when the US sneezes, everyone catches a cold. But when it threatens to hack its nose off with a chainsaw, before changing its mind at 10 minutes to midnight, then nobody knows where they stand.The world’s biggest economy is now experiencing what looks like its very own Liz Truss moment, only this time in a country powerful enough to take everyone else down with it. If the US really is prepared to keep playing this mad game of chicken – threatening ruinous tariffs against Mexico then postponing them, sowing fear and discord constantly among its allies – that risks creating the kind of all-American supernova that sucks everyone into a black hole.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Bridget Jones is a welcome reminder of a much more comfortable era | Zoe Williams,"She worried about her drinking, smoking and weight – but there was never any doubt she would have a job and be able to pay her rent. It’s a very different world for gen ZIt is 29 years since the book Bridget Jones’s Diary was published, but the column itself, which ran in the Independent (without a byline for Helen Fielding, although everyone knew it was her) and the Daily Telegraph, is 30 years old this year. That’s two years younger than our heroine when she first appears, a patchwork wreck of singleton-anxiety, professional disaster, chardonnay, Silk Cut and weighing scales. And maybe being old enough to remember with clarity anything from 30 years ago predisposes you to think of it affectionately. But, actually, no: some things were better for women, better for young people, better for everyone, in 1995. And some things were worse. To coincide with the fourth film, out on Valentine’s Day, here’s the audit.The startling thing about the comic creation was how completely she lacked any kind of self-discipline – always drinking more than she meant to, always weighing more than she intended, always determined not to smoke yet somehow also smoking. At the time, this had long been a staple for male self-fashioning: lad-mag culture was focused (ironically) on birds, but fuelled by benders. If you woke up somewhere and couldn’t remember how you got there, that was social nirvana, the ultimate night out. Ladette culture was in many ways built as a mirror to that, though a distorted one, in the sense that you had to be off your head but you couldn’t look sloppy or ill-kempt. You were meant to drink like Johnny Vegas but look like Kate Moss. Continue reading...","Mon, 03 Feb 2025 13:47:25 GMT",0.7645,0.9689

Now the region is thrust in the global spotlightThe enormous semi-enclosed bay, its waters flanked by the Florida and Yucatán peninsulas and partially blockaded by Cuba, has been called the Golfo de México for centuries, a name that first appeared on a world map in 1550. And for centuries the name bothered no one.Thomas Jefferson used the name without shame, even as he, Donald Trump-like, imagined dominating nearby nations. If the US could take Cuba, Jefferson wrote in 1823, it would control the “Gulf of Mexico and the countries and isthmus bordering on it”.

On a recent Wednesday afternoon, the car park was full and the cafe was bustling with people my parents’ age and older, chatting over milky coffees and slices of cake. The retired ladies who talk to me in the gym changing room love to come here for a jacket potato after their aquafit class.Yet, as I stepped through the automatic doors, the plants weren’t immediately visible. First, I had to pass a bright deli counter, an area filled with homeware and crockery, shelves of fragrant toiletries, and a section of children’s toys before anything remotely connected to gardening came into view. I waded through gloves, power tools, pesticides and outdoor furniture, and then, finally, I found the annual bedding plants and potted shrubs. Here, all was quiet. The gardening section was quite unlike the busy cafe; I was alone but for one member of staff.Claire Ratinon is an organic food grower and writer Continue reading...","Mon, 03 Feb 2025 13:09:31 GMT",0.0,0.9001
The Guardian,Trump 2.0 is exposing American exceptionalism for what it is – and has always been | Nesrine Malik,"Guantánamo Bay? Imperialism? Alliances with billionaires? Those shocked at the president’s early moves have forgotten what came beforeThe dust briefly settled, only for it to be kicked up once again. Donald Trump’s flurry of executive orders – causing chaos on everything from foreign aid to world trade – is rapidly rocking and reshaping domestic and foreign policy. And the temptation is, yet again, to think of Donald Trump as an exogenous shock to US democracy. But look closer, and you will see not a rogue president taking a hammer to a hitherto stable political order, but a history of the erosion of norms that paved the way for him.Political norms are the scaffolding of democracy, enforced not by the law, but by a sort of social consensus. They are not codified, strict mechanisms for regulating political facts – such as the separation of powers – but the agreement that such things should be respected and observed. A clear case in point is the president’s ability to issue pardons. And Joe Biden’s pardoning of his family members was as much an injury to norms as Trump’s pardoning of those convicted after 6 January.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Mon, 03 Feb 2025 06:00:32 GMT",-0.2732,0.9184
The Guardian,AstraZeneca’s £450m Speke U-turn looks terrible for a pro-growth government | Nils Pratley,"It seems bizarre that ministers and UK’s largest company cannot complete investment in vital life sciences sectorThe announcement in March last year that AstraZeneca would be investing £450m to expand its vaccine plant in Speke in Liverpool was presented in full flag-waving style by the company and the government of the day.Sir Pascal Soriot, the AstraZeneca chief executive, reflected it had been 25 years since the merger of Astra of Sweden and Zeneca of the UK; the firm was now “truly global” but also “proud of our British roots”. Jeremy Hunt, then the chancellor, said the £450m investment, plus £200m to expand its research facility in Cambridge, was “a vote of confidence in the attractiveness of the UK as a life sciences superpower”.

The Guardian,The 2025 Grammys celebrated pop being back to its agenda-setting best | Alexis Petridis,"It was heartening – if no surprise – to see Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar, Charli xcx and Chappell Roan all grab gongs, while an award for the Beatles suggests confidence in AI• News: Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar lead Grammy awards in aftermath of LA fires• Grammy awards 2025: list of winners• Gallery: Taylor Swift, Charli xcx, Chappell Roan and moreLike all major awards ceremonies, the Grammys spawn a mini-industry in predictions: in the weeks before the winners are announced, a rash of articles inevitably appear in which expert voices scan the nominations and foretell who’s going to win. This year, you didn’t really need in-depth knowledge of the music industry or the Recording Academy’s internal machinations to work out what was going to happen, unless there was a major upset.Across the previous 12 months, a succession of artists impacted in a way that pop music is no longer supposed to do. Its once-central defining role within broader popular culture is held to have been vastly diminished by social media, and yet Kendrick Lamar’s Not Like Us wasn’t just a huge commercial success, it influenced everything, from US sports to the campaign messaging of the American presidential election to sales of the fashion brands featured in its video: if you were going to dub anything the song of the year, it was obviously going to be that. Likewise, Charli xcx’s Brat, an album which caught a mood so completely, its title wound up a widely used (if nebulously defined) adjective: the notion of it ending the night unrewarded seemed fairly unthinkable (though it didn’t triumph in its biggest nominated categories).

The Guardian,The Guardian view on English Heritage: don’t take glorious days out for granted | Editorial,"Cuts could jeopardise the quality of the experience at the charity’s castles and ruins Reports that English Heritage, the charity that runs more than 400 state-owned buildings and monuments, plans to reduce its staff and opening hours as part of a cost-cutting drive should worry anyone who cares about the nation’s culture. These castles, ruins and other sites play an important part in people’s lives – particularly on weekends and holidays, when treasured memories are made. The value placed on access to these historic places can be seen from the fact that more than 1.3 million people are members. Stonehenge has 1.5 million visitors annually.It and other jewels in the charity’s crown will be left&nbsp;alone by the accountants. Winter closures are planned only at less-favoured sites where visitors are&nbsp;sparse, bosses have said. But given that membership, visitor and volunteer numbers are all up,&nbsp;it is concerning that the charity is so short of money&nbsp;that it may cut nearly 200 jobs.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Donald Trump’s power grab: a coup veiled by chaos | Editorial,"The US president is testing the limits of executive authority, sidelining Congress and enriching allies while destabilising the global economyDonald Trump is provoking a US constitutional crisis, claiming sweeping powers to override or bypass Congress’s control over spending in a brazen attempt to centralise financial power in the executive branch. If he succeeds, Nobel laureate Paul Krugman warns, it would be a 21st-century coup – with power slipping from elected officials’ hands. The real story hidden behind the president’s trade war, he says, is the hijacking of government. And Mr Krugman’s right.By usurping the authority to shut down government programmes at will – even those funded by Congress – Mr Trump could slash federal spending and taxes while pretending to balance the books. In reality, he’d be robbing the poor to enrich the wealthy. In a world where economic jargon has been corrupted to depict exploitation as “wealth creation”, the audacity of Mr Trump – and his lackeys – to personally profit is breathtaking. Mr Trump’s philosophy is simple: let the uber-rich do whatever they want, with little or no oversight. The result will be vast wealth for a select few while life grows nastier and shorter for the many. Continue reading...","Mon, 03 Feb 2025 18:25:03 GMT",-0.5719,0.197

We must focus on what we need to do to improve our school system and challenge the view that the past 14 years were&nbsp;a great success.Doubtful claims, without robust supporting evidence, that the bill will “destroy the huge gains made over the last decade and a half” have been widely repeated.

West Ham, who played well and edged in front when Jarrod Bowen punished an error from Levi Colwill, had the meagre consolation of knowing they had given rivals with greater resources a scare.This was not convincing from Chelsea, even if they rose into the top four thanks to an equaliser from the excellent Pedro Neto and a Cole Palmer-inspired own goal from Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Enzo Maresca’s team were pallid for long spells and irritation was rising before a sudden surge overwhelmed an injury‑hit West Ham, who still summoned sufficient effort to rally and almost force an equaliser when Tosin Adarabioyo thwarted Mohammed Kudus in added time.

Now, a more tangible assault is gathering pace under Donald Trump – aimed squarely at wind, solar and other cleaner forms of power.In the first two weeks of his return as president, Trump has, like his first term, issued orders to open up more American land and waters for fossil fuel extraction and started the process to yank the US from the Paris climate agreement. “We will drill, baby drill,” said Trump, who has promised to cut energy and electricity prices in half within 18 months.

Trifonov unquestionably commands the restraint of dynamics that Schumann’s scoring requires from the soloist – his passagework was exemplary. But he was unafraid of making weightier keyboard statements too, even in the opening bars and especially in the first movement cadenza. Continue reading...","Mon, 03 Feb 2025 16:58:36 GMT",0.0,0.9727

The Guardian,Civilization VII review – your empire strikes back in glorious new detail,"PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox; 2K Games/Fireaxis The fiendishly addictive sim returns with compelling fresh challenges across the ages. Prepare to say goodbye to a lot of free timeMany years ago, when Civilization II was on its way, I’d just started as a writer on the video game magazine Edge. As a fan of the original Civilization, a complex turn-based strategy sim about building vast kingdoms through thousands of years of human history, I was keen to review the sequel and my editor let me. Reader, I became completely addicted. I played the game for two weeks non-stop, leaving many pages of the magazine unwritten. This earned me a very severe written warning. In short, Sid Meier’s series almost ended my career in games writing – which is perhaps why I didn’t review the following four instalments. Now it is back, and I can no longer avoid it. I must face my seductive nemesis.In many ways, this is the game that I, and many thousands of other fans, have always known and obsessively loved: a complex, far-reaching and fascinating simulation tracking the rise of empires from ancient tribal groups to modern-day superpowers. As a player, you found towns and cities, gather resources and research new technologies, from literacy to nuclear fission, while sending out settlers, merchants and armies to expand your reach and either placate or destroy other nations. Victory can come from military might, cultural cachet or economic domination, depending on how you play and what you’re interested in. No two campaigns are ever the same.

The Guardian,From Drake’s humiliation to Doechii’s coronation: the talking points from the 2025 Grammys,"Kendrick Lamar celebrated his rap beef victory in a ‘Canadian tuxedo’, Chappell Roan called out the industry and Nashville finally backed Beyoncé• Grammy awards 2025: list of winnersIt’s the kind of stress dream that pop stars tell their therapists about: “My artistic rival won record and song of the year at the Grammys for a track attacking me, and everyone was dancing and singing along. Even Beyoncé.” And so it came to pass for Drake, seeing Kendrick Lamar win for Not Like Us, walking to the podium in double denim – a “Canadian tuxedo”, no less – while half the arena seemed to chant “tryna strike a chord and it’s probably a minor”, a line alleging child sexual abuse (which Drake has strenuously denied). Drake has long framed the Grammys as somewhere that doesn’t understand rap music and he had already distanced himself from the awards – and perhaps that turned Recording Academy voters against him all the more. But these were deserved wins for Lamar – the beef allowed him to turn his lens away from himself, and in so doing made a very 21st-century entertainment: gossipy, networked, and packed with reference. Meanwhile, having seen the entire industry united in celebration against him makes you wonder anew: where next for Drake? Continue reading...","Mon, 03 Feb 2025 14:27:50 GMT",-0.5719,0.9036

It means January is over, which is cause for celebration already. The end-of-season sale rails have gone, so shop windows are again a source of new ideas. The weather is still rubbish, obviously, but the light is coming back: with a pinch of luck, you may even see daylight on the way home from the office by the end of February. The first snowdrops are nearly here. I like Valentine’s Day, which I know is deeply uncool of me, but I like pink and I like chocolate, so what’s not to love?But February can be a challenge to dress for.

Please keep reading for a puffer coat update and a fresh layering formula, not to mention a top-tier edit of the most delectable and affordable treats I’ve scouted from February’s shelves.

The Guardian,The food filter: which supermarket has the best extra-virgin olive oil?,"From luxury Sicilian to budget buys, our Rome correspondent tests supermarket extra-virgin olive oils – and reveals how much you should spend • The best hot sauces, tasted and rated by Thomasina MiersYears ago, a good cook, who happened to be Greek, told me to think of olive oil not simply as liquid fat, but as an essential ingredient, as flavour and as a seasoning, with the ability to act like herbs and spices. He’s absolutely right and his excellent advice continues to motivate me when I’m choosing extra-virgin olive oil, which is the single most important ingredient I buy, and my biggest expense in the kitchen. While I do have the odd special bottle for drizzling, I am more interested in a good-tasting all-rounder that I can use for everything (my cooking is largely vegetable-, pasta-, pulse-, cheese- and egg-centric), including deep-frying (in a very small pan).Just to recap, olive oil is the liquid fat obtained by pressing olives, which are fruits. Once picked, they need to be processed as soon as possible – that is, crushed, then centrifugally spun to separate the pulp, water and oil, all in scrupulously clean machinery and at a steady temperature, which preserves the natural aromas of the olives. It takes about eight kilos of olives to make a litre of oil, which, to be considered extra-virgin olive oil, needs to have no defects and no more than 0.8% of free fatty acids. And that comes at a price: expect to pay between £14 and £18 a litre. Continue reading...","Sat, 01 Feb 2025 10:00:39 GMT",0.6369,0.9847

The Guardian,The one change that worked: I took up ballet – and learned to live in the moment,"Working long days as a corporate lawyer, I needed an exercise regime to get me out of my head. Reviving a childhood passion helped me reconnect with my bodyMy earliest memories of ballet will be familiar to many childhood dancers: ribbons, shoe fittings, hairspray (lots of it). I attended my first class at about four years old and continued off and on until my early teens, when I started to focus on other activities and on studying for exams. Since I&nbsp;was never planning to become a professional dancer, I didn’t consider that ballet would become an&nbsp;important part of my adult life. But today, at 32, it is one of my most meaningful passions – and I am so&nbsp;grateful to have rediscovered it.That happened in my early 20s, when I was a corporate lawyer in London. The job involved a lot of late nights and desk work. I was looking for a fitness class that would get me out of my head and back into my body and I stumbled across a beginner ballet class. There, I was amazed to find that I remembered some of the patterns – the position of the spine, the arm movements (port de bras) – and the French terminology. But what struck me most was how good it felt to move with a group of dancers, to adopt the discipline of the ballet technique and see myself improve&nbsp;– if&nbsp;only by a small amount – by the end&nbsp;of the class.

The Guardian,Tips for slow-cooker success | Kitchen aide,"Let the slow cooker do all the work while you’re out, and have a meal ready for when you get homeI was given a slow cooker for Christmas, but haven’t used it yet – any advice for a complete novice?Slow cookers aren’t exactly sexy, but what they lack in aesthetics, they more than make up for in meal prepping and problem-solving. Simply chuck everything in there, turn it on and a few hours later dinner is effortlessly served. No fuss, just delicious meals.But there are a few basic slow cooker rules that you need to abide by. First, the liquid: unlike the oven or hob, a slow cooker doesn’t lose as much liquid through evaporation, so even if a dish looks as if it’s not saucy enough, trust me, it very probably is, in which case adding a load of extra stock or water will just leave you with soup, which is ideal only if you’re actually making soup.
