The Guardian,David Lynch: the great American surrealist who made experimentalism mainstream,"From disturbing debut Eraserhead to his masterpiece Mulholland Drive, Lynch’s dark tales combined radical experiment with everyday AmericanaDavid Lynch, Twin Peaks and Mulholland Drive director, dies aged 78No director ever interpreted the American Dream with more artless innocence than David Lynch. It could be the title of any of his films. Lynch saw that if the US dreamed of safety and prosperity and the suburban drive and the picket fence, it also dreamed of the opposite: of escape, danger, adventure, sex and death. And the two collided and opened up chasms and sinkholes in the lost highway to happiness.Lynch was a film-maker who found portals to alternative existences and truffled in them like they were erogenous zones, moist orifices of existential possibility. He was the great American surrealist, but his vision was so distinctive that he became something other than that: a great fabulist, a great anti-narrative dissenter, his storylines splitting and swirling in non sequiturs and Escher loops. Lynch was unique, in that he took a tradition of experimentalism in movies such as Maya Deren and Alexander Hammid’s Meshes of the Afternoon and brought it into the commercial mainstream, mixing it with pulp noir, soap opera, camp comedy, erotic thriller and supernatural horror.

The Guardian,Looking for Giants review – beautifully written erotic tales of fantasy and projection,"King’s Head theatre, LondonCesca Echlin’s debut of three vignettes explores sadomasochistic dynamics, virtual romance and masturbatory pleasureSome people leave “invisible marks on your body which only you know are there,” the narrator tells us. She is speaking about men she meets and to whom she gives a fantasy life, to give an erotic charge to her own existence. They “stride across your mental landscape” and you puff them up “like balloons”. You wish they weren’t so big, but they keep you company. There are so many elegant lines in Cesca Echlin’s debut play, which was staged at the Edinburgh fringe in 2023.Directed by Echlin, it comprises three vignettes about the erotic potential of solo fantasy and projection. The first part is about a university student and her arrogant tutor, whose indifference and harsh words enact a psychic violence. But rather than heading into Oleanna territory, the student tells us she likes it. That sadomasochistic dynamic continues into the next story, in which she confesses to a man on a dating app her desire to be demeaned. He stays virtual in her life but provides masturbatory pleasure for her nonetheless. The final tale is of a romantic attraction that again does not materialise into physical reality but takes up enormous space in her imagination.At King’s Head theatre, London, until 26 January Continue reading...","Thu, 16 Jan 2025 22:00:11 GMT",0.5719,0.9658

If you want a good dating life, focus first on creating a robust social lifeRead more Leading questionsI have a bit of an embarrassing situation: I’m 24, single, a lesbian, and I’ve never been with anyone! I have had depression for a few years – a combination of family losses and years caring for my terminally ill mother, only going out to work. It’s been a lot, and I’m only just starting to feel better.People I know either met someone in school and are happily coupled up or they were able to have wild “coming-of-age” experiences at university. Lots of sex, club nights and friends. I’ve got life experience some of those people haven’t had. But I feel as though I missed out on that opportunity to practise dating and sex. 
  It seems that to meet someone nowadays it’s through work, apps or on a night out. I work in a male-dominated industry. There are no gay bars within 70 miles of me, but I’d go if I had lesbian friend to go with. I’ve tried apps. They tend to be geared to hook-ups, straight couples looking for threesomes or older folks looking for “the one”. Continue reading...","Thu, 16 Jan 2025 14:00:15 GMT",-0.3612,0.9143

The Guardian,Bangladeshi and British politics collided to bring down Tulip Siddiq | Salil Tripathi,"After allegations of corruption, the former government minister’s family legacy now lies in tatters in both countriesIt was unusual to see Muhammad Yunus, a widely respected Nobel laureate and the chief adviser of the unelected interim government of Bangladesh, taking aim at a British minister, accusing Tulip Siddiq of benefiting from “plain robbery” in his home country and calling for her to apologise. But once that happened, things moved swiftly: accusations against the beleaguered treasury minister swirled, she pulled out of an official delegation going to China, she referred herself to Laurie Magnus, the government’s adviser on ministerial standards, and finally this week she resigned from her post. (Siddiq “totally refutes” allegations of corruption.)This month, the Financial Times reported that Siddiq was given a two-bedroom central London flat by a developer closely associated with her aunt, Sheikh Hasina, the recently ousted longtime leader of Bangladesh. Siddiq had claimed she received the property from her parents, and told Magnus that she had only recently discovered it was a gift from a Bangladeshi businessman. Until 2018, she had lived in a Hampstead flat given to her sister by another businessman with connections to Hasina’s government. She lives at present in a rented property owned by a businessman linked to the British wing of the Awami League, Hasina’s political party. Siddiq was first elected to parliament in 2015, and speaking to supporters after one victory, she singled out Bangladeshi British members of the Awami League for their steadfast backing.Salil Tripathi is the author of The Colonel Who Would Not Repent: The Bangladesh War and its Unquiet Legacy.

The Guardian,How I learned to love people I disagree with (by dressing up as my mother) | Amrou Al-Kadhi,"After years of militant bravado in my art and politics, I now seek to empathise with people I used to write off as enemiesWhen I look back at some of the opinion pieces I wrote and the art I made in the 2010s, I can’t help but cringe at the conviction with which I presented myself and my work. Like many of my twentysomething contemporaries, I spoke with delusional ferocity about the “evils of the straight cis white man” and described anyone who disagreed with me as an out-and-out enemy. As a queer and Arab person in Britain who had long felt excluded from the mainstream conversation, it was thrilling to be making forceful and oppositional interventions in public debate.Thinking back to this version of myself, I understand now that my combative approach to political disagreement – which was admittedly part of the spirit of the age, marked by culture wars escalating across the social media landscape – was, in my case, a response to personal trauma. In my mid-20s I was a struggling artist carrying unprocessed feelings from the conservatism of my childhood.

The Guardian,"This Gaza ceasefire deal is tainted by Trump, Netanyahu and their disregard for peace | Simon Tisdall","From these beginnings must come a just and lasting settlement for Palestinians and Israelis alike – and a reckoningAt last! The yearned for Israel-Hamas ceasefire-for-hostages deal is finally happening. It is welcome. Like thin ice covering deep waters, it is scarily fragile, prone to crack under the slightest pressure. And it is desperately, lethally overdue. Tens of thousands of Palestinians, and many Israelis, have died since last May, when the US president, Joe Biden, first set out the parameters of this agreement. Civilians are still being killed in Israeli airstrikes that have actually intensified since the two sides grudgingly initialled the deal in Qatar.Palestinians in Gaza and elsewhere are naturally relieved that these merciless Israeli bombardments will soon stop. But celebrations are tempered by fears about the future, and by deep grief and anger over the still terrifying present and immediate past. According to Gaza health ministry figures, more than 46,000 people have died there since the 7 October 2023 Hamas terrorist attacks killed over 1,200 people. The true Palestinian death toll may be even higher.Simon Tisdall is the Observer’s foreign affairs commentatorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Memo for Rachel Reeves: regulators cannot produce growth out of thin air | Nils Pratley,"Companies grumble about watchdogs, and there’s often room to improve, but the big stuff is in the hands of government“Every regulator, no matter what sector, has a part to play by tearing down the regulatory barriers that hold back growth,” said Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, after summoning the overseers of the railways, aviation, water and energy industries and more for a pow-wow at No 11. You’d almost think the UK would be transformed into a high-growth paradise if only these regulatory plodders would allow companies to embrace risk-taking.The reality, sadly, is more nuanced. First, most of these regulators – the likes of the Competition and Markets Authority, Ofcom, Ofwat, Ofgem, the Environment Agency and the Civil Aviation Authority – have had a secondary “growth duty” since 2017. The political urging to take the obligation more seriously may be louder these days, but the duties themselves have not changed. Continue reading...","Thu, 16 Jan 2025 18:40:09 GMT",-0.2924,0.936
The Guardian,"At Davos, Trump will face a less friendly brand of billionaire – but their dominance is waning | Larry Elliott","These high priests of globalisation are facing the fact that Trump’s tariffs are part of a global shift to protectionismHollywood would struggle to come up with a better plot. On Monday, as Donald Trump returns to the White House, the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) annual talk fest kicks off in Davos. The arch protectionist v the spiritual home of globalisation. The man who says “tariff” is “the most beautiful word in the dictionary” being sworn in for a second term just as the high priests of free trade assemble 5,000ft up in the Swiss Alps.The Davos elite have a love-hate relationship with Trump: they despise him, but when he showed up at the WEF as president he was the hottest ticket in town. This year, the billionaires will have to make do with a video link appearance, but even from the other side of the Atlantic, Trump will dominate events. That’s not surprising. Most of the WEF attenders have grown up believing that trade barriers should be torn down, not erected.

The Guardian,Liz Truss is long gone from Downing Street – but zombie economics lives on | Aditya Chakrabortty,"Labour’s panicked reaction to turbulence is to promise ‘ruthless’ cuts. It has learned the wrong lessons from Britain’s shortest-lived PMBritain’s centre of power is stalked by a zombie. Across Westminster, the mere mention of her name summons up a grim past, but she remains ever present: blond bob, eyes that never move and a grin slightly aslant so it expresses not mirth, but faint menace. When least expected, she can bark a laugh that sends shivers up a cabinet minister’s spine. And whenever her shadow looms in SW1, the dread murmur starts: she used to be prime minister, you know.Liz Truss’s stint at the top of politics ended years ago. Perhaps close confidants and trained medics are yet to break the news, but for her, power is a fading memory, a shrinking image in the rear-view. As the voters of South West Norfolk ensured last July, she is now an ex-politician. Yet in British political culture, she is the great undead. No other prime minister since the Brexit vote so haunts current debates. It’s not just because she never belts up, never stops chuntering about how the Guardian and the BBC must be “fixed”, or siccing her lawyers on Keir Starmer. It’s also because her few days of mayhem at No 10 remains the pre-eminent cautionary tale of our times.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Thu, 16 Jan 2025 06:00:01 GMT",0.0,-0.8071
The Guardian,"The Guardian view on Keir Starmer’s economy: no acute crisis, but chronically weak | Editorial","Labour should ask the Bank of England if it can do more to boost growthRecent days of market turmoil have elicited some extraordinary responses. The fact that investors are demanding higher rates to lend to the UK government apparently puts this Labour government in the same position as Liz Truss in 2022, according to some Labour MPs, or as Denis Healey facing the International Monetary Fund in 1976. Others dub the UK’s current position as stagflation, a term redolent of the 1970s, with their stagnant economy and runaway inflation. 
 The problem with these comparisons is that the latest raft of key economic figures do not bear them out – not quite. The first bit about the stagnant economy is broadly correct: over the three months to November, GDP did not rise at all. But inflation isn’t running away. Indeed, at 2.5%, it’s just above the Bank of England’s target and, crucially, price pressures, both in the service sector and stripping out food and energy, have abated. Seen against these numbers, Sir Keir Starmer isn’t facing an acute domestic crisis. Instead, the UK economy just looks chronically weak.Since the banking crash of 2008 and its long, austere&nbsp;aftermath, the UK economy has enjoyed tepid growth at best. After the pandemic, inflation surged around the world. Prices remain high, fuelling&nbsp;discontent against many governments and helping to usher in Donald Trump. But they are no longer rising at the same rate. Continue reading...","Thu, 16 Jan 2025 18:35:06 GMT",-0.5111,0.4748
The Guardian,The Guardian view on Biden’s warning of oligarchy: Trump and the malefactors of wealth | Editorial,"The outgoing president was right, in his farewell address, to warn of the dangers posed by the billionaires around the tableAristocrats are “the most difficult Animals to manage, of anything in the whole Theory and practice of Government. They will not suffer themselves to be governed,” John Adams warned, writing after his presidency. Banning titles was insufficient; a few would still be distinguished by birth or, especially, wealth. The problem was not just their ability to buy political favours but the grip that their money had on people’s minds.Economic and political power entwine everywhere. Fear of the rich’s outsized influence has existed throughout US history. Yet at times the relationship becomes especially stark and threatening. On Wednesday, Joe Biden evoked the 19th-century Gilded Age and the robber barons – who crushed competitors, exploited workers, bought judges and politicians, and flaunted wealth – in his warning against oligarchs.

The Guardian,Are the young really so down on democracy? | Letters,"The trend for young people to express support for ‘strongmen’ dictators is alarming but seems to be waning, writes Dr Craig Reeves, while Derrick Joad says democracy has failed them and Jane Ghosh is glad she won’t be around for a 1930s rerunIt’s naturally concerning that a recent poll on which you report (13 January), and which Owen Jones refers to (Young people are abandoning democracy for dictators. I can understand their despair, 14 January), suggests that one in five young Britons would prefer an unelected dictator to democracy. However, comparing this with a 2022 poll gives rise to a more optimistic view: that among young Britons, support for unelected dictators appears to be falling, while support for democracy appears to be modestly increasing.In the 2022 poll, by the thinktank Onward, only 72% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 76% of 25- to 34-year-olds agreed that democracy is a fairly or very good system of government (as against 94% of those aged 65-plus), while an astonishing 60% of 18- to 44-year-olds agreed that “a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections” is a fairly or very good system of government (as against 27% of those aged 65-plus). That poll didn’t ask respondents to choose between democracy and dictatorship, so comparison requires caution, but on any view the generation gap on support for democracy and dictatorship is not new, and the appeal of unelected dictatorship among the young appears to be on the wane.

The Guardian,"Boys, gangs and the pressure to ‘be a man’ | Letters","Following the killing of 14-year-old Kelyan Bokassa, Alison Verney and Angela Raven-Roberts write about the pressures being experienced by young boysI totally agree with Gaby Hinsliff (Loved ones mourn Kelyan Bokassa, the 14-year-old boy killed on a London bus. And we all have some thinking to do, 10 January). In my professional life, for 40 years or so I mainly taught secondary pupils, mostly in and around London. Looking back on my varied career, my favourite job was teaching boys. I observed that they bumble along the road to maturity and sexuality. In an all-boys’ environment, they find their own way to adulthood.There are so many pressures on young people, and “being a man” is one that is foisted on boys earlier and earlier. Being their “own man” and being part of a gang with power and influence – as well as having access to material possessions – must be a seductive lure to them.

The Guardian,Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend,"Newcastle chase a perfect 10, Chelsea seek a reliable No 9 and Southampton just want to get beyond sixIf Arsenal’s books for the January window look closed, a meeting with Aston Villa casts forward thoughts to summer business. During Wednesday’s north London derby it was not difficult to wonder how much greater the margin of victory might have been with either Ollie Watkins or Jhon Durán leading the Gunners frontline. If Martin Zubimendi is an expected summer arrival, adding to an already packed midfield, where does a forward come in? Gabriel Jesus’s knee injury delays his possible sale while increasing the need for reinforcements. Villa have been busy, with Donyell Malen coming in from Dortmund and Jaden Philogene sold to Ipswich. Monchi, Villa’s president of football operations, has never been shy of selling players to bring in further talent. Watkins, who is 29, was on the mark at Everton for his first goal of 2025. Duran, 21, unused at Goodison after suspension, may be Arsenal’s next-best option to the imperious, and probably far too expensive, Alexander Isak.

The Guardian,‘Criminally reckless’: why LA’s urban sprawl made wildfires inevitable – and how it should rebuild,"A century of foolhardy development, including public subsidies for rebuilding in the firebelt, hugely contributed to this tragedy, writes our architecture critic. LA must rethink – and build upwards not outwards‘Crime don’t climb” is one of the glib mottoes long used by Los Angeles real estate agents to help sell the multimillion dollar homes in the hills that surround the sprawling metropolis. Residents of the lush ridges and winding canyons can rest assured, in their elevated green perches – safely removed from the smog-laden, supposedly crime-ridden flatlands beneath. What the realtors neglect to mention, however, is that, while crime rarely ascends the hills, flames certainly do. And that the very things that make this sun-soaked city’s dream homes so attractive – lush landscaping, quaint timber construction, raised terrain and narrow, twisting lanes – are the very things that make them burn so well. They create blazing infernos that, as we have seen over the past week, are tragically difficult to extinguish.LA’s ferocious wildfires have seen an area about three times the size of Manhattan incinerated. At least 12,000 homes have burned to the ground and 150,000 people have been evacuated, as entire neighbourhoods become smouldering ruins. Twenty-five people have died, 24 more are missing. Estimates suggest the cost of damage and economic losses could reach $250bn, making it the costliest wildfire in US history – mainly due to the flames torching some of the highest-value real estate in the country. And it’s not over yet. The city is bracing for further destruction, as weather forecasts suggest winds might pick up again. Continue reading...","Wed, 15 Jan 2025 16:49:04 GMT",0.0,-0.9692

The Guardian,‘The ghosts are everywhere’: can the British Museum survive its omni-crisis?,"Beset by colonial controversy, difficult finances and the discovery of a thief on the inside, Britain’s No 1 museum is in deep trouble. Can it restore its reputation?The British Museum is everybody’s idea of a museum, but at the same time, it is hardly like a museum at all. It is more like a little state. The rooms you visit on a day out are the least of it: the museum is not the contents of its display cases. It is an embassy, a university, a police station, a science lab, a customs house, a base for archaeological excavations, a place of asylum, a retail business, a publisher, a morgue, a detective agency. “We’re not a warehouse, [or] a mausoleum,” its chair, the UK’s former chancellor George Osborne, told guests at the museum’s annual trustees’ dinner in November. On the contrary, it is both these things, and others beside.It is a sprawling, chaotic reflection of Britain’s psyche over 300 years: its voracious curiosity and cultural relativism; its pugnacious superiority complex; its restless seafaring and trading; its cruel imperial enrichment; its brilliant scholarship, its brutality, its idealism, its postcolonial anxiety. All of this is expressed through the amassing of objects: a demented accumulation, a mania for hoarding that, in any human, would be regarded as a kind of illness. The museum contains, in total, 8m objects. Or maybe 6m, depending on how you count them. (A collection of 1m cigarette cards bequeathed in 2006 is counted as a single item, for instance.) Either way, the collection is vast and grows every year. Add together everything owned by the Louvre, the National Gallery and the V&amp;A, and you still have fewer than half the objects possessed by the British Museum.

So, how was it that I spent a large portion of my 20s​­ terrified of the big, long life I had before me? After Stanford University, I’d moved to New York to work at Google but I was depressed, anxious.When I realised that many brilliant and accomplished people were also secretly miserable, just trying to make it through the day, I looked for terminology to describe this, but there was none. So I came up with my own: the underfulfilled overachiever, or UFOA. This describes a constant striver who is living a great‑­on‑­paper life, yet feels disconnected from their work, life and self. UFOAs see success as the organising principle of our lives. We call it by a catchy name: hustle culture. We brag about our intense busyness. Side hustles are a badge of honour.

The Guardian,Wake-up call: six ways to change your attitude to insomnia,"Waking up at night is natural and even beneficial, so we should embrace insomnia and learn to enjoy itSleep: we know it feels good, we know it’s necessary. But the deluge of guidance, whether from well-meaning sleep scientists or bio-hackers on TikTok, has made falling asleep more fraught than ever. We are now instructed to sleep for seven to eight hours in an undisturbed stretch, with perfectly proportioned REM and Non-REM sleep. We are encouraged to track, count and monitor to achieve perfect sleep. We are told that failing to sleep well raises our risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s, obesity, depression and death. Little wonder so many of us (37% according to the Sleep Charity) are struggling to sleep. And little wonder that today’s anxiety-fuelled sleep industry is worth a staggering $585bn.For anyone suffering from less-than-perfect slumber, being constantly reminded that sleep is our superpower has done little more than amplify our sleep anxiety. I was one of these. So when a series of bereavements sent my mild insomnia into overdrive, I took the advice of a sleep scientist who suggested I treat it as a luxurious gift of extra time. Viewed like this, my sleepless nights became a chance to metaphorically travel through new lands, and no longer a “condition” that threatened to kill me.

The Guardian,‘Women are the best to women’: has Iceland found the antidote to toxic ‘girlboss’ feminism?,"Fifty years ago, Icelandic women went on strike, kickstarting a gender revolution. Today, the concept of ‘konur eru konum bestar’ is everywhere – including the female-led coalition governmentWalking in steady procession, mittened hand in mittened hand, we descend in our swimsuits into the icy cold North Atlantic Ocean, singing. Usually the women sing an Icelandic song as they enter the waves, but this Saturday, for my benefit, they have chosen to sing You Are My Sunshine first. It’s 11am but the sun is only just rising, the ocean waves lapping and the sky shades of pink and purple. The big black rock in the middle of Reykjavík’s Skarfaklettur beach is dusted in snow. The water is apparently around zero degrees. When we are about waist high, my thighs go numb and the chain of hands breaks up. For a second I feel alone as I start to lose my breath and the others disappear into the water. But then Guðrún Tinna Thorlacius, known as Tinna, arrives to ask if I am OK. She looks at me with such sincerity and care that I cannot help but feel held. We breathe in for a count of three and out for another six, until I am ready to descend to my chest. 
 Members of the multigenerational ocean dipping group, Glaðari Þú (Happier You), meet several times a week at different spots around the Icelandic capital. I am here because it encapsulates a uniquely Icelandic idea – konur eru konum bestar (women are the best to women) – that has gained popularity in recent years as a guiding principle for how women should treat one another. 
 The phrase, created by women, is a contemporary inversion of an old saying – konur eru konum verstar (women are the worst to women). The idea is that rather than imitating the patriarchy by behaving in ways that make life worse for other women, they instead choose to uplift and support one another. It feels especially resonant in an age of polarisation and social media-fuelled comparison, where feminism, toxicity and exclusion have a tendency to get mixed up – to the extent that some interpretations of feminism can feel regressive. Could konur eru konum bestar be the Icelandic antidote to toxic “girlboss” culture?Including Tinna, who co-runs the ocean-dipping sessions, there are 19 of us in today’s group. I attend with Þorgerður Jóhannsdóttir and Helga Gunnarsdóttir, who are ocean-dipping addicts. For four years they have been doing this three or four times a week. This year, they both turn 70. While the group is theoretically unisex, they mostly attract women, with their fun, playful sessions aimed at seeking the natural high that comes with plunging into the cold ocean. The meeting starts with a warmup and group meditation, huddled together in a circle on the beach, and ends with dancing and singing. The middle bit, when we go into the ocean, is short but unforgettable. Some women put their heads underwater, others do a few press-ups afterwards. When we emerge back on to the beach, our movements seem freer, inhibitions lighter and the mood brighter. “We have two boyfriends,” says Tinna, as she starts up the post-dip music: first playing Harry Belafonte’s Jump in the Line, then Via Con Me by Paolo Conte, both of which the group dances to in sync. As I try to copy their moves, the words “It’s wonderful, it’s wonderful, it’s wonderful / Good luck my baby!” being belted out with gleeful abandon around me, it is impossible not to feel communal joy.
