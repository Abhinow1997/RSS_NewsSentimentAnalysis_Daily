The Guardian,"Ukraine war briefing: Don’t let Patriot missile systems gather dust, says Zelenskyy, after deadly strike on clinic","President calls for more air defence systems from allies, and blames Russia for drone hitting nuclear inspectors’ car. What we know on day 1,022See all our Ukraine war coverageVolodymyr Zelenskyy has urged Ukraine’s allies to provide 10-12 more Patriot air defence systems that he said would fully protect its skies, after a Russian missile killed at least four people in the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia. The attack destroyed a private clinic and injuring 20 more people, including a child. “We repeat again and again that air defences should save lives, not gather dust at storage bases,” Ukraine’s president said.In Zaporizhzhia, rescuers worked in piles of rubble from the collapsed building where at least six people were trapped, the regional governor, Ivan Fedorov, said on the Telegram messaging app. Anna Zubchenko, a 26-year-old ophthalmologist, was working in her office when the attack happened. “The ceiling just collapsed onto my head. Another doctor was with me, she was hit harder. Once I dug myself out I started shouting ‘please help’,” Zubchenko said. She helped to partially dig out her colleague who was later evacuated by rescuers.The US has disbursed a $20bn loan for Ukraine backed by proceeds earned on frozen Russian assets, as part of a $50bn G7 support package. Zelenskyy said he was “deeply grateful” for the disbursement, calling it “a powerful act of justice”. The US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, called it a “critical infusion of support as [Ukraine] defends its country against an unprovoked war of aggression”. Donald Trump, who will become US president in January, has said he will “probably” reduce aid to Kyiv.On Tuesday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said a drone attack had severely damaged its official vehicle heading to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in a Russian-occupied part of the region. No one was injured and workers were safe, said the agency’s chief, Rafael Grossi. Zelenskyy said the drone was Russian. There was no immediate comment from Moscow.The US state department has approved the potential sale to Ukraine of F-16 sustainment services and related equipment for $266m, the Pentagon said on Tuesday. The principal contractors will be Sabena, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics and Pratt and Whitney, the Pentagon said in a statement.Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said peace talks on ending Russia’s war in Ukraine could begin this winter. Poland is a staunch backer of neighbouring Ukraine and next month will take over the rotating EU presidency. Tusk also announced a series of upcoming talks with foreign officials. “Our [EU] presidency will notably be co-responsible for what the political landscape will look like, perhaps how the situation will look during [peace] negotiations, which could begin – though there are still question marks – in the winter of this year.” Continue reading...","Wed, 11 Dec 2024 00:27:40 GMT",-0.6597,-0.9321

The Guardian,Exceedingly good needle drops: why a 1915 Kipling poem is the cherry on top of the 28 Years Later trailer,"Zombie movie action soundtracked by the unhinged vinyl screeches of Boots, Rudyard Kipling’s evocation of soldiers in battle? It’s a match made in horror movie heavenIf you’re honest with yourself, you probably weren’t all that excited about 28 Years Later when you first heard about it. After all, as entertaining as 2002’s 28 Days Later was, 2007’s 28 Weeks Later demonstrated all the signs of diminishing returns. It wasn’t as scary. It wasn’t as memorable. And it turns out that things just weren’t as interesting six months after a zombie outbreak as they were four weeks after. By rights, 28 Years Later should continue this trend. And, when it comes out, that might still prove to be the case. As of now, though, it’s just about the most exciting film of 2025. And this is entirely down to its trailer.By now, you know the basic formula for most movie trailers. Pick any song from the last 50 years, doesn’t matter which, and record a new version of it. The first half of it should be dreamy and distant, the second punctuated with big echoey drums that cut well with the action. Just recently, the Minecraft Movie trailer did this with Magical Mystery Tour, Babygirl did it with Madison Beer’s Make You Mine and even A Complete Unknown managed to find a way to shoehorn giant drum noises into Like a Rolling Stone.

The Guardian,A Complete Unknown review – Timothée Chalamet’s Bob Dylan is an electric revelation,"James Mangold’s biopic follows the rise of the era-defining star with Chalamet brilliantly embodying his shapeshifting allureNot Judas – Jesus. Timothée Chalamet’s hilarious and seductive portrayal of Bob Dylan makes him the smirking, scowling and unwilling leader of his generation, whose refusal to submit to the crucifixion of folk-acoustic purity is his own crucifixion. Chalamet gives us a semi-serious ordeal of someone who is part Steinbeck hero, part boyband star, part sacrificial deity. On being derisively asked if he is God, Chalamet’s Dylan replies: “How many more times? Yes.” Chalamet shows us the mysterious burden of celebrity and zeitgeist-ownership endured by a singer-songwriter who transcends John the Baptist (in the form of fatherly and sad-eyed folk mentor Pete Seeger – wonderfully played by Edward Norton) and finally has to wake up his dozing Apostles in Garden of Gethsemane with electric guitars played, in his legendary words, “fuckin’ loud”.James Mangold’s biopic, co-scripted by him and Jay Cocks, is based on Elijah Wald’s 2015 book Dylan Goes Electric! Newport, Seeger, Dylan and the Night That Split the Sixties; it’s the story of Dylan’s musical and personal adventures in the first half of the decade as he electrified the world of folk in every sense. He was carried onwards and upwards by the folk movement appreciative of his poetic talent, but dissatisfied with what he saw as folk’s regressive, museum-oriented placidity (and Dylan is shown here not engaging explicitly with its socialist traditions); he is yearning for the new modern energy of rock’n’roll as the musical form which he has to master if it is not to surpass him.

The Guardian,Comfort and joy! Merry gentlemen Sheeps deliver the ultimate Christmas album,"With A Very Sheeps Christmas, featuring songs such as Hoo Hoo Daddy X, the comic trio and guests including Rose Matafeo pastiche all manner of festive tunesAre any two forms of artistic expression more widely maligned than musical comedy and the Christmas album? It would take a talent of Santa’s-sack proportions, surely, to redeem both at once. Step forward the gadfly sketch trio Sheeps, who have released their maiden (and I think we can assume, only) festive album, A Very Sheeps Christmas. The “musical passion project” of Sheeps’ Daran Johnson and Al Roberts, and supposedly 10 years in the making, it features 20 original tracks and guest vocal appearances by fellow Sheep Liam Williams alongside comedy megastars Rose (Starstruck) Matafeo, Lolly (Ghosts) Adefope, Jamie (Stath Lets Flats) Demetriou and more. Oh, and it’s very funny indeed.A good way to experience it would be at one of the trio’s three live gigs this month that launch the album: my enjoyment of it was greatly intensified by familiarity with Sheeps as live performers. On record as on stage, the joke when Liam Williams opens his lungs to sing is that such a gruff and deadpan man should be going all light entertainment in the first place. But Johnson and Roberts take more of the strain here, with a suite of songs of sometimes sublime silliness – lyrically, conceptually and vocally too, whether that’s Roberts’ high-pitched Prince stylings in the sexy-Santa number Hoo Hoo Daddy X or giving it sinister little yelps in the death-worshipping country-and-western carol (“that baby’s gonna die for me”) No Room at the Inn.Sheeps are at Moth Club, London, 16-18 December.

The Guardian,"Memo to the Assads: Putin may welcome you in Moscow, but I wouldn't drink his tea | Marina Hyde","The Russian leader may be a warm and attentive host: he may also be cross that Assad is now his problem. But then life’s full of uncertainty, isn’t it? It’s fair to say the TV show Schitt’s Creek would have been a lot less funny had it concerned the family of a deposed dictator rather than the family of an embezzled video store mogul. Even so, it’s a strange but undeniable fact that when toddlers are stumbling out of dungeons, and the unspeakable horrors of the former Syrian regime are still being revealed, a significant part of the human impulse is to thirst for details of the dreadful Assad family’s new lives in Moscow, then remark tartly: “Well, they’ve gone down in the world.” And of course, the Assads may yet plunge further – for all the overly impressed reports of apartments in glittering Moscow skyscrapers, I must say I’d have picked something on the ground floor myself.For now, Syrian refugee Bashar al-Assad might be telling himself that if Vladimir Putin has offered him asylum, he can’t possibly be angry with him for putting Russia’s unrivalled network of military bases in Syria at serious risk. In which case, it’s possible Bashar is about to go on a journey of discovery as long as the Trans-Siberian railway. Then again, it could be much, much shorter. But perhaps Assad’s comfortable with limbo. He has, after all, spent the past two decades apparently unable to decide whether he is or isn’t growing a moustache. Follically speaking, I guess he now finally has time to pick a lane. Or, as I say, doesn’t have time. For while the man who used chemical weapons against his own people may be physically located in Moscow, in security terms, and for the rest of his entire life, he cannot be at all clear where he stands.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Some time in the early hours of Saturday, as Storm Darragh blasted through our bit of rural Oxfordshire, the power lines had come down; by the time the central heating would otherwise have been firing up, the house was decidedly arctic.The novelty of lighting candles, chopping firewood and making coffee on a sputtering camping stove carried everyone through the first few hours.

By early evening there wasn’t much to do except agree that obviously we have it easy compared with Ukraine – now in its third icy winter of Russia using attacks on domestic power infrastructure as an extra weapon of war, which puts this minor domestic inconvenience into perspective – and that our digitised lives have become quite madly, recklessly vulnerable to a sudden loss of power.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Tue, 10 Dec 2024 10:00:18 GMT",-0.6249,-0.9358
The Guardian,"Jubilation, gunfire, mourning – on the streets of Damascus, Syrians are facing the reality of life after Assad | Danny Makki","As I spoke to locals, the mood was one of relief – but there are countless tales of loved ones who are not here to help celebrateIn the end, there was no great battle for Damascus, no gruelling siege of the kind we have become accustomed to in Syria’s brutal 13-year civil war. It was just an army that melted away and a fleeing president that brought the more than 50-year-long Baathist dictatorship to an end.As Syrians continue to gather to celebrate around Umayyad Square, a new dawn in the country has begun. Further challenges are to come, but for the time being, Syrians can breathe easier. I am a Damascus-based journalist who has been speaking to people on the ground in Syria’s freed capital city as they grapple with their new reality.

The Guardian,Who’s the most basic person on the internet? A court will have to decide between these two beige influencers | Arwa Mahdawi,"Sydney Nicole Gifford has accused rival Alyssa Sheil of copying her bland style, in a $150,000 lawsuit over lost income and ‘mental anguish’. What’s behind this race to the bottom?Sydney Nicole Gifford, a 24-year-old lifestyle influencer, was busy being her most authentic self when her carefully curated world suddenly shattered. One of her followers had contacted her with terrible news: someone had stolen her vibe.What does this even mean? Well, that’s the question at play in what may be the saddest, beigest (and possibly most important) lawsuit in influencer history. Gifford, you see, is aggressively fond of neutrals. She likes wearing shades of white, black and cream, and lives in an incredibly organised house where her minimalist decor is also shades of white, black and cream. She reviews Amazon products that fit what is known as the “clean girl” aesthetic and, when her followers buy stuff from her affiliate links, she makes a commission from the sale.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"Video is AI’s new frontier – and it is so persuasive, we should all be worried | Victoria Turk","I tried Sora, OpenAI’s new tool, and it just left me sad. Are we ready for a world in which we can never tell what is real?I recently had the opportunity to see a demo of Sora, OpenAI’s video generation tool which was released in the US on Monday, and it was so impressive it made me worried for the future. The new technology works like an AI text or image generator: write a prompt, and it produces a short video clip. In the pre-launch demo I was shown, an OpenAI representative asked the tool to create footage of a tree frog in the Amazon, in the style of a nature documentary. The result was uncannily realistic, with aerial camera shots swooping down on to the rainforest, before settling on a closeup of the frog. The animal looked as vivid and real as any nature documentary subject.Yet despite the technological feat, as I watched the tree frog I felt less amazed than sad. It certainly looked the part, but we all knew that what we were seeing wasn’t real. The tree frog, the branch it clung to, the rainforest it lived in: none of these things existed, and they never had. The scene, although visually impressive, was hollow.Victoria Turk is a London-based journalist covering technology, culture and society Continue reading...","Tue, 10 Dec 2024 14:55:35 GMT",-0.296,0.8874
The Guardian,The latest cost of Brexit is about to hit – and voters are watching. Will Labour act? | Polly Toynbee,"New EU trade regulations will cause further pain for the UK. Starmer’s talk of breaking down barriers must be more than warm words“It’s done! Get over it! It’s eight years ago! We’re independent and we’re free!” claimed Nigel Farage on Question Time last week. But the louder he asserted it, the less convinced he sounded. Watch the Brexit that made him becoming an albatross, as it is for the Tories.This week’s new set of EU trade regulations hammering Britain’s smaller exporters is proof that it isn’t over, but forever adding to our economic woes. From Thursday, general product safety regulations (GPSR) will apply to a huge new range of products. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) warns: “The GPSR will be a real barrier to trade.” Exporters will need an agent within the EU or Northern Ireland, costing at least €150 an item a year. “I only found out when eBay said they’d only take GPSR products from this week,” says Noel Humphrey. His company, Electron Electronics, manufactures, sells and trades in small electrical parts. “It will cost me an extra £25 for each soldering iron I sell. If we were still in the EU, this would be no problem,” he says. “And we’d be at the table that makes these rules.” Electron may give up exporting.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Tue, 10 Dec 2024 06:00:35 GMT",0.0,0.4797
The Guardian,‘Loaded for bear’? Online puzzles are puzzling enough without all this American lingo | Zoe Williams,"I’ve been doing Wordle-style games for so long that I’ve assimilated US spellings and phrases. Honestly, it’s enough to make you a Monday morning quarterbackTake our UK v US spelling quiz!When Wordle first landed, more than three years ago, a lot of Britons complained, bitterly, about the American spellings, taking to social media to rage that there was no such word as “favor” and what fresh illiteracy was this? Very gradually, we just adapted. They had to choose one dictionary; who says it had to be ours? Especially given that Wordle is now owned by the New York Times.Nowadays, I deliberately forget how to spell “colour” – not just for Wordle, but also for Quordle (which is basically four Wordles at once) – so often that I have given up even wishing for something different. But then I added the NYT’s Connections (a grid of 16 words that you have to sort into four categories) to my morning puzzling roster. Never mind the spellings – now I have to look up American types of cracker, women’s national basketball teams, slang terms for “loo”. Continue reading...","Tue, 10 Dec 2024 11:00:11 GMT",0.0,-0.6251
The Guardian,The Guardian view on Trump’s threat to the media: time to pass the Press Act,"Bipartisan legislation offers historic protections for journalists, banning secret surveillance and ensuring source confidentialityFears of a press crackdown under Donald Trump’s second term deepened with his nomination of Kash Patel as FBI director – given his calls for retribution against journalists. Yet a rare chance to protect press freedom has emerged. The bipartisan Protect Reporters from Exploitative State Spying (Press) Act, the strongest press freedom legislation in US history, is on the brink of a vote. While President-elect Trump has urged Republicans to block it, the Senate could still deliver it to Joe Biden before the lame-duck session ends in January.The Press Act would ban secret government demands for journalists’ communications from tech giants such as Google or Verizon and protect reporters from jail for refusing to reveal sources. For investigative reporters to do their jobs – holding government officials to account for corruption and wrongdoing – they need to be able to protect the confidentiality of their sources. With courts recently weakening already-imperilled “reporter’s privilege” protections, this bill would finally give journalists in the US federal protections comparable to those afforded to other relationships where confidentiality is paramount, such as lawyers and clients, doctors and patients, and spouses.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on the EU-Mercosur trade deal: another farmer flashpoint approaches | Letters,"Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, has taken a political risk in signing off an agreement with Latin American countriesAnticipating the strong protectionist winds that will blow from Donald Trump’s White House, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has been responding by making her own economic weather. Last week, Ms von der Leyen flew&nbsp;to&nbsp;Montevideo, 5,000 miles south of Washington DC, to controversially conclude negotiations in one&nbsp;of&nbsp;the biggest free trade agreements in history. Twenty-five years in the making, the Mercosur trade deal opens&nbsp;up trade between the EU and a Latin&nbsp;American bloc of partners comprising Argentina,&nbsp;Brazil, Paraguay&nbsp;and Uruguay.In theory, the agreement promises a more open market of 700 million people for products ranging from Argentine beef to German cars. For European manufacturers, it would eliminate tariffs on a majority&nbsp;of goods. As Mr Trump threatens to impose heavy tariffs on Chinese and European exports, here was evidence, asserted Ms von der Leyen, “that openness and cooperation are the true engines of progress and prosperity”.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Men must be held accountable for their bad behaviour | Letters,"Readers respond to Mary Ann Sieghart’s piece on why some men behave badly following revelations about the TV presenter Gregg WallaceMary Ann Sieghart (Why do some men behave badly? I think I have the answer, 6 December) argues that one of the main reasons why some men behave inappropriately is because of a power imbalance. She cites research evidence that a sense of male superiority and entitlement starts early – in parental attitudes and teacher behaviour. I found her arguments partly, but not totally, convincing. The studies she cites about gender socialisation and classroom interaction have been around since the 1980s (eg&nbsp;Dale&nbsp;Spender and Elizabeth Sarah’s Learning to Lose: Sexism and Education, 1980), including my own research. It’s pretty depressing that little has changed since then.But while these findings may help to explain why many women still face problems in career progression – and why women in junior positions may hesitate to highlight men’s sexist behaviour – I&nbsp;don’t think they explain why some men engage in outrageous sexual&nbsp;harassment.

The Guardian,Slot unhappy despite Salah sinking Girona to make it a perfect six for Liverpool,"Liverpool’s perfect Champions League continued and a new record was completed with a sixth win and a fifth clean sheet. Arne Slot’s side have now not conceded since the third minute of the opening night at San Siro, their best ever run in Europe. They also have their goalkeeper back, and on a cold night at Montilivi those things were related. Mohamed Salah’s penalty secured a 1-0 victory against Girona, but this was also about Alisson who made five saves on his return to help virtually secure a place in the last 16 with two matches to spare.If the record is perfect, the performance was not. “If you ask me about all the six games, I’m really pleased with all the results,” he said. “I’m really pleased with the five games, the way we played.

The Guardian,Ross Barkley’s lucky break edges Aston Villa past Leipzig in five-goal thriller,"After Jhon Durán scored, with another ludicrously powerful strike, he celebrated by showing the Aston Villa supporters the palms of his hands, as if to say: “Calm down, what else did you possibly expect?” Perhaps it explains why Unai Emery, hands in the pockets of his long black puffer coat, was unmoved. Another substitute, Ross Barkley, ultimately earned victory with stoppage time looming, however, after RB Leipzig twice pegged Villa back, Loïs Openda and Christoph Baumgartner cancelling out goals by John McGinn and that dreamy strike from Durán.Villa supporters crooned Emery’s name throughout and his changes proved inspired. Durán made another timely contribution and Barkley scored within two minutes of replacing Youri Tielemans. Barkley took aim from the edge of the box and his right-foot shot took a wicked deflection off the Germany defender Lukas Klostermann, wrongfooting the goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi, to push Villa up to third. With a trip to Monaco and a home game against Celtic remaining in the league phase, Villa are in a fine spot to make a play for the top eight.

The Guardian,Bellingham gives Atalanta too much to do as Real Madrid show they are back,"Rumours of Real Madrid’s imminent Champions League demise had, it turns out, been exaggerated. So had suggestions Kylian Mbappé makes a poor fit for Carlo Ancelotti’s side if an emphatic opening goal is anything to go by, although his later departure with an injury means the question marks will linger. Ultimately the holders could feel relieved at hauling themselves back into contention for an automatic knockout spot and the fact Atalanta, intense and vibrant to the last, were cheered off in defeat said everything about the tenor of a pulsating evening.It ended with Mateo Retegui volleying over from point-blank range, although a likely offside spared his blushes. The home side would have deserved to extend a 14-game unbeaten run that stretched to late September. Everyone leaves this rebuilt venue, the most cutting-edge in Italy but still dreamily atmospheric, knowing they have been in a game and Real were taken the distance. Atalanta should still reach the last 16 one way or another and there was a sense, as the teams walked off, that they may meet again soon with more at stake.

Giovanni had a slow-rising smile that emitted warmth, even as she told me, apparently to put me at ease, “Remember, the door is always open, if you don’t like what you’re hearing you can always walk away.”Her poetry emerged from the fire and rage that fuelled the civil rights movement.

The Guardian,Ballet legend Peter Wright: ‘Margot Fonteyn was cold as ice. Rudi Nureyev was a bit of a pain’,"At 98, the choreographer has lost none of his love for dance – or his scathing wit. As his classic Nutcracker is performed again, he talks about grit, the ‘rubbish’ classics and directing a historic duoInstead of the circus, Peter Wright ran away to join the ballet. At 16, he was a student at Bedales boarding school in Hampshire, but was desperate to train to be a dancer, something his disapproving father had no truck with. Wright and a friend absconded to chase their dreams. Their great escape ended in a police cell after they slept in a field for two nights, but the breakout was enough to show Wright’s father just how serious he was about wanting to dance: within the year he was apprenticed to the choreographer Kurt Jooss and at the beginning of an illustrious career.Now 98, he has been a dancer, company director and choreographer, and there are few people who have seen the ins and outs of British ballet up close for as long as Sir Peter has, and who are still playing a part in it. His productions of the major ballet classics – Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty, Giselle, Coppélia – are still regularly staged around the world, especially his Nutcracker, which Birmingham Royal Ballet, the company he established in 1990, is dancing this Christmas.

What this meant in practice was that they made one reality show about how hard they had it, and then they stuttered. The Harry &amp; Meghan show was followed by two forgettable documentaries, one about the Invictus Games and one about some nebulous concept of leadership. At some point in the future there will be a Meghan cookery show that Netflix seems reluctant to show. But before that comes Polo, a show about polo made by Prince Harry, who likes polo.

But, with the support of ActionAid, training in vocational skills, community participation and leadership is helping them advocate for the needs of their communityWhen Anwara fled her home in Myanmar six years ago, the youngest of her three daughters was still only a babe in arms. They were part of a group of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees who crossed the border looking for safety. After walking for several days, they arrived in Cox’s Bazar in south-east Bangladesh, a makeshift settlement that is now home to nearly 1 million Rohingya refugees. Life in the camps is hard, Anwara says. But at least it is providing some security for her family. “When we came from Myanmar, we suffered a lot. We didn’t have any money, shelter or food. Now we have a house to live in and receive food rations every month.”Rohingya refugees are in a precarious situation as they have not been formally granted refugee status, so they’re unable to work and integrate with the community outside the camps. Prospects for their return to Myanmar have continued to decrease as levels of violence have risen across the country. Continue reading...","Fri, 01 Nov 2024 14:05:53 GMT",0.0772,-0.2047

Most were native Ukrainians, while others were third-country nationals who had built a life in Ukraine. For all those fleeing the devastation, it was a time of terror and uncertainty, but for the latter group, it was particularly perilous.“From the very beginning of the war, we were getting information about all kinds of abuses that non-Ukrainian [refugees] were facing in Ukraine while trying to get to Poland,” says activist Jarmiła Rybicka. “At the border on both sides, non-Ukrainians were expelled or sent to the back of the queues.

The Guardian,I’m having the best sex of my life – but I can’t climax until my lover leaves the room,"We are in a close and loving relationship, so neither of us can understand this last inhibitionMy lover and I are in our 70s, have been friends for years and are enjoying the best, most intimate sex of our lives. But I struggle to orgasm in front of him. I wish I could see what other women look like when they do but I’m too scared to search for it on the internet. He is very considerate and when he sees that I am close to an orgasm, he leaves me alone for a few minutes with my vibrator. When he hears me climax, he comes back because he wants to hold me and share it. I’d like to understand what is stopping me from doing it while he is lying next to me or watching. I think it could be because I feel at a disadvantage. Unlike me, he probably has seen other women masturbating and climaxing. We are in a close and loving relationship, so he can’t understand this last inhibition of mine. I hesitate to talk to him about it as I don’t want him to look back at previous partners and compare me with them.You do not have to feel bad about a very normal response. Most of us were taught that masturbation was wrong or “dirty”, and for that reason it is hardly surprising you are now programmed to keep it private. Most of us have developed ideas of what is sexually “normal” from unreliable sources – media, pornography, friends. As a couple you have developed a style that works for you, and that is wonderful.

What’s life like when everything you need is just a stroll away?It’s not often that the worlds of town planning and traffic management become mired in controversy, but in recent years the innocuous concept of the “15-minute city” has sparked outrage in online forums, among cynical politicians and on the streets of British cities such as Oxford. The originator of the concept, urban planner Carlos Moreno, has even received death threats. All of this has hinged on the spurious conspiracy theory that 15-minute cities were part of some shady global population-control agenda, rather than a desire to simply create more pleasant neighbourhoods.If the concept of having all your basic amenities within 15 minutes’ distance was enough to provoke such hostility, what would the conspiracy theorists make of a five-minute city? Fortunately, they have failed to notice that Denmark has already built such a place: Nordhavn, an emerging new neighbourhood of Copenhagen.

Then her foster brother was killed and she started piecing together the dates and places that would prove crucial to solving a string of murdersIn 2009, while her husband and teenage children slept, April Balascio was often wide awake in their home in Jefferson, Ohio, jotting down the small towns she’d lived in as a child and trying to match them to their month and year.This wasn’t as easy as it might sound. Her father had driven them all over the US – Ohio, Georgia, Florida, Arizona, Colorado, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania – in whatever vehicle they had at the time – an RV, a U-Haul truck, a camper, a school bus. They had set up home in farmhouses, mobile homes, tents, a barn. Sometimes Balascio completed a school year in one place; other times she didn’t, because her father would wake them at night, tell them to pack up, then off they’d go, no goodbyes, headed who knows where.

Bashar al-Assad, president since 2000, had crushed the uprisings that started thirteen years ago against his rule, and he had slowly taken back control of most of Syrian territory over the course of a decade-long civil war – the bloodiest conflict of the twenty-first century.

The Guardian,‘It’s about total freedom’: Jeff Wall on his photographs of fallen horse riders and flooded graves,"A new exhibition displays 40 years of work by the artist who stages scenes to painstakingly replicate the images in his mind – and some, he says, are definitely easier than othersJeff Wall has long been championed as the master of slow looking. Back in 1985, the year before he turned 40, the British Columbia-born artist received a tip from a close friend. He had, by that point, published landmark scholarly essays, held professorships and made some seminal images, though not that many. His friend had seen a woman fall off her horse, and thought that was something Wall should photograph. “He said: ‘That kind of looked like a subject you could do,’ and I totally disregarded it because I just wasn’t interested at the time. But, two years ago, it came back to me.”Over the past 40 years, Wall has utilised the speed and precision of photography to make exquisite, arresting works based on furtive moments just like this. Ask him how he decides what to shoot and he’ll likely say he’s not sure. Somehow, a vision bubbles up to the surface of his mind. As the viewer, the work he makes in response demands your stillness.
