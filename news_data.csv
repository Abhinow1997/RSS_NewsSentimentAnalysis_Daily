The Guardian,The Last Musician of Auschwitz review – an exceptionally moving film that will ring in your ears for years,"Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, now 99, escaped death in the concentration camp because she played the cello. As this intelligent, chilling and devastating documentary shows, music proved a curse and a comfortAuschwitz was a site of incomparable horror; people arriving at the concentration camp knew it would be hell on earth. So it was a shock to be greeted by a band playing Mozart’s Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. Was this some kind of breathtakingly sick joke? A demonstration of German cultural superiority? A suggestion that the camp “cannot be that bad”, as one survivor recalls hoping? Or was it a sign, as another remembers thinking, that the Nazis really were “crazy”?The truth was complex and chilling, as Toby Trackman’s exceptionally moving and intelligent documentary goes on to explore. The role of music in the Holocaust might initially seem a somewhat marginal topic. Is the fact there were orchestras at Auschwitz really that important in the grand scheme of things? Yes, as it turns out: because by examining the presence of music in the camp, The Last Musician of Auschwitz is able to give voice to a wealth of ideas about the function, value, inherent ambivalence and weaponisation of art and culture.

The Guardian,Lives Less Ordinary review – is this really a fair view of the British working class?,"Two Temple Place, London On show in one of London’s swankier mansions, this exhibition features some great art – but betrays a clichéd view of what authentic working class expression really isThey’ve certainly picked a surprising venue for it. Lives Less Ordinary, an exhibition that critiques and claims to rectify the representation of British working-class life, occupies the wood-panelled, gothic-windowed mansion Two Temple Place, built in the 1890s as a London pad for millionaire William Waldorf Astor. Photos and paintings of common people are hung around a hall that looks like the grand staircase of the Titanic.It’s a curious sight and even curiouser exhibition. The British working class, says the press release, are seen in art “through the reductive and distorting lens of the middle-class gaze. Working-class subjects have been … stereotyped or sensationalised. Working-class artists have been misinterpreted, pigeonholed, or overlooked altogether”. Which artists are they accusing? Richard Billingham, I suspect, whose photobook Ray’s a Laugh portrays drunken squalor inside the council flat where he grew up, and Martin Parr, whose pictures of seaside life tend to be toe-curling. Yet both are lyrical, memorable artists of real British life. Just not with a sufficiently positive attitude. Continue reading...","Mon, 27 Jan 2025 14:29:05 GMT",0.3774,0.9112

Such banned books, usually branded “pornographic”, typically include African American history, LGBTQ+ friendly children’s books, any book addressing racism in America or classics, such as Toni Morrison’s Beloved, deemed in violation of “Judeo-Christian principles”. One librarian in Texas described how she was forced to lock selected books behind closed doors. “Every book that was on that shelf was like telling a student ‘we want to put you behind locks,’” she says in the film.

Tech titan Ellison is reportedly donating huge sums to the Tony Blair Institute.Before we even get to that question – and it’s a good one – there’s just a tiny adjustment we need to make on political vocabulary.

In the early 2000s, a likely fate for a business built on books, stationery, newspapers, CDs and DVDs looked to be “death by Amazon”. What transpired was a textbook display of pragmatic management.Under Kate Swann, chief executive from 2003 to 2013, WH Smith simply ensured that, however rapidly its sales fell on the high street, it always cut costs harder and replaced declining DVDs and so forth with higher-margin products such as greeting cards. Even as annual revenues dwindled from £1.1bn in 2005 to £600m in 2017, profits on the high street increased – never mind the occasional table-topping appearance in “worst retailer” polls.

Now is the time to mourn them fullyFor the past week, Palestinians in Gaza have been returning to their homes, now mostly reduced to rubble – and to their dead who still lie beneath. It is only now that we will start to get a fuller picture of the true toll of this war – only now that any kind of grieving or mourning can begin, a process that has been physically and emotionally denied to the Palestinians throughout the past 15 months. Once the final tally becomes clear, what will probably emerge is a colossal death toll of children.Already, indications point to it being children that have made up the majority of casualties. UN analysis of verified deaths during a five-month period confirmed that of those who died, 44% were children. Most often, those children were five- to nine-year-olds; 80% of them killed in their own homes. Continue reading...","Mon, 27 Jan 2025 06:00:12 GMT",0.3818,-0.9864
The Guardian,The Guardian view on Labour’s climate plans: they should be central to the party’s purpose | Editorial,"An economic shift raises alarming questions about government vision, priorities and commitment to transformative policies To hear Labour’s economic message, one might wonder if Downing Street has developed an unlikely admiration for Liz Truss. Given its focus on growth through cutting planning regulations, reducing welfare budgets and removing dissenting bureaucrats, some believe Labour is in danger of echoing not just the spirit but the substance of Ms Truss’s brief, ill-fated tenure. For a party that rose to power criticising the Tory right’s ideological misadventures, this shift in tone is striking.Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves may see Labour’s sinking poll ratings as reason to align with their opponents, adopting policies – like curbing legal challenges to planning decisions – few rightwingers would contest. In a speech later this week, Ms Reeves plans to give the go-ahead for a third runway at Heathrow, a divisive choice even within Labour that has earned support from the Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on teachers’ pay: colleges don’t deserve second-class status | Editorial,"College staff deserve a pay rise along with their peers. Widening the gap with schools would be a serious mistakeTeachers at sixth-form colleges in England should not be missing out on the 5.5% pay rise awarded to their colleagues across the state school sector. That up to 4,000 of them will do so, unless the government agrees to fund a backdated increase, is due to the messy patchwork of 16-18 education – with some sixth forms operating as academies and others colleges. It is deeply dismaying that ministers are disregarding the brazen injustice of a rise offered to some teachers but not all.Unless they change course and increase the offer made in December, when they were threatened with a judicial review, the result will be more strikes by the National Education Union (NEU) – and more missed learning for teenagers. The situation is made even more jarring by the emphasis in the children’s wellbeing bill on ensuring a level playing field between schools in England – with academies obliged to follow the national curriculum and pay scales from which they have so far been exempted. There is no good reason why sixth-form colleges should be left out of this wider levelling-up project, with their staff denied the raise granted to other teachers.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,You shouldn’t have to be Prince Harry to win redress from Britain’s press | Letters,"Nathan Sparkes on the importance of press participation in the Leveson system; Lexie Kirkconnell-Kawana on affordable access to justiceYour editorial on Prince Harry’s settlement with News Group Newspapers (The Guardian view on Prince Harry and phone hacking: the ethical issues endure, 22 January) says that press regulation “was reformed post-Leveson, although not exactly as the report recommended”. This is something of an understatement.Indeed, the Leveson inquiry was presented with a blueprint for a complaints body by representatives&nbsp;of the newspapers, which would have allowed the press to continue to control their own regulator. This was known as the “Hunt‑Black plan”, after its proposers, Conservative lords Hunt and Black (the latter is also deputy-chair of the Telegraph Media Group).

The Guardian,Rage against the refs has become the norm but surely we can do better?  | Jonathan Liew,"Myles Lewis-Skelly’s red card for Arsenal against Wolves sparked fury and officials are now under exhausting scrutinyWell, obviously we need to talk about that Myles Lewis‑Skelly red card. Shall we have another look at it? Right there, you can see the point at which Michael Oliver’s ego makes contact with his anti-Arsenal bias. If you roll the tape forward a few seconds, you can see a clear movement of content creator towards webcam. But actually, if you look at it from the next angle, you could argue that under the current interpretation of technocratic surveillance capitalism creeping across many late-democratic western societies, it’s actually six of one and half a dozen of the other, Jeff.Occasionally, and usually by accident, I will find myself in a conversation about referees. I can never keep up with them. Largely this is because most football fans have an uncannily encyclopaedic recall of every referee who has ever slighted them: their name, their home town, the full rap sheet, the exact look on their face when they waved away an appeal for a stonewall penalty at the Hawthorns in 2016. “Yeah, Darren Bond’s always had it in for us,” someone will say, and I can only nod dumbly.

The full-back told the BBC the players “want to go the season unbeaten” after their 1-0 win over Arsenal maintained their undefeated run under Bompastor in the WSL, as they ended the weekend with a seven-point cushion at the top, and nine over third-placed Manchester City. “We’ve never won the Champions League. We’ve got five league titles in a row but [going] unbeaten [would be] unbelievable. We’re on a good road to doing that,” said Bronze. Are these realistic targets? Increasingly, yes. The perfect performances haven’t always been there in the first half of the season, a natural thing given the managerial change in the summer, but they have still won 11 of their 12 games, drawing the other.

The Guardian,Train Dreams review – Joel Edgerton stuns in meditative period drama,"Sundance film festival: The actor gives a subtle and sensitive performance in a quiet, beautifully filmed drama set in early 19th century AmericaThere’s a certain type of movie one comes to expect from Sundance: a spare but beautifully filmed family drama featuring a reticent protagonist in an evocative rural setting, favoring quietness to the point of remoteness such that it doesn’t quite deliver on its emotional potential. At first glance, Train Dreams, starring Joel Edgerton as a devoted family man and isolated loner in the early 19th century logging business, seems like it will fall into the trap of stale airiness. At times it does, too maddeningly fascinated with the experience of rustic isolation and too reliant on the unsaid or assumed. Like fellow Sundance premiere Omaha, Train Dreams compensates for a terse male lead with the grand, rapturously filmed scenery of the US west – in this case, the lush and primordial forests of northern Idaho and Washington.Luckily, one cannot get enough of these beastly woods, so towering and teeming with life, and so rapaciously plundered by the American appetite for industry. At its best, writer/director Clint Bentley and co-writer Greg Kwedar have crafted a gorgeous and poignant film of quiet, bruised life in a fragile place, anchored by a magnificently sensitive and restrained performance from the still-underrated Edgerton.Train Dreams is screening at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution Continue reading...","Tue, 28 Jan 2025 00:21:49 GMT",0.6369,0.9954

Not in dollars or pounds, yen or rupees, but a completely different type of currency. A currency measured in experiences, adventures, lessons learned and stories told. As a social psychologist, I have dedicated my research career to a simple, but universal question: what makes for a good life, and how can we achieve it? For much of human history, we have been presented with two possibilities: pursuing a life of happiness, or a life of meaning. Each of these paths has its benefits and proponents, but decades of psychological research have also revealed their limits.The current cultural conception of happiness, for example, can work against us finding fulfilment. Historically, happiness tended to be defined as the result of “good luck” and “fortune”. Today many expect it to come from individual effort and success. But this, in turn, makes unhappiness and negative emotions such as sadness or anger seem like personal failures. Continue reading...","Mon, 27 Jan 2025 12:30:43 GMT",0.0,0.9803

She was very Felliniesque and looked as if she had stepped out of 8 ½. She was an extremely eccentric character and one day she pulled a knife on another girl who was there. I was fascinated by her, not in a romantic way, but to observe, as a curiosity. At that age, 25, I was still into exploring the world and meeting different people you find fascinating or fall in love with. So in the song I used the analogy of exploring the universe. At the same time, I was exploring other things, but the song is not about drugs. Continue reading...","Mon, 27 Jan 2025 15:10:48 GMT",0.0,0.9572

The Guardian,"The best hot sauces, tasted and rated by Thomasina Miers","Our Mexican food specialist gives us her take on hot sauces from UK supermarkets• ‘An absolute belter’: Grace Dent tests the best extra-chocolatey biscuitsWhat a fun job, tasting hot sauces! I had a great time with my 13-year-old and her Ethiopian pal, who assured me of her skill in this department thanks to the traditionally spicy food her family eats at home.We tasted the sauces on their own and with food. Both are essential: with the first drop, you’re looking for the flavour profile and overall taste; with the second mouthful on food – in our case a margherita pizza – you’re looking for how the heat and flavour of the sauce cut through. The moment the heat from the chillies comes into contact with food, especially carbohydrates and fats, the potency is reduced and the heat is sucked up. If you want a sauce to season food and enhance its flavours, then you need more heat than is obvious, and definitely more heat than when tasting the sauces on their own.

But it’s common to find that a hitherto favourite skin, body, hair or makeup product isn’t keeping you as comfy as it should come winter.

The Guardian,‘Everyone can benefit from handwashing’: how a new device is improving access to hygiene,"Inspired by watching his son playing in the bath, engineer Daigo Ishiyama created a tap that works without the need of running waterWhen Daigo Ishiyama contracted Covid in the spring of 2020, he felt grateful knowing he had the basics in place to keep his family safe. “In the developed world, we tend to take access to water, sanitation, and hygiene for granted,” he says. “But a steep inequity in access means many go without these basic human necessities – I knew I was among the lucky ones.”The global pandemic was a stark reminder that one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of a virus is also one of the most direct: handwashing. But according to Unicef, 25% of the world’s population – about 2 billion people – still do not have access to basic handwashing facilities at home; in some of the least developed countries, it is as high as 75%.

So what have inventors dreamed up?First conceived in the 16th century, the flushing toilet has remained relatively unchanged for more than 400 years. But as urban populations swell and antiquated sewage and water systems groan under the strain, the humble lavatory is long overdue a makeover.It’s understood that about 3.5 billion people worldwide lack safely managed sanitation1, including 420 million people who must still defecate outdoors.

While many of us have the privilege of not having to give it too much thought, the reality is that hygiene is the foundation of how individuals, communities and whole societies function. Inadequate sanitation and hygiene is multifaceted, costing billions for local communities and economies, while crippling opportunities for growth and development across entire regions.‘People must be at the core of the solution’When a small team of engineers including Daigo Ishiyama arrived at a remote village in rural Bangladesh in 2012, these were among some of the challenges they were hoping to solve.

At Dior’s haute couture show in Paris, Lewis Carroll’s feisty heroine got a 21st-century makeover. Imagine Alice, she of Wonderland fame, but in her Charli xcx-inspired Brat era and with a wardrobe handmade by the finest seamstresses in Paris. There you start to get the picture.A snowy white cross-backed lace pinafore dress was worn with a quivering black silk mohican headdress. Alice’s striped stockings were reimagined as lace-up leather gladiator boots. Her frothy skirt became a birdcage crinoline, her girlish ribbons were knotted dog collar-tight at the throat. In the front row, Pamela Anderson smiled beneath a dotted black veil and Venus Williams was resplendent in tightly coiled braids. A fantastical landscape featuring lions in feather headdresses and plants that sprouted eyes as well as blooms was embroidered all over the walls, a stage set in the garden of the Musée Rodin.

I’m surprised I didn’t lose the will to live immediately and simply died on the spot.

The Guardian,The one change that worked: I woke up to my phone alarm – until my wife insisted on a new morning routine,"She was adamant. No alarms, bells or sirens to rouse us. Instead, we ease into the day with classical music and green tea, and it has transformed my outlook on lifeUntil I met my wife, I thought the only way to get up was with an alarm, followed by a swift swing of legs into the cold air, launching myself with force into the morning – an abnegation of anything subtle or sweet, like jumping into icy water. Then Ele came into my life and changed my morning routine. Now I am drawn from deep slumber by a trill of notes, an arpeggio perhaps or some soft chords, as I roll between the last fragments of dream and the day ahead. My wife is adamant: no alarms, no bells, no sirens. Instead, the radio gently rises in volume until some note of whatever is playing rouses me from my dream state into reality.After the trill, one of us creeps downstairs to put on tea and, while the old dog eats her breakfast, arranges the pleasing array of a small, not-too-sweet biscuit or two, a bowl of cut fruit and a huge pot of genmaicha green tea (the fun one with the popped rice in it). Then all three of us pile back into a bed that has had its pillows plumped and duvet smoothed out. And there we sit, sipping tea, eating biscuits, listening to BBC Radio 3.

The small eel-like fish might not seem a likely species to inspire a decades-long fight – but they are the treasured food of one of Britain’s rarest and most threatened seabirds, the puffin, as well as many other UK seabirds and marine species.The celebrations, however, were short-lived.

The Guardian,The best new novelists for 2025,"Welcome to our annual selection of the year’s finest debut novels. We have a proven track record in picking authors that go on to be loved by readers and win awards … from Douglas Stuart and Sally Rooney to Caleb Azumah Nelson and Bonnie Garmus. Here are 2025’s gemsFor the 12th year running, writers and editors on the Observer New Review spent the busy weeks before Christmas immersed in dozens of forthcoming debut novels, seeking out the titles we reckon deserve to be in everyone’s hands over the months ahead. Whatever your taste in fiction, this list gives you a heads-up on the future prize winners, mega-sellers and word-of-mouth hits that change the literary conversation. From Shuggie Bain to Conversations with Friends and The Miniaturist, and from Caleb Azumah Nelson to Bonnie Garmus and Sheena Patel – all found early champions here. Colin Barrett, one of last year’s picks, just won this year’s Nero debut fiction prize, awarded last year to Michael Magee, one of our 2023 picks.
 Our search for the year’s best debut novels only ever has one rule: the writers we choose must live in the UK or Ireland. After that, anything goes. The class of 2025 includes authors whose manuscripts were snapped up before they’d left university, and some who didn’t put pen to paper until a later-life left turn. Some are published by independent presses, others by cash-splashing corporates trumpeting the spoils of multiway bidding wars, television rights already in the bag. There are novels on this list that were written at dawn, through lunch breaks, whenever the nine-to-five allowed, and at least one that was written on the cushion of a six-figure advance – a pressure of its own. Several authors here are already well known for their short story collections. Nothing mattered to us but the novels themselves.
 The strong showing from writers in Ireland and Northern Ireland makes sense when you hear them talk about the subsidised literary magazines and development agencies that helped them grow. Surprise, surprise: arts funding is transformative. Those kinds of fortifying networks exist in Britain too, yet the mood feels more atomised, less collegiate, not least since the White Review – a magazine that broke many new names – ceased to publish after Arts Council cuts in 2023.
 If there’s a theme among this year’s books, it might be care – parent-child relationships recur in a variety of guises – but their style and subject differ as widely as their paths to publication. There’s a dizzyingly transcontinental ecological epic about Hindu nationalism, set everywhere from the Chagos Islands to the Arctic Circle. There’s a spare, slender tale of embattled gay love in 1980s south Wales. There’s a pacy page-turner about escaping coercive control, and a filthy comic romp about an “Islamic State bride” in Iraq (really). And that’s just for starters; we loved every one of these outstanding novels, and we think you will too. Here’s to yet more excellent reading.Anthony CumminsA lot of eco fiction is very worthy. My book has car chases!As a teenager, sex is all-consuming … grotty but still erotic, even romantic – shenanigans in cinemas, shenanigans behind cinemas Continue reading...","Sun, 26 Jan 2025 08:00:43 GMT",0.6369,0.9947

They told Hansford that Marcus Garvey, the revolutionary Jamaican leader who pushed for the unity of Black people and a collective return to Africa, would soon be posthumously pardoned for mail fraud.Hansford dialed in Garvey’s son, Dr Julius Garvey, for a three-way call to break the news to him before it hit the newspaper circuit.
