Ordinary people,"Many powerful voices spoke for and against the bill, but those of constituents had the greatest sway over MPs• Assisted dying vote – latest updatesIt is hard to think of a better MP to take on the cause of assisted dying than Kim Leadbeater. She is energetic, engaging, persuasive and speaks like a normal human being. She has no tribal reputation, so there is no barrier to winning over Conservatives, and she has experience of horrifying personal tragedy: her sister, the MP Jo Cox, was murdered.But it would be wrong to say it was Leadbeater who won this initial push to legalise assisted dying. Under the surface, the most important contribution has been the one made by ordinary people, an experiment in participatory democracy by stealth. In the end, that was what delivered such a comprehensive victory for the change at this stage. Continue reading...","Fri, 29 Nov 2024 15:55:40 GMT",0.0,0.9541

The Guardian,Vote on assisted dying summons ultra-rare Commons sight: intelligent debate | John Crace,"The emotion on display during five hours of heated discussion speaks to the complexity and importance of the bill itselfWho would have guessed? All too often debates in the Commons are partisan affairs, punctuated by jeers and braying. Where reason is superseded by dogma and ill-temper. This was a very different occasion. Parliament on its very best behaviour. Where necessary, people – mostly politely – agreeing to disagree. MPs heard in silence. Some in tears. Even more remarkable was the feeling there was intelligent life on view. The quality of argument was a cut above the average.There again, this was no ordinary debate. Most Fridays, Westminster is a ghost town with MPs back home minding their constituencies. But this was an exception. The day when a private member’s bill to legalise assisted dying for terminally ill people took its first step to becoming law. When some men and women of faith tried to imagine making laws for those of no faith.Taking the Lead by John Crace is published by Little, Brown (£18.99).

The Guardian,‘More brains than brawn’: will the new Captain America be hamstrung by his lack of superpowers?,"Marvel has decided to take Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson right back to the superhero stone age with its latest iteration, in which he will basically have no power at allThere’s a weird thing about superheroes. They tend to be a little bit more intriguing when they actually have superpowers. Yes, there is the odd exception: Batman has managed to navigate a Gotham City filled with supervillains who vacillate between the distinctly non-magical (Penguin, Carmine Falcone) and the utterly bonkers (Poison Ivy, Clayface), without having any powers of his own – unless you count his uncanny ability to weaponise extreme wealth and a voice like he has been gargling gravel. Iron Man may not be filled with radioactive spider venom or gamma rays, but he does develop technology that would make Elon Musk sweat as if he’s just realised his latest rocket is running on Windows Vista.
 Then there’s just about everyone else in the Marvel universe – and they all seem to have some kind of deal going on, whether it be Doctor Strange’s mystical, extra-dimensional shenanigans or Captain Marvel’s cosmic power-ups. Which is why it’s downright weird that the studio has decided to take the new Captain America, Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson, right back to the superhero stone age with its latest iteration.The forthcoming Captain America: Brave New World will see Wilson attempting to discover the truth behind an international conspiracy after Harrison Ford’s Thaddeus Ross is elected as US president. It’s a return to the espionage-themed era of earlier Captain America films such as 2014’s The Winter Soldier, and to a lesser extent, 2016’s Civil War. Asked to explain how he is going to manage fighting the good fight without access to the super serum that Wilson decided not to take during the events of Disney+ spin-off The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Mackie suggested he would use his intellect to make up for any shortfall in firepower.

It got no better for Northern Ireland thereafter. A deficit of four goals will prove insurmountable, barring a form of sporting miracle. Continue reading...","Fri, 29 Nov 2024 21:03:20 GMT",0.0,0.709
The Guardian,‘You really want to beat your friends’: Wiegman steels England for USA test,"Both sides have key absences but England hope to learn from going toe-to-toe with Emma Hayes’s resurgent sideThe prospect of the European champions hosting the Olympic champions induces sufficient intrigue on its own. But add in the triumphant return to Wembley of Emma Hayes, and an England side with plenty to improve on after losing to Germany last time they played at the national stadium, and this is much more than a friendly between the top-ranked sides in the world.For an England team hoping to retain their title at next summer’s Euros in Switzerland, there is no greater yardstick than to test themselves against the USA, who are ranked No 1 and have appeared fully rejuvenated since Hayes left Chelsea to take charge in May.

The Guardian,Premiership returns amid fanfare but old problems lurk in background | Michael Aylwin,"Despite likely record ticket sales over Christmas, financial and physical health of clubs and players still a concernWith the timing of George Furbank on to a Fin Smith cutout pass, or that of any of the myriad attacking talents in English club rugby, the Premiership’s PR team ushered in the return of domestic fare this weekend by releasing a load of positive numbers. They refrained from deploying a load of exclamation marks too, but a few of those would have been perfectly consistent with the general vibe. The Premiership is back! And it’s never been better!First, boringly, to debunk some of the hyperbole, most of the stats relating to the uptick in viewing figures and attendances across the first six rounds of this season were positioned relative to last. Apparently, cumulative audiences on TNT Sports are up by 30% on this stage of the season last year; 21,000 more matchday tickets have been sold, an increase of 15%. But the start of last season coincided with the end of a World Cup, which tends to diminish figures for the domestic game. Continue reading...","Fri, 29 Nov 2024 23:13:06 GMT",-0.6956,0.8843

The Guardian,Brexit makes no sense in a world dominated by Trump. Britain’s place is back in the EU | Jonathan Freedland,"From defence to trade, the incoming US president is upending the old order – and standing apart from our neighbours leaves us dangerously exposedIt’s one damned thing after another. As Keir Starmer is discovering, government, like life, can feel like a fusillade of events, each coming faster than the one before. If it’s not a cabinet minister resigning over a past fraud conviction, it’s MPs voting for assisted dying – and that’s just in one day. Through that blizzard of news, it can be hard to make out the lasting changes in the landscape – even those that have profound implications for our place in the world.The November 2024 event that will have the most enduring global impact is the election of Donald Trump. There are some in the higher reaches of the UK government who are surprisingly relaxed about that fact, reassuring themselves that, in effect, we got through it once, we’ll get through it again. Yes, they admit, Trump has nominated some crazy people to lead in areas crucial to the UK-US relationship, such as defence and intelligence, but don’t worry, officials in London will do what they did last time: work with like-minded counterparts in the Washington bureaucracy to bypass the Trump loyalists at the top.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Fri, 29 Nov 2024 16:08:39 GMT",-0.296,0.1154
The Guardian,The assisted dying bill has passed. At last: a decent life can end in a decent death | Polly Toynbee,"MPs had a chance to make a seismic change to ease the suffering of countless people. I’m so glad they took itHere it is at last, a landmark that will be an enduring symbol and the humane legacy of this Labour government. Parliament has finally caught up with the public, who have long been firmly and unwaveringly in support of assisted dying since the first polls on the issue more than 40 years ago. What took MPs so long?In the debate today the reasons for that support were graphically and sometimes horrifically laid out by MPs, including Kim Leadbeater, in whose name this law will pass into history. The status quo is “cruel and dangerous” said Andrew Mitchell from the Tory benches. There is no “safe” avoidance of suffering, there is no certainty that palliative care will always prevent a horrible death. Morphine is no saviour, as I have witnessed in my own family. Leadbeater gave a terrible example: “Tom vomited faecal matter for five hours before he ultimately inhaled the faeces and died. He was vomiting so violently that he could not be sedated, and was conscious throughout” while his family pleaded with doctors to help.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Fri, 29 Nov 2024 15:53:27 GMT",-0.5994,-0.9475
The Guardian,"Gregg Wallace is in trouble. I would tell him to put a sock on it, but isn’t that what caused the problem? | Marina Hyde","As the MasterChef host ‘steps away’ from the show amid claims of inappropriate sexual banter, might he reflect on his approach to women and work?One of Gregg Wallace’s wives used to be charged with compiling his daily to-do list. As the MasterChef host once explained, in words he somehow said out loud: “It starts off every morning with ‘yoghurt’, then ‘leg band’, then it’ll be ‘teeth’, then it’ll say ‘tablets’ because I’ve got to take my cholesterol tablets and vitamin C, then ‘check BBC News’. Those are all the things I must do before I leave the flat. Then it’ll say ‘Twitter’ because I want to tweet twice a day, then it’ll say ‘H’ for Heidi because of all the things I need to discuss with her.”As you can see, at no stage does this list say “remove all clothes and walk around workplace with sock over penis” – so it’s a mystery why, in a period possibly contemporaneous with this list running his life, Gregg is alleged to have done that. And indeed, alleged to have joshed in a whole host of other inappropriate ways, over a period of 17 years, presumably under the aegis of other lists. Certainly while married to other wives. I’m sure Gregg would say that the idea that any list could schedule and micromanage his critically acclaimed banter would be absolutely ludicrous – and yet, I’m looking at the words “check BBC News” and thinking that perhaps he would not be the best arbiter of what is ludicrous.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Here’s one way to slash Britain’s rate of child poverty: stop dithering and make all fathers pay what’s due | Polly Toynbee,"A new report shows a bad situation is getting worse. This really is a case for draconian action from the stateMen don’t pay and won’t pay. Governments for more than 30 years have failed abysmally to make fathers pay for their children. The latest report, following a long line of them, shows how few fathers are paying maintenance, and how many separated mothers are giving up in despair. Child poverty has risen to 44% in single-parent households, but when children do receive maintenance it cuts the child poverty rate by 25%. Why does the state fail to collect on children’s behalf?The long and sorry saga of the Child Support Agency began in 1993. It was disastrously mismanaged from the start, arousing maximum rage with rebellious fathers’ protests for minimum actual collection of cash. When it was shut down, billions in arrears owed to mothers and children were simply wiped clean, never collected. The Child Maintenance Service (CMS) that replaced it has done no better. This week’s report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and Gingerbread, the single parents’ charity, finds 41% of parents caring for children (almost all women) have no maintenance agreement at all from non-resident parents (almost all fathers). They have been failed by the CMS.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistIn the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women’s Aid.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on assisted dying debate: a first hurdle cleared – many more lie ahead | Editorial,"MPs advanced the proposed bill. With ethical dilemmas and practical safeguards under scrutiny, challenges still remain unresolvedOn Friday, MPs voted to advance legislation on assisted dying in England and Wales, reflecting polling that shows widespread public support. However, a slim majority, of less than one-tenth of the House, should temper the confidence of its proponents. This is a profound, historic decision that demands careful consideration. Parliament was at its best in putting through the proposals to the next stage of deliberation. The debate was marked by sobriety and the welcome absence of partisan bickering. MPs approached the issue with humility, showing respect for every contribution, regardless of stance.The central tension between individual autonomy and societal responsibility was clearly highlighted by the discussion. MPs were right to allow for further detailed scrutiny, debate and potential amendments to ensure the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill addresses both ethical concerns and practical safeguards effectively. The desire to alleviate suffering is deeply compelling. The legislation proposes allowing mentally competent adults with a terminal diagnosis and less than six months to live to seek medical assistance to end their lives. Safeguards include independent assessments by two doctors, high court approval and a 14-day reflection period. Once the criteria have been met, a doctor may prescribe a self-administered life-ending medication. Continue reading...","Fri, 29 Nov 2024 18:30:04 GMT",0.1027,0.9891

This year’s winner, decided by public vote, will be announced on Monday.All six contenders on the shortlist have one thing in common – the internet. The words either refer to anxieties about online phenomena or behaviour (“slop”, meaning AI-generated content, and “brain rot” caused by consuming too much “slop” and other material); or they have been repurposed or popularised by social media (old-fashioned words such as “demure” and “lore”, and “romantasy” – a blend of romance and fantasy beloved by BookTokkers).

The Guardian,Weather tracker: Indonesia flash floods and landslides leave dozens dead,"Rescuers in Sumatra search for people trapped in cars after landslide triggered by torrential rainfall Last week, torrential rainfall across Indonesia’s largest island, Sumatra, triggered flash floods and landslides, causing widespread destruction. Twenty people died earlier this week in four areas in North Sumatra province amid flash floods and landslides. On Thursday morning, another devastating landslide claimed seven more lives. This landslide struck the main access route between Medan, the provincial capital, and surrounding regions, burying vehicles – including a tourist bus – in mud, rocks and trees. More than 10 people were injured and rushed to the nearest hospital in Medan. Rescue efforts are continuing, with several vehicles still trapped in the debris. North Sumatra’s traffic director estimated it may take up to two days to evacuate those affected.Flash floods and landslides are a frequent occurrence in Indonesia owing to seasonal rainfall from October to March, caused by the Asia-Australia monsoon circulation system. This phenomenon causes wind to blow from Asia to Australia, bringing increased water vapour and consequential rainfall to Indonesia. Teleconnections such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation can also influence rainfall patterns, with the likely upcoming La Niña phase expected to bring further extreme weather by the end of the year, intensifying the risk of flooding and landslides as sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean drop below average and easterly trade winds strengthen, pushing additional moisture into the region.

But how do you hiss, whisper and sing at the same time?Schoenberg’s Pierrot Lunaire broke the mould of what both chamber music and singing could be. Scored for five musicians playing eight instruments between them and a singer instructed not to sing, it was the perfect musical manifestation of expressionism, the cultural movement of the early 1900’s where creatives across the disciplines sought to capture the essence of emotions rather than physical realities.The work’s 21 poems explore themes of madness, death, sex, dreams, trauma and nostalgia through the character of Pierrot and his partners in crime, Harlequin and Columbine. The music – one of Schoenberg’s earliest moves towards atonality (the absence of a key, as we’d understand it) – can feel unsettling and haunting, yet has moments of breathtaking beauty, calm and a heady dose of romanticism to boot. However, it is the singer’s employment of sprechgesang – literally speak-sing – that even 100 years later, can still sound completely out of this world.

Trans medical care is under attack in many states. Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs that may help LGBTQ+ people as well as others are being eliminated. Justice Clarence Thomas has broached “revisiting” the supreme court decisions that legalized same-sex marriage.Many queer activists – panicked, tenacious, resolute – are asking what we can do in the face of these attacks that seek to dismantle basic rights and access that were presumed permanent.
