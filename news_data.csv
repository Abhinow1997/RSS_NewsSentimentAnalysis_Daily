The Guardian,"Iconic review – Bardot, Bacon and the Beatles bestride the plastic fantastic age","Holburne Museum, BathThis compact yet brilliant show looks at how painters responded to the subjugation of real life in the 1960s media age, with its explosion of photos, film and mass reproductionWhen Peter Blake painted a portrait of his friend David Hockney in 1965, he based it on a photograph. Why? He got on with his fellow Royal College of Art graduate and could have got him to pose. In fact, their relationship was relaxed enough for Hockney to suggest Blake include the male youth in Austrian jacket and shorts who stands behind him – also taken from a photograph.Hockney, with his round spectacles and bleached hair, looks right at us – or rather at a camera. Blake tries to capture in paint the photo’s harsh light and shadows, contrasting the secondhand, reproduced, even two-dimensional figures of Hockney and the youth with a bunch of balloons that are given a shiny, robust three-dimensional force. By painting a photo of the artist, instead of the artist, Blake suggests distance, mystery, loss. Hockney has become a kind of pop star and doesn’t seem quite real any more. The Bradford-born painting sensation had recently moved to Los Angeles, and it looks like the British-bound Blake is missing him. Continue reading...","Thu, 23 Jan 2025 00:01:27 GMT",0.5574,0.8271

But Robert Bolt’s play shows that being good could be just as dangerous for one’s head.This 1960 drama, which takes us through More’s last years, was immensely successful in its time, transferring to Broadway and adapted for film with Paul Scofield. Jonathan Church’s new touring production is smart and handsome but feels like an old-fashioned history play, creaky in parts though still an ultimately moving portrait of quiet heroism.

Why is he tortured by feelings of under-achievement? As Fellows hits the road, he pops an aniseed ball and discusses his new song – about an audience member falling off a cliffWhen Graham Fellows first performed in character as amateur singer-songwriter John Shuttleworth, Margaret Thatcher was PM and A-ha were storming the charts. Fellows was 25; his beige vocalist and organist alter ego was in his late 40s. “I started doing it when I was very young,” recalls Fellows, not a little wistfully, when we meet at his agent’s office in London. “And I had to put makeup on: crow’s feet, white stuff in my hair.”He goes on: “I remember doing a Lily Savage special in Blackpool for TV. And in the dressing room I was sat next to the lead singer of Showaddywaddy.” It never takes long for a Fellows/Shuttleworth anecdote to tend towards bathos. “He looked at me a bit askance and said, ‘This is odd. You’re there being made to look older, and I’m here being made to look younger.’” But the years roll around, and on the eve of his 40th anniversary tour as Shuttleworth, Fellows says: “I might have to start doing that now too.” Continue reading...","Wed, 22 Jan 2025 15:31:55 GMT",0.4199,-0.5267

The Guardian,A day to mark Prince Harry’s historic victory over Rupert Murdoch – and to survey the awful toll on public life | Jane Martinson,"The prince was right to fight – and also right about the need to stop good journalism being sullied by the bad. Trust has been severely damagedThe apology is “full and unequivocal”. The damages to be paid are huge. Appearing before the Leveson inquiry in 2011, Rupert Murdoch pronounced that to be “the most humble day of my life”. News Group’s settlement today of Prince Harry’s monumental case citing phone hacking, surveillance and misuse of private information by journalists and private investigators may make this another such day. It appears to vindicate Harry, not just in complaints about his treatment by the Murdoch press, but also the intrusions into the life of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. One can only speculate about the sting of that within the Murdoch empire.But if the best courtroom drama ends with a sense of justice being done and a triumphant winner, the long-awaited denouement is unlikely to win awards and the satisfaction for the victor, having settled the case must be – to some degree – limited. In this tale of celebrity, scandal and corruption there has been no obvious winner.Jane Martinson is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Friendliness is one of the few things they have going for them in the war against the machinesIn today’s hyper-connected world, where I can have anything from a power drill to a little chocolate pudding delivered to my door the same day, shops have it rough.

A jovial hello and a smile set the scene, followed by an inquiry about whether I’m looking for anything in particular that’s warmer than my interactions with some of my actual friends. Then – assuming that I’m not just bimbling about – there’s something like a treasure hunt, a look for a good book that might accumulate more members of staff, usually culminating with me buying something I’ve never even heard of before.

There’s no way I can conquer this January challenge | Arwa Mahdawi,"It’s time to celebrate all the little things in life, according to an annoyingly upbeat Belgian campaigner. But what if whingeing is actually good for you?April may be the cruellest month – but January is easily the most depressing. The weather outside is frightful and, around this time, everyone’s despondently giving up their new year resolutions. It’s dreary and dark and, if you’re the complaining sort (which, you may have noticed, I quite definitively am), there’s – waves hands vaguely at our crumbling dumpster fire of a planet – a lot to complain about. Indeed, a new report has found that champagne sales are sinking. Not just because of dry January, but because people can’t find much to celebrate.Enter Isabelle Gonnissen, a Belgian woman who seems to be annoyingly obsessed with positivity. She wants all the whingers and whiners out there to change their tune and celebrate the little things in life. Several years ago, Gonnissen launched a 30 Days Without Complaining challenge in Belgium; this year, she’s reportedly bringing it to the Netherlands. According to the NL Times, the campaign launched on Blue Monday (the third Monday of January), which is supposed to be the most depressing day of the year. It probably isn’t, by the way. Rather, Blue Monday is a pseudoscientific PR stunt that entrenched itself into our consciousness because it feels kind of true – but I’m not going to grumble about that now. In fact, I’m going to try not to grumble at all. There’s no way I can give up complaining for 30 days, but I’ll heroically give it a go for the next few sentences.

On an 80% turnout, the defending board survived with 65% of the votes.The other six investment trusts (companies that invest in other companies) await their turn, and it’s too soon to assume the UK crew will sweep the board. There were special factors at play at Herald. First, it has a famous fund manager, Katie Potts, who has a loyal following in the UK’s tech scene.

The Guardian,The strange loophole that transformed Berlin from tenant’s paradise to landlord’s playground | Tim White,"Germany’s capital was known for its affordable rents. Now ‘furnished temporary’ flats risk destroying the heart of the cityFrom London and other overpriced cities, we often look to Berlin as a beacon of progressive housing politics. Renting in the capital, as some 84% of households do, is associated with secure, unlimited, rent-controlled tenancies. Berliners have rallied behind moves to freeze rents and expropriate hundreds of thousands of apartments from corporate landlords. But in the last few years, Berlin’s housing crisis has escalated to unprecedented proportions, with median asking rents across the city rising by 21.2% in 2023 alone. Far from “poor but sexy”, as it was once dubbed by its own mayor, Berlin now has one of the most overheated property markets in the world.The reasons for Berlin’s housing crisis are complex, yet there is one simple and resolvable mechanism driving the stratospheric rent increases of recent years: the large-scale exploitation by landlords of a strange loophole in German federal law. If apartments are rented out as “temporary” and “furnished”, owners can evade tenancy regulations and charge considerably higher rents.Tim White is a researcher and writer studying housing, cities and inequality. He is Alexander von Humboldt research fellow at the Free University of Berlin and visiting fellow at the London School of Economics Continue reading...","Wed, 22 Jan 2025 07:00:13 GMT",0.5267,-0.8625
The Guardian,The Guardian view on Prince Harry and phone hacking: the ethical issues endure | Editorial,"Rupert Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers has apologised to the prince for past wrongs, but the problem of unaccountable corporate media power has not gone awayFor the publishers of the Sun, “sorry” is not the hardest word, but it is an expensive one. Rupert Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers has issued “a full and unequivocal apology” to Prince Harry for “serious intrusions” into his private life, including “unlawful activities”. For the first time it acknowledged that these were carried out by people working for the Sun – albeit private investigators rather than its journalists – as well as saying sorry for phone hacking, surveillance and misuse of private information by those working for the News of the World, which closed owing to the scandal.Substantial damages are being paid to the prince, adding to the Murdoch empire’s total bill for settlement of around 1,300 cases, which is thought to have exceeded £1bn. Prince Harry has also previously won&nbsp;damages from Mirror Group newspapers.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Belarus’s election: broken democratic dreams | Editorial,"Five years after an inspiring democracy movement almost toppled Alexander Lukashenko, his brutal rule remains intact. The west must do more to helpIn the summer of 2020, Belarus appeared to be on the cusp of an extraordinary democratic revolution. On the streets of Minsk and other cities, an unprecedented cross-section of civil society braved ferocious state violence to protest against a rigged presidential election. For the first time in decades, Alexander Lukashenko’s authoritarian grip on power appeared to be loosening. The opposition’s charismatic figurehead, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, told the European parliament: “Belarus has woken up.”The mass summer protests did indeed prove a turning point, but in the wrong direction. Amid fierce repression, mass detention, alleged torture and the forced exile of figures such as Ms Tsikhanouskaya, Mr Lukashenko stayed put. On Sunday, in a contest in which no genuine opposition candidate has been permitted to run, he will celebrate a seventh sham election victory after more than 30 years in power.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Self-swabbing does not provide protection for rape, nor even a “hologram of justice”. Any DNA collected by self-swabbing is likely to be worthless to the criminal justice system, because the collection methods cannot be independently verified.

The Guardian,Arsenal on verge of knockout stage as Havertz ensures win over Dinamo Zagreb,"Job done for Mikel Arteta. After the week he has had, the last thing the Arsenal manager would have wanted was another frantic finale to a home fixture. For much of this contest, after Declan Rice had fired the hosts in front after only 72 seconds, it seemed the Gunners may have to go the distance as they huffed and puffed but couldn’t find a second goal to see off a spirited Dinamo Zagreb side managed by their defensive master Fabio Cannavaro.A collective sigh of relief greeted the second goal from Kai Havertz – his 14th of the season – when it came 20 minutes before the end, as Martin Ødegaard added a third late on to virtually ensure Arsenal will finish in the top eight and avoid the need for a playoff next month. With a warm‑weather training camp in Dubai lined up instead, after their early exit from the FA Cup, it could do Arteta’s weary squad the world of good in the long run.

The Guardian,Rodrygo and Vinícius double up as Real Madrid hit five past hapless Salzburg,"“We will play and then we will see,” Carlo Ancelotti had said, so Real Madrid did their part and by the end of an ultimately easy night, life looked good again. The European champions started this match as the 22nd best team in the continent, somewhere towards the bottom of a table that keeps everyone guessing and supposedly on the edge of a catastrophe, and finished it six places higher and feeling as if they are among the favourites again. If, the coach was keen to stress, they can defend better.Madrid had been defeated by Lille, Milan and Liverpool, but there was time still and a revival to come and now a 5-1 victory over Red Bull Salzburg in their penultimate game has lifted them back among the seeds for the playoff round. With one game to go, against Brest next week, and the team taking shape, it also leaves them a single point off the top eight. Two goals each from Rodrygo and Vinícius and another for Kylian Mbappé mean Ancelotti’s side still have a small chance of completing the first phase of this new format going straight through to the last 16, although seven teams still stand between them and that target.

But the interpreter is more interested in songs than stardomSam Amidon grew up in the 1980s, but his Vermont childhood was “almost like a refuge” from the gaudiest decade. His hippy parents were folk-singer educators who frequently travelled south to work with Sacred Harp shape-note singers. “We were still eating granola and tofu stir fry, growing veggies and having potlucks,” he says. “Nobody had a television. I remember seeing a picture of Michael Jackson on somebody’s notebook, but I had no idea what he sounded like.” The family had one Talking Heads cassette, one Cyndi Lauper cassette and one Bob Dylan cassette, albeit of traditional songs. “The idea of the singer-songwriter model just wasn’t in my life.”Amidon followed his parents into music, becoming a fiddle prodigy and noted folk singer, releasing acclaimed albums for Nonesuch, and collaborating with jazz guitarist Bill Frisell, multi-instrumentalist Shahzad Ismaily, and folk-pop songwriter Beth Orton, whom he married in 2011.

The Guardian,Not a Word review – superbly strange tale makes the mundane mesmerising,"Barbican, LondonLittle happens in this wordless show about an Irish navvy who lives a lonely existence and yearns for home but it is oddly affectingOne egg cup on the shelf, one tin mug, one knife, a game of Solitaire. Such are the trappings of a lonely life. On stage is a sparse home, washed in grey dust, the light a specific shade of dingy. A weary body gets home from work, pulls off heavy boots, strips to saggy underwear. His head, though, is covered with a knobbly mask of thick clay, like a gargoyle, with a pinched nose and tiny eye holes. It’s an alienating presence.This is the work of Galway-based company Brú Theatre, led by director James Riordan (performed as part of MimeLondon, a descendant of the London International Mime festival). As the title suggests, there are no words, bar a final poem in Irish voiceover, on the experience of exile. The inspiration behind this odd, but oddly affecting piece of theatre, is the story of the Irish navvies, who emigrated to Britain in the 19th century to build railways and other infrastructure, and the lives of forgotten migrants, yearning for home.

But is it really such a problem? There’s only one way to find out …It is 10.30am on Thursday at Gatwick, and Jenny and her friend Alison, both 63, are drinking champagne. It’s an elegant scene. They are on a stopover between Barbados and Guernsey, and neither are planning to get drunk and kicked off their connecting flight. Alison describes the unique drinking culture at an airport. “We don’t know what day it is, never mind what time,” she says. “There aren’t any windows, so you can’t tell if it is day or night. Everyone is in a different time zone anyway, so nobody is looking at anyone else thinking, ‘They’re starting a bit early.’”The perfect environment, in other words, to enjoy a morning drink. But now I’m casting around my mind for every other place on Earth where one might have a breakfast beer or glass of wine: cricket matches; bottomless brunches; weddings. In every one of those scenarios, a good number of drinkers would be carousing after half an hour. But the airport is so serene. Continue reading...","Wed, 22 Jan 2025 09:00:15 GMT",0.6696,0.9631

My mother was so outraged by my questions she wouldn’t even talk about itAbout a decade ago, my po po (maternal grandmother) entered aged care. As Mum and I sorted through her belongings, I found a sepia photograph, hidden inside an almanac, of my grandmother and a woman I had never seen before. Po Po didn’t like to be photographed and rarely smiled in photos but, in this one, she looked happy. There was also an intimate air to their pose.I asked my mother about this woman, wondering if she was one of my grandmother’s lost friends. In the aftermath of the Vietnam war, many of them had fled the country in refugee boats but had not survived the journey. Mum said the woman had been the tenant of a spare room in their house and, for years, she and my grandmother had been inseparable. Then, one day, when my mum was about 11, the woman announced that she had met a man and would be going to live with him. My mum didn’t recall all the details, but she did remember my grandmother accusing the woman of “betrayal”. Afterwards, they never saw each other again.

The Guardian,Send us your questions for Pamela Anderson,"Got something you’d love to ask the former Baywatch star about her life and new career directions? Now’s your chanceDirector Gia Coppola had only one actor in mind to star in The Last Showgirl: Pamela Anderson. Having watched Ryan White’s Netflix documentary Pamela, A Love Story, Coppola knew she would be perfect as Shelly Gardner, an ageing Las Vegas dancer facing the closure of Le Razzle Dazzle, the classic revue she has starred in for three decades. The problem was, Anderson’s (now former) agent threw the script in the bin. Coppola did not take no for an answer. She got in touch with Anderson’s son Brandon Thomas Lee, who made sure the pitch reached his mum. Now trailing accolades, award nominations and an Oscar buzz, the film is bringing the 57-year-old icon something she struggled to find earlier in her career: respect.Having risen to fame as a Playboy Playmate, Anderson became an international superstar in the 1990s in Baywatch, which cemented the sex-symbol image she struggled for years to shake off. Recently, however, her public persona has morphed into something much more multilayered, thanks not only to the Netflix doc but also to her thoughtful 2023 memoir Love, Pamela and her well-received Broadway debut the previous year as Roxie Hart in Chicago.
