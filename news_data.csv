 A few years ago I was wandering around these streets, thinking it doesn’t look like the place I used to wander around as a student: no reggae shops, no guys on the corner smoking dope.

The majority of us say no – but science begs to differ,"Although greater awareness of prejudice would suggest we are less bigoted than ever, empirical evidence indicates notQ&amp;A with Keon West, author of The Science of RacismDo we still have a problem with racism? If you ask the average person even the most basic question about it – “Does racism still exist?” – half the population will say it doesn’t. According to a recent Guardian poll of British adults, more than half thought ethnic minorities faced less or the same discrimination as White people in most areas of life, such as the news, TV or films, the workplace, access to finance and jobs, and access to university or good schooling. Results in the US are similar. A 2021 Gallup poll revealed that slightly more than half of the White American population believe “racism against Black [people is] widespread in the US”. In the meantime, according to the same poll, slightly less than half of the White American population believe “racism against Whites [is] widespread in the US”. An earlier study (by Michael Norton and Samuel Sommers) showed that a growing number of White Americans believed “reverse racism”, or racism against White people, was the more prevalent form of racial bias.This kind of division in our society is a massive problem to which those in positions of authority offer no clear answers. Politicians frequently pretend to be experts on a host of issues such as racism – and vaccines, and the climate crisis, and evolution – but they’re not. If they don’t have degrees or past careers in social psychology or climate science or evolutionary biology, then they are no more experts in the topic than you are and are as sharply divided as the rest of us.

The Guardian,‘We think of the body as a map’: a new approach to deciphering long Covid,"People with post-infectious diseases sometimes struggle to communicate the debilitating impact of their conditions. But a new technique can help them explain visuallyPost-infectious diseases such as long Covid and ME/CFS (myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome) pose a puzzle to the medical establishment. Patients report debilitating symptoms such as extreme fatigue, shortness of breath or muscle pain, but often show normal results on routine medical checkups. And many sufferers do not look ill, leading some to question the severity of their disease. In the absence of diagnostic tools or an understanding of the pathophysiological processes, many sufferers find it difficult to share their experiences. They lack a verbal language that expresses the true impact of the illness.Now, researchers from Oxford University are using the technique of “body mapping” to help patients better communicate the physical, cognitive and emotional dimensions of their illness to family, friends and health professionals.

On an afternoon when Liverpool had 35 shots in 90 scoreless minutes, then won the game with their last two in added time, and when those goals were scored by Slot’s first substitute and created by his fourth, it was above all a very good game for the idea of process, control and calm intervention.Admittedly these are not generally qualities associated with a late match-winning, mane-tossing, nostril-snorting two-goal Darwin Núñez salvo. But this was how it played out at the Gtech under Slot’s hand. Núñez doubled his league goal tally for the season. He resembled, as ever, and at all moments, a footballer being chased around the pitch by a swarm of invisible bees. He also came away looking on the metrics like a precision stealth weapon deployed at just the right moment. Continue reading...","Sat, 18 Jan 2025 19:21:55 GMT",0.6705,0.9336

When he looked up again, he had his thumb and forefinger to his eyes. It was the fifth minute of injury time, Leandro Trossard had just rolled a shot wide and Arsenal’s final chance had vanished. With it, perhaps, so had their hopes of winning the league. At the very least, the gains of Wednesday were handed back.As it turned out Trossard, who had been Arsenal’s most dangerous forward, may have been a fraction offside anyway, which perhaps would have been the most fitting conclusion. In the previous eight minutes, Mikel Merino had seen a goalbound shot deflected in off Kai Havertz’s hand and hit the inside of a post. There was a sense in those closing stages of the fates, or at least Arsenal’s chronic inability to seize the moment, being against them.

From Switzerland and Sweden to Hungary, Austria and Italy, European nations are coming under the influence of extreme nativist parties that are hostile to democratic institutions, immigrant populations and fact-based journalism.By exploiting economic concerns and a growing distrust of political and media institutions, these reactionary populists have been able to attract new supporters. In Germany, the AfD is on course for a breakthrough in next month’s federal elections. In France, the National Rally is topping presidential polls. And, of course, in the US, Donald Trump is back.
 These are deeply worrying times, especially if you’re a member of a minority community. As historians and commentators increasingly find echoes of the 1920s and 30s in the present day, we cannot afford to throw in the towel. We must make a renewed and concerted effort to confront these forces and expose them for what they are: opportunists who seek to divide people for personal and political gain. Not to mention their financial backers who selfishly choose to put the profits of their companies over the interests of our democracies.

The Guardian,"Who will tame Donald Trump this time? Roll up, roll up, for the White House travelling circus | Simon Tisdall","On the eve of his return, it’s clear that world leaders, whether they like him or loathe him, can’t ignore this unpredictable showmanMichelle Obama’s one-woman boycott of Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration on Monday requires no explanation. It’s plain that the former first lady has zero tolerance and even less love for a man who delights in racist and sexist behaviour. Lots of other people, especially among US allies in Europe, would boycott Trump, too, if they could. Yet, inescapably, they must deal with him for the next four years.Such fear and loathing is by no means universally shared. A poll, published last week by the European Council on Foreign Relations, found that in China, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, South Africa and Brazil, more people welcome Trump’s return than deplore it. In contrast, people in the UK, France, Germany and a clutch of other west European countries are frankly appalled at the prospect. Continue reading...","Sat, 18 Jan 2025 17:30:31 GMT",0.0,-0.7713

The Guardian,"With his toxic revamp, Emperor Zuckerberg is preparing to be Trump’s puppet | John Naughton","The Meta boss has embraced masculinity and abandoned fact-checking and decorum. Is this the future of the tech industry?Years ago the Economist magazine had a striking cover in which Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, was portrayed as a languid clone of the Roman emperor Augustus. This was inspired by stories that Zuck was fascinated by Gus. On honeymoon in Rome in 2012, for example, he took so many photos of the emperor’s sculptures that his wife joked it was as if there were three people on the holiday. The couple even named their second daughter August.Explaining his fascination for Rome’s first emperor, Zuckerberg told the New Yorker that “basically, through a really harsh approach, he established 200 years of world peace… What are the trade-offs in that? On the one hand, world peace is a long-term goal that people talk about today [but] that didn’t come for free, and he had to do certain things.” Continue reading...","Sat, 18 Jan 2025 16:00:33 GMT",0.0,0.9241
The Guardian,The Traitors shows how herd mentality tramples on our basic instincts | Martha Gill,"In the hit TV reality show, as in life, we like to think we are autonomous. In fact, we follow the herdWhat explains the stupendous success of The Traitors? More than 9 million people tuned in to the first episode of this, its third season, and last week it overtook Strictly Come Dancing to become the BBC’s most watched reality show. With this sort of trajectory, I’m afraid we must prepare for thousands of imitators to follow in its wake. So what should they be trying to do?Part of the attraction of the show is its host, Claudia Winkleman, who presides over the setting – a luscious castle in Scotland – in the manner of a campy gothic headmistress: talking softly to owls, ruthlessly ordering contestants into coffins and gunge, and all the while managing to navigate the set through the tiny sliver of daylight between low fringe and high roll-necked jumper.

From the smoldering, forested lots of Paradise to the leveled Lahaina homes overlooking the Pacific, I’ve documented the stories of people who ran for their lives, held the hands of badly burned fire victims and trudged alongside families searching for their missing loved ones.But nothing prepared me for the overwhelming sense of loss that permeates Altadena in the aftermath of the Eaton fire. It’s not just the figures, though they are shocking – nearly 7,000 homes burned and at least 16 dead.

The Guardian,I was ambassador to the UK last time Trump was in office - this is what Starmer must do this time | Kim Darroch,"The old alliances have been swept away, and foreign policy needs to reflect this new realityFriday 20 January&nbsp;2017, Washington DC: ­overcast skies with the threat of rain for the inauguration of the new president, Donald J Trump. All of Washington was there: former presidents, ­senior ­politicians, supreme court ­justices and, in the seats furthest from the action, the Washington diplomatic corps. But our viewpoint, on the uppermost levels of the temporary ­amphitheatre erected on the West Front of the Capitol, allowed us to see beyond the stage, all the way down the National Mall; and note that the crowd below looked rather smaller than the 1.8 million estimated to have attended Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration.Trump would say afterwards that the rain stopped, as if by divine intervention, at the moment he began to deliver his ­inaugural address. We diplomats in the ­gallery had exactly the ­opposite ­impression – that the heavens opened just as the speech started, with Trump’s opening words drowned out by the rustle of ­several hundred ­plastic ponchos being unfolded and donned (with George W Bush ­memorably failing to locate the appropriate aperture in his, and resorting to draping it over his head like a collapsed umbrella).

The Guardian,Adding a couple of planters and slightly widening the pavement is hardly ‘reimagining’ a neighbourhood | Rachel Cooke,"The on-trend word reeks of desperation, an attempt to make the unpalatable sound dreamy, while the reality is a nightmareLots of fashionable words ring alarm bells, but the one that’s giving me the pip right now is “reimagine”. Sure, it’s fine to assert that in her novel Wide Sargasso Sea Jean Rhys reimagines elements of Jane Eyre. But can the same ever really be said of an apartment block or a hamburger? Its deployment often reeks of desperation, an attempt to make the controversial or the unpalatable sound dreamy and magical. No, you may not be able to see the beauty in what lies ahead, but that’s only because you’re a philistine with no vision.Near our house, a major “reimagining” is under way in the form of the construction of the borough’s first “livable neighbourhood”, the initial stages of which (faffing with pavements) have closed a major arterial road, pushing yet more traffic and several bus routes on to another, already-clogged thoroughfare – and the result is chaotic. Journey times have doubled; the air is thick with fumes born of traffic jams. Putting aside the fact that the neighbourhood in question is perfectly “livable” already, isn’t it always the case that these schemes inevitably make life very much less so for those who live or work just adjacent to them?

The Guardian,The Observer view on the Gaza ceasefire: it’s time for both sides to think again,"This brief, fragile pause is a chance for all involved in the Israel-Palestine conflict to accept that violence does not work The ceasefire in Gaza, due to begin tomorrow, will bring welcome relief from daily violence but amounts, at present, to little more than a fragile, temporary pause in a conflict that is far from over. Israel has not achieved its principal war aim, as defined by its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu: the total elimination of Hamas. Nor has Hamas achieved its objective: the destruction of Israel. The leaders responsible for the 7 October 2023 terrorist atrocities are dead. The organisation’s capabilities are severely reduced. But it has survived – which its supporters claim is a victory for Palestinian sumud (steadfastness).Most of the 98 remaining Israeli hostages, alive and dead, will not be freed in this first phase of the ceasefire, which is to last for six weeks. There is no agreed “day after” strategy for devastated Gaza, where nearly 47,000 Palestinians have died and where the hungry and mostly homeless residents exist in a state of near-anarchy, plagued by criminal gangs. And there is nothing in sight that remotely resembles what the Americans call a “pathway to peace” – a long-term plan to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict on the basis of two independent, sovereign states.

The Guardian,‘It’s an absolute travesty’: fears for border wildlife as Trump takes office,"Environmentalists are braced for new construction on the president’s signature border wall – and the damage that would wreakDuring Donald Trump’s first presidential term, he began an ambitious and costly border militarization program, including the construction of over 450 miles of wall that severed wildlife corridors and fragmented ecosystems in some of the country’s most remote and biodiverse regions. With his second inauguration on Monday, environmentalists are bracing for any new phase of construction that could exacerbate the ecological toll of the border wall.“It’s an absolute travesty and a disaster for border wildlife,” said Margaret Wilder, a human-environment geographer and political ecologist at the University of Arizona, regarding the environmental impact of the existing border wall and the prospect of renewed construction. She said the wall harmed efforts “after many decades of binational cooperation between the US and Mexico to protect this fragile and biodiverse region.

In our own homes, the reality may depend more on whichever bedding happens to be clean that day. The sheets might have been crisp and brilliant white at one point, but now have seen better days. Sound familiar? It could be time for an upgrade. Be smart about what you buy and look after it well and it should last you well into the next decade.While for some, five-star-worthy white cotton is the only way to go, others prefer to add a little detail: a subtle stripe, say, or some pretty embroidery in a contrasting colour.

The Guardian,Ex-Vöid: In Love Again review – all of indie rock is here,"(Tapete)This latest iteration of Lan McArdle and Owen Williams’s Joanna Gruesome turns their lush vocals, guitar heroics and recent heartbreaks into melodic goldAlmost exactly a decade ago, I reviewed a tremendous band playing live in a basement in Dalston, east London; a venue so off-piste that condensation ran down the exposed light fittings. The band were called Joanna Gruesome – the name a snarky pun on that of the US baroque pop singer Joanna Newsom. Even then, its members had history, having come out of various teenage DIY outfits in Wales; in 2014 they won the Welsh Music prize for their debut, Weird Sister.Joanna Gruesome’s twin frontpeople, Lan McArdle (they/them) and Owen Williams (he/him), shared vocals; they sang deliciously, apart and together, in keeping with late 80s indie pop stylings – early My Bloody Valentine was just one touchpoint. But their guitars meant serious business, transcending the studied amateurism of the punk underground for arty heft. Their melodies served up lashings of pop nous. McArdle eventually left; the band slowly fizzled out. Continue reading...","Sat, 18 Jan 2025 14:00:27 GMT",0.6369,0.664

This is the chemical that nudges you towards things you enjoy, helping you muster the effort required to attend a party you’re on the fence about, then showering you with a sense of reward when you actually have a great time. Dopamine works with other neurotransmitters like serotonin to give you a sense of momentum: do one thing to give yourself a mood boost, and the cascading effects of that decision can help you break out of a rut and resuscitate your zest for life. January, with its clean slate, is the ideal time to rev this process up.Enter the concept of the dopamine menu: a fresh sheet of stimulating activities designed to lift your spirits: quick “starters” that take relatively little time and effort to pull off; more substantial “mains”; and subtle “sides” or indulgent “desserts”.

Those who were there reflect on the anarchy and the legacyFifty years since the launch of 2JJ, or Double Jay – the station that became Triple J in 1981 – radio’s former enfant terrible is now legacy media. Once the cornerstone of Australian popular music and youth culture, it risks irrelevance as listener numbers dwindle in the face of social media and streaming services. Or, as its defenders will argue, maybe the critics are simply nostalgic for when Australia’s youth radio station was aimed at them: there is a joke within the ABC that on the second day that Double Jay was on air, someone rang up and complained that it wasn’t as good as it used to be.When Double Jay launched at 11am on Sunday 19 January 1975, the brief from Arthur Wyndam, then ABC’s head of radio, was that the station should: give public concerts, expose the public to new music, and record the music made in its studios and at its concerts for broadcasting purposes. At the time, youth radio was serviced by Top 40 AM stations; Double Jay was established along the lines of “underground” radio stations, playing an eclectic selection of music unconstrained by formats.

It could be mere vanity but also I think mirrors show us the passage of time etched on our faces.”MirrorMirror: The Reflective Surface in Contemporary Art (Thames &amp; Hudson, £45) is out now Continue reading...","Sat, 18 Jan 2025 17:00:32 GMT",0.0,0.3284
