Troy_McClure
 I absolutely had no idea. It didn’t even represent what we were doing, because No Doubt were such an uptempo, live-energy band. Even the guitar solo has no business being in that song. The original version was written by my brother [Eric, keyboards], who lived at my grandparents’ house; after they passed away, it became the band house. He’d stay up all night eating peanut butter sandwiches, drinking milk and smoking cigarettes and go: “Oh, I wrote this last night.”Then I ended up rewriting the lyrics and changing the whole song because Tony [Kanal, bass] broke up with me. It’s crazy, but that song really is the heartbeat of who I am and changed everything. After it came out, we were driving through Israel and these guards came up to the van with guns, which I’d never seen anywhere before. One of them looked in the van and started singing Don’t Speak to me. That soon became normal. Continue reading...","Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:00:32 GMT",0.0,0.2665

For Nasa print dealer Daniel Blau, they are proof that nothing is impossible when nations collaborateIt was one of history’s monumental moments – but if John Glenn hadn’t popped into the supermarket to pick up a Contax camera and a roll of 35mm film on his way to board the Friendship 7, there may have been no visual document of it. The photographs the American astronaut took from the window of his capsule as he orbited Earth on 20 February 1962 gave an unprecedented testimony of the Mercury Project’s first orbital mission. The Soviet Union might have beaten the Americans in the race to human spaceflight – but the Americans had now shot the first galactic colour photographs.The pictures are also, German gallerist Daniel Blau points out, “the most expensive photographs ever taken. Billions of dollars were spent to get them.” Blau exhibited an original print of Glenn’s first picture taken in space at this year’s Paris Photo, alongside a cache of rare Nasa photographic prints – many of them never publicly seen before, most of them by unknown scientists and astronauts.

As Donald Trump readies himself for his revenge tour, world leaders and business moguls are falling over themselves to show the incoming president how much they admire him. Even if it means making an embarrassment of themselves in the process.While it’s only natural for the rich and powerful to try to ingratiate themselves with the incoming president of the United States, the extent to which people are lining up to kiss the ring is remarkable. This isn’t just diplomacy as usual: it speaks to Trump’s unapologetically transactional politics.

The Guardian,The right to die is about freedom – don’t let those who see it as a line on a spreadsheet torpedo it | Polly Toynbee,"MPs soon have a once-in-a-generation chance to vote for the assisted dying bill. Wes Streeting must not derail itThat is a low blow, health secretary. On a matter of life, death and personal freedom, the debate should be elevated above this. Wes Streeting cheapens discussion on the right to die by suggesting there is no money to pay for a doctor to hand a dying patient the lethal dose they request. Disingenuously, he suggests that finding the funding would mean cuts to other services. It would have “resource implications” that would “come at the expense of other choices”. He made this unevidenced assertion before asking his department to look at any possible costs that implementing the legislation could incur. If he really wants to bring in the crude question of cash, I assume his department will assess savings in bed-days and staff time from those who choose to depart intensive end-of-life care a little sooner.In two weeks’ time, parliament will vote on Kim Leadbeater’s assisted dying bill. The process would require two doctors to sign witnessed statements from a mentally competent patient who has been diagnosed as likely to die within six months. Then the application must be heard by a high court judge, who can question doctor or patient. Then there must be a 14-day pause before the patient self-administers life-ending medication. It is such a long process that many may die waiting in agony.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Thu, 14 Nov 2024 14:11:48 GMT",0.0772,-0.8837

The Guardian,Realism arrives at Burberry after fashion (and share buyback) mistakes | Nils Pratley,"After stunning collapse in profits, chief executive aims to ‘course correct’ and ‘celebrate heritage’The prize for the most hubristic share buyback of recent years goes to Burberry. Only 12 months ago the fashion group was boasting about how it had just completed a £400m buyback, its second of that size in two years. Now, after a stunning collapse in profits, the company can’t even afford to give its shareholders a dividend and the (inevitably) new chief executive is talking about the need to “course correct” and stabilise the business “with urgency”. That 2023 buyback saw stock bought around the £20 level. Price now: 868p. What a waste of shareholders’ funds.The better news is that 868p was a 19% gain on the day because the new course, described on Thursday by Joshua Schulman, the new man from Coach, read as realistic after predecessor Jonathan Akeroyd’s failed attempt to push the brand relentlessly upmarket.

But when her half-brother that I knew nothing about got in touch, I was faced with an agonising decisionI’m sitting in my great-aunt’s retirement home on the outskirts of Detroit, Michigan. It’s not yet October, but for reasons I don’t quite understand the home is throwing a Thanksgiving dinner for residents and guests. I join my great-aunt June and the other octogenarians piling up their paper plates at the buffet. Then we sit at trestle tables lined with tiny pumpkins, while framed photos of the recently deceased sit on top of the grand piano, seemingly looking our way.The early holiday celebrations weren’t the only surprise when I arrived in Michigan. I was there to research a book I was writing about the history of the women’s movement, but also about my mother, whose life story echoes the rise and fall of second-wave feminism. In 1974, a year after Roe v Wade passed, my 22-year-old mother travelled from Essex, England to New York City and took a Greyhound bus across the country to visit June, who was then living in Omaha, Nebraska. At that time, my mum’s life, as it was for so many women of the era, was full of promise.

The Guardian,"The Guardian view on Ireland’s general election: as always, this contest matters for Britain too | Editorial","Simon Harris has called a vote for 29 November because he is leading in the polls. But the current economic boom masks serious inequalitiesIreland’s imminent general election on 29 November has aroused little interest in Britain. Many here may not even know it is taking place. No surprise there, unfortunately. It was ever thus for Britain’s insular political class. Compared with the attention lavished on the American election, albeit this year an exceptionally important one, the Irish election has barely registered. But is what happens in Wisconsin really more important for Britain than what happens in Wicklow? Centuries of history suggest the opposite.It does not, however, require specialist knowledge of Irish politics to see why the Fine Gael taoiseach, Simon Harris, has called a snap election in just two weeks’ time. The previous Dáil, elected in 2020, could in theory have remained in existence until next March. But Mr Harris, who succeeded Leo Varadkar as his party’s leader in April, has long wanted a contest this month. He has gone to the country now because he sees it as Fine Gael’s best chance.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on regulating psychotherapy: people need help to find safe help | Editorial,"A new legal framework for talking therapies would take careful work. But better signposting could happen nowHundreds of thousands of people each year in the UK seek help from counsellors and psychotherapists. But the case earlier this year of Ella Janneh, who was awarded £217,000 in damages after suing a sex therapist for personal injury and negligence, has reignited calls for statutory regulation.This was considered by the last Labour government, is backed by a number of MPs, and is certain to be on the agenda of the all-party parliamentary group on mental health. What campaigners want is for “psychotherapist” and “counsellor” to become legally protected titles. Among other things, this would enable people found guilty of professional misconduct to be struck off. Ms&nbsp;Janneh is rightly appalled by the prospect that the man who abused her, Michael Lousada, could do the same thing to someone else. Currently, there is no law to stop anyone from setting themselves up in business as a therapist or counsellor without qualifications – even if they have faced sanctions before.

The Guardian,The Anglican church’s long history of failing to act on abuse | Letters,"Pam Walker says the church hierarchy has a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of abuse, and Doug Clark compares Anglican and Catholic scandals. Plus a letter from John van RooyenAs a lay minister in Newcastle diocese, I strongly supported Helen-Ann Hartley’s call for the archbishop of Canterbury to resign (Bishop calls for Justin Welby to resign over failure to pursue serial abuser, 11 November), and I am relieved he has done so. For almost 40 years, since the abuse scandal surrounding the Nine O’Clock Service in Sheffield, the Church of England has attempted to ignore, minimise or deny the suffering caused by abuse in church settings. The leader of that church is awaiting trial on 34 counts of sexually abusing women (which he denies).Meanwhile, while awaiting the publication of the Smyth review, Fiona Scolding KC and Ben Fullbrook published a report into the Soul Survivor church, commissioned after the national safeguarding team (NST) stated that its leader, Mike Pilavachi, “used his spiritual authority to control people and that his coercive and controlling behaviour led to inappropriate relationships, the physical wrestling of youths and massaging of young male interns”.

I had the great good fortune to spend a decade as artistic director of his favourite theatre, the Bristol Old Vic, and that enabled me to get to know this giant of British theatre from a slightly unusual point of view.Tim had grown up in Bristol, watching his father, Lockwood West, performing with the Rapier Players at the Little theatre, now part of the Beacon concert venue. When I met Tim and Pru [his wife, Prunella Scales] to talk about the refurbishment of the Bristol Old Vic, he took me on a tour of the city, unravelling the architectural monstrosities of the 1960s and 70s and revealing the city as it was when he had wandered it as a child in the 1930s. He took me through the old Horsefair towards the Empire theatre in the Old Market (forbidden territory for young Tim) and back through Victoria Street to the Old Vic where he had always longed to perform, where he had served as a board member and leading actor in the 1980s, and where he finally agreed to return to perform King Lear for the theatre’s 250th birthday in 2016. At every step of the walk, enthusiasm bubbled from him like a fountain. Continue reading...","Thu, 14 Nov 2024 10:37:48 GMT",0.0,0.9584

It’s amazing how three little letters can encompass something so big. From sexual identity to sexual pleasure, sex can mean so many things. But what about sexual wellness? And what does sexual wellness, in the context of menopause, even mean?Wildly open to interpretation, I’d say my sexual wellness anchors around three things: the mind (as in desire or lack of), the body (relating to both comfort and discomfort), and the soul (should I really be enjoying/pursuing sex given the broader stereotypical view when it comes to older women and sex?).

No, the best – the person who in every measure wins out over all the others. It’s a stupid question, isn’t it; one you literally cannot answer. Let’s try something seemingly easier: what’s the best restaurant you’ve ever visited? After 25 years of restaurant reviewing, I&nbsp;am asked this question often. After all, I’ve eaten out a lot. I have acquired a significant number of data points. I&nbsp;should therefore be qualified to come up with a helpful, definitive answer.Except, the deeper into this job I&nbsp;get, the more exasperating I find it.

The Guardian,"Cake without mistakes: how to avoid baking pitfalls, from sunken centres to stuck bundts","The brains behind cult Sydney cake shop Flour and Stone shares her tips for better home bakingAnyone can bake. I really mean that! But sometimes a baking failure can be disheartening – there’s no sinking feeling like a sunken cake.When it comes to baking, practise does eventually make perfect. There are some common baking mishaps that, like life, just happen. Here are some tips to help you avoid some more common catastrophes and ensure you become a better baker.The raising agent has expired. If the cake has a raising agent, such as baking powder, this needs to be incorporated into the cake batter swiftly and then the cake placed into the oven immediately. Baking powder is activated the minute it comes into contact with liquid and so the longer it sits in the cake tin before baking, the higher the chances of its “raising powers” expiring. The cake did not start baking at a high enough temperature. A cake made with flour and raising agent (as above) needs a higher temperature when it first goes into the oven to “lift” the crumb. Make sure to preheat your oven well in advance so that once the cake goes in, it begins cooking and takes full advantage of the baking powder’s power.Whatever the recipe, preheat the oven to 10C higher than instructed. Once you open the door the oven will lose heat, the cake will take longer to rise, and the aforementioned raising agent will become exhausted and lose the will to live. When the cake is in, shut the door and lower the heat to the prescribed recipe temperature.The butter wasn’t soft enough. When I say soft, I mean like the texture of dollop cream, not simply at room temperature. There are two reasons you need sufficiently soft butter: to allow any sugar to meld properly with the butter and create a fluffy base, and to encourage the eggs to emulsify with the butter more easily. Eggs will struggle to combine with butter that is too firm.The eggs weren’t at room temperature. Eggs don’t like to be cold when mingling with butter. Pull them out of the fridge the night before to allow them to come up to room temperature.You tried to add whole eggs to the butter. Give the eggs a little whisk with a fork to break them up and this will assist their union with the butter.I think a lot of cake recipes have too much flour in them. Cut the flour quantity with a proportion of nut meal to impart moisture and lower the gluten (ultimately, gluten gives the cake its dryness).The cake batter has curdled as you’re making it (see above). A curdled cake will need to cook for longer because the structure of the batter is broken. This usually results in a dry cake.The cake doesn’t have enough fat. Depending on the cake you’re making, increase the fat – oil, milk or butter – already in the recipe. Start with a modest increase – about 10%. This will lighten the cake and impart more moisture that then translates to steam. Continue reading...","Thu, 14 Nov 2024 14:00:18 GMT",-0.2709,0.9751

Decades of agonisingly difficult negotiations built up a dense structure of treaties, agreements and even a few unilateral moves dealing with offensive and defensive nuclear weapons of short, medium and long range, with provisions for testing, inspections and an overflight regime for mutual observation. Often the two sides would only give up systems they no longer wanted. Frequently the language of the agreements was the basis of future friction.
