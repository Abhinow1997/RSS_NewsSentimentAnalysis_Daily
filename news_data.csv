The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Russia vows to retaliate after state media reportedly blocked on Telegram in EU,"Moscow says the move is ‘censorship’ and that it reserves the right to ‘respond in the same manner’. What we know on day 1,041Russia has vowed to retaliate after the channels of its state media were apparently blocked on the popular Telegram social media platform in the EU. On Sunday the channels of Ria Novosti news agency, Rossiya 1, Pervyi Kanal and NTV television, and Izvestia and Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspapers were not accessible in several countries, including France, Belgium, Poland, Greece, the Netherlands and Italy, according to media reports. Neither Telegram nor EU sources have yet commented on the disruption. Moscow called the move “an act of censorship”. “The systematic cleansing of all undesirable sources of information from the information space continues,” foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, said. The EU had previously banned Russian state media such as Ria Novosti, Izvestia and Rossiyskaya Gazeta from being distributed in the bloc, accusing them with disseminating propaganda.Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, said on Sunday that the Azerbaijani airliner that crashed last week was shot down by Russia, albeit unintentionally, as he criticised Moscow for trying to “hush up” the issue. “We can say with complete clarity that the plane was shot down by Russia … We are not saying that it was done intentionally, but it was done,” he told Azerbaijani state television. Aliyev said that the airliner, which crashed in Kazakhstan on Wednesday and killed 38 of the 67 on board, was hit by fire from the ground over Russia and “rendered uncontrollable by electronic warfare.” Aliyev accused Russia of trying to “hush up” the issue for several days, saying he was “upset and surprised” by versions of events put forward by Russian officials. The Kremlin said that air defence systems were firing near Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, where the plane attempted to land, to deflect a Ukrainian drone strike.Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Monday that Jimmy Carter, who died aged 100, served as US president when Ukraine was not yet independent but “his heart stood firmly with us in our ongoing fight for freedom”. “We deeply appreciate his steadfast commitment to Christian faith and democratic values, as well as his unwavering support for Ukraine in the face of Russia’s unprovoked aggression,” Zelenskyy said on X. “Today, let us remember: peace matters, and the world must remain united in standing against those who threaten these values.”A probe of the sabotaged Baltic Sea power cable has uncovered a drag trail stretching dozens of kilometres on the seabed, Finnish police said on Sunday. On Christmas Day, the Estlink 2 submarine cable that carries electricity from Finland to Estonia was disconnected from the grid, just over a month after two telecommunications cables were severed in Swedish territorial waters in the Baltic. Finnish authorities have been investigating the Eagle S oil tanker that sailed from a Russian port over suspected “sabotage”. The investigation has revealed a “dragging track” on the seabed, police said on Sunday, adding the trail had been identified “from the beginning to the end”. The cable’s disconnection was the latest in a spate of incidents western officials believe are acts of sabotage linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Aleksei Bugayev, a former member of Russia’s national soccer team who played at Euro 2004, has been killed in the 34-month-old war in Ukraine, Russian media quoted his father and agent as saying on Sunday. “Unfortunately, the news about Aleksei’s death is true. It happened today,” TASS news agency quoted the player’s father Ivan Bugayev as telling the Sport24 news outlet.
 RIA news agency quoted Bugayev’s agent, Anton Smirnov, as saying intense fighting had made it impossible to retrieve Bugayev’s body for burial. In September, Bugayev was sentenced by a court in southern Russia to nine and a half years in prison on drug trafficking charges. He later declared his intention to sign up to fight in the Ukraine war. Russian authorities actively recruit in prisons for the conflict.Georgia inaugurated a far-right governing party loyalist, Mikhail Kavelashvili, as president on Sunday, ratcheting up a months-long political crisis that has seen huge pro-European Union demonstrations.

The Guardian,The Split: Barcelona review – there are moments that are just ludicrously sexy,"This sharp, witty Catalan spinoff of the BBC divorce lawyer series sees Nicola Walker’s Hannah on stunning form – with moments of frisson guaranteed to raise temperaturesThere’s no question that the stakes are low in The Split: Barcelona. Its plot? A family of high-flying divorce lawyers go to a mansion set at the top of a rolling vineyard for a wedding and suffer a series of slight disappointments. But the return of The Split – and its smart, well heeled and sensible characters – is still an utterly enchanting piece of work.After three acclaimed series created by Emmy-winning writer Abi Morgan, the Defoe family of divorce lawyers reunite for two episodes where Hannah (the resplendent Nicola Walker) and ex-husband Nathan’s (Stephen Mangan) daughter Liv (Elizabeth Roberts) is due to marry into a Spanish wine dynasty, with a new mother- and father-in-law who spend most of their dialogue describing the intensity of their three-decades-old love. But things are further complicated when Liv has to sign a prenup and it transpires that the family lawyer who devised it is Archie (the perma-smouldering Toby Stephens) – whom Hannah ghosted during a bout of acute commitment-phobia after six extremely hot dates.The Split aired on BBC One and is available on iPlayer Continue reading...","Sun, 29 Dec 2024 22:00:18 GMT",0.4939,0.909

The Guardian,Does life feel like it’s speeding up? How to slow down time in 2025,"Time flies when you’re… in a boring routine, according to research, which shows that new experiences, from foreign travel to a walk in nature, can alter our perception of timeIt’s the time of the year for endless cliches. From “tis the season” and “the gift that keeps on giving” to “new year, new you”, there’s nowhere to hide from tired old phrases. One of my favourites is “Christmas comes around quicker each year” – which ignores the fact that one year equals one trip around the sun.There’s often a kernel of truth in a cliche, though. A recent study by Ruth Ogden from Liverpool John Moores University and colleagues showed that the vast majority of people in both the UK and Iraq really did experience Christmas (or Ramadan) approaching more rapidly every year. This may be down partly to festive decorations appearing ever earlier in the season. But it’s also a result of how we perceive time psychologically.

Now, say researchers, women and girls are being sucked into potentially dangerous online spaces of their own: the femosphere.It is a term used by Dr Jilly Kay, an expert in feminist media and cultural studies at Loughborough University, in a paper published earlier this year. Kay has been researching a reactionary turn among young women, and how a backlash against mainstream feminism has created new spaces online. In the femosphere, instead of “incels” – male involuntary celibates – there are “femcels”, and instead of pickup artists there are female dating strategists and so-called “dark feminine” influencers who encourage women to find men to support them financially.

Local councils in England say that “overspending” on special needs education – manifested in an annual funding gap of at least £3bn, even after the government put in extra money – now threatens more municipal bankruptcies. In the media, meanwhile, culture-warrior columnists now habitually question whether the word “needs” is even appropriate. Increases in the incidence of such conditions as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), they say, may be a scam partly perpetrated by the merchants of identity politics, and families who manage to get dedicated help are the recipients of “golden tickets”: by implication, if people in power want to save money, there is no end of waste and mollycoddling to tackle.

The Guardian,With a new year ahead there’s no better time for Keir Starmer to start playing good cop | Isabel Hardman,"The prime minister should resolve in 2025 to enthuse about his vision, and leave moaning about the Tories and fiscal hardship to his chancellorWho is dreading the new year more: Keir Starmer or Rachel Reeves? Most people look forward to the turn of the year as a chance that better things might be on the way, but it’s hard for the prime minister and chancellor to glance ahead to the next few months and expect 2025 to be any more fun than the latter half of 2024. Reeves has a spending review&nbsp;where she is expecting ministers to find 5% efficiencies in their departments, so is nailed on for another 12 months of being the least popular person at&nbsp;the cabinet table. For Starmer, though, the misery isn’t&nbsp;inevitable. Or at least, it might not be if he changed the way he operates, as most people try to at this time of&nbsp;year.One of the reasons Labour has managed to make governing look quite so hard is that both Starmer and Reeves are playing the bad cop at the moment. Good cop, bad cop is supposed to work as a negotiating tactic when one half of a partnership is negative and hostile while the other partner comes across as upbeat, friendly and encouraging. The bad cop is supposed to start the negotiating, and then the good cop sweeps in to appear as though they’re on the side of the person the pair are trying to win over.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Europe’s Franco-German engine: in need of a reboot | Editorial,"Over the holidays, this column will explore next year’s urgent issues. Today, Today, why Europe’s key alliance faces a troubling year amid political turmoilWhen Konrad Adenauer and Charles de Gaulle signed the 1963 Elysée treaty of friendship between France and Germany, it was a moving milestone on the road to postwar European integration. But Emmanuel Macron tends to avoid sentimental references to the Franco-German “couple” that made the modern EU possible. Ahead of 60th anniversary celebrations of the treaty last year, Mr Macron’s aides observed that, for the French president, “joint European action is a geopolitical necessity, not a romantic matter”.A touch dry and uninspirational perhaps. But a more coldly analytical approach suits the times. The Franco-German alliance was the indispensable force behind the creation of both the EU’s single market and the euro. But as Europe struggles to define its place in a multipolar and more threatening world, the bedrock partnership at its core is not what it was.

But during the many and various celebrations in 2025 that will mark the 250th anniversary of the birth of Jane Austen, others, it seems, are planning to take a rather more full-hearted approach. Be warned: there will be breeches.In Bath, where Austen took up residence in 1801, a series of costume balls are to be staged, one with a seaside theme inspired by the uncompleted Sanditon. At Chawton in Hampshire, where she lived with her mother and sister Cassandra from 1809, festivals will be devoted to Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Emma, the latter to include a Dress Up Day, should you happen to have a sprigged muslin gown hanging at the back of your wardrobe.

For an ailing and ageing Peter Wright, the only conceivable reality in which he could win this match existed in his own mind, and over 40 scintillating minutes he set about carving this vision into magnificent flesh.In a way, it was a vision dreamed up days in advance, when Humphries was still the king of the Palace and Wright was simply the washed up world No 17, and the possibility of this game barely registered.

 Darnold hit Jalen Nailor, Jordan Addison and Cam Akers for scores to raise his passing touchdown total to 35, the fourth-most in NFL history by a player in his debut season with a team.
 The Vikings (14-2) set up a final-week showdown in Detroit for both the NFC North title and the first-round-bye-plus-home-field-advantage package that comes with the best record in the conference.
 Jordan Love’s only touchdown pass for the Packers (11-5) came with 2:18 left, a 3-yard toss to Malik Heath that trimmed their deficit to two points and reignited the “Go Pack Go!” chants from the green-clad fans mixed in among the purple in another classic edition of this divisional rivalry.
 Despite another fierce climb out of a gaping hole against Minnesota this season, following a 31-29 loss in Green Bay on Sept. 29 that started with a 28-0 deficit, the Packers fell to a troubling 0-5 against the top three teams in the NFC.

It’s something that more or less all of us agree is a good idea – few people would confidently say “no thanks, I laugh too much actually, and if anything I need to cut down” (perhaps a particularly giggly funeral director). But how does one achieve such an aim? When the cost of living continues to squeeze us into oblivion? When we live in the age of enshittification?

The Guardian,The Order review – Jude Law tails white supremacists in brooding true crime drama,"The actor excels as an FBI agent hunting far-right terrorists in this solemn thriller based on real events in 1980s AmericaIn his film-making career, Australian director Justin Kurzel has dealt with murder sprees (Snowtown), massacres (Nitram), outlaws (True History of the Kelly Gang) and, in his latest picture, The Order, far-right domestic terror organisations in the US. But Kurzel is not drawn to crime for crime’s sake. Rather, he is fascinated by the context of it all – by the reverberations set in motion by an act of violence; by the links between atrocities past and those of the present. He pointedly draws parallels between the events explored in The Order, which unfolds in the Pacific Northwest of the early 1980s, and more recent actions such as the 6 January Capitol attack.This sober, factually based FBI procedural stars an excellent Jude Law, sporting standard issue US law enforcement paunch and moustache combo. The action starts with a spate of bank robberies. Careworn FBI agent Terry Husk (Law) suspects that there’s a link between the crimes and a burgeoning white nationalist movement in the region. What follows is a wary game of cat and mouse, with Husk tracking the charismatic leader of the underground militia, a wholesome, apple-cheeked farm boy named Bob Matthews (an impressive Nicholas Hoult), who is always a few steps ahead of the veteran FBI man on his tail.In UK and Irish cinemas Continue reading...","Sun, 29 Dec 2024 15:00:10 GMT",-0.3818,0.657

The show started life in 2018 at the Soho theatre in London and at the Edinburgh festival, a collaboration with his friend, director Adam Brace, who died last year aged 43. But Just for Us really exploded in the US, where this year it won Edelman a Tony and an Emmy and a place on the Time list of the 100 most influential people of 2024.

Shadow has rage issues, super speed and a gloomy emo-black colour palette. But in this frenetically empty sequel, cluttered with pinballing animated extraterrestrial varmints, the most cartoonish performance comes from a member of the human cast: Jim Carrey reprises his role as the villainous inventor Doctor Robotnik, and takes on a new character, Robotnik’s demented grandfather Gerald.While I had more time than many of my fellow critics for the two previous movie spin-offs from the Sega video game series, it turns out that you can, in fact, have too much of a good thing.

Exercises, sets, repetitions and rests – even the number of seconds I spent raising and lowering the weights was meticulously planned so I could more successfully chase my goals.In lots of ways, this wasn’t a bad thing. Having a proper plan for the gym can save a fair bit of mental bandwidth: you go in, you do what the Post-it note says.

How did this nascent national treasure turn trauma into triumph?There’s a stockpot simmering on Andi Oliver’s stove – for days, the broth has been bubbling. A mugful of the rib-sticking, rich elixir lands in front of me as I’m ushered into her east London kitchen from the cold. She ladles out a flask-full for Garfield, her boyfriend of 30 years, then peers into the saucepan. “I’ve not been well,” says Oliver, “and this has healed me.” She spent the past two months filming in Stratford-upon-Avon, where she always had a similar soup on the go. “It’s giving yourself the care you need. And sharing it with other people doesn’t just fix you, but briefly, the world around you.” Supplies depleted, she begins to rebuild the brew from its bones: pinches of cloves, juniper and star anise are dropped in. A glug of white wine. Taste, then season. No measurements, just instinct. “I started cooking young,” Oliver explains. “To me, it’s everyday magic. Giving you that broth is sharing a little bit of myself – a soul exchange.” Briefly, there’s a moment of serenity.Scout, the ageing family dog, comes in barking. The phone rings, twice. Unidentified clattering upstairs. Hers is a house that’s lived in. “Just to flag,” Oliver warns, “anyone might just appear. This place is like Piccadilly Circus.” A steady stream of people do wander through. First, Kelly, close colleague and confidante. Garfield next. Then Oliver’s mum pootles through, nonplussed by a stranger’s presence. Soon to turn 88, she moved in a couple of years back. “Oh, and that’s Amanda Mealing,” Oliver says, as the former Holby City star pops her head around the door. “We met doing a play with Paul O’Grady – Lily Savage was one of her son’s godmothers, and I’m the other one.” There might be other houseguests, Oliver can’t be certain.

The Guardian,From climate denial to gothic movies to ‘treat culture’ … what to expect in 2025,"The new US president will almost certainly bring unpredictability but several themes will dominate the year ahead. Observer writers offer their guide on what lies ahead in politics, film, fashion, sport and moreThe only thing that can be predicted with absolute certainty about Donald Trump’s second term as US president is that it will be unpredictable. Trump does not really know what he wants to do on a range of issues. He talks a good game, which is how he got re-elected. But he often seems to decide policy on the basis of what the last person he spoke to told him. Is he serious about mobilising the military to carry out mass deportations of “illegal” migrants? Will he use the justice department to hunt down political enemies and media critics? Will he impose sweeping tariffs on foreign imports and trigger a&nbsp;global trade war? Or will he act with greater circumspection, using these threats as bargaining tools? Who knows? He&nbsp;doesn’t yet. Continue reading...","Sun, 29 Dec 2024 05:00:03 GMT",0.0,-0.8503
The Guardian,"Kieran Culkin on pranks, parenting and why his famous family doesn’t need therapy: ‘Us siblings, we’re already cooked’","He’s been on screen since he was seven – but only prepares for a scene 10 minutes before. Yet somehow the mischievous Succession star is now tipped for an Oscar. How did the chaotic, charismatic actor do it?Kieran Culkin tries the upright chair first, the one opposite me, high-backed and leather. But no, that’s no good. He can see his reflection in the wall mirror, he’ll be catching himself all interview, thinking how tired he looks with his hooded eyes and beard, how jet&nbsp;lagged. Sleep is always tricky, but he’s been up with the kids – five and three – who weren’t supposed to join him for this publicity tour but there was a last-minute crisis, the short version of which is that the whole family is over from New York (with Culkin, 42, there’s always a long and short version).So, he flumps on the banquette, where he’ll be facing guests drinking afternoon cocktails in the low-lit, high-ceilinged bar here at the Corinthia hotel in London. He tests the firmness of the upholstery. Pantomimes boneless relaxation. Looks at me to gauge the distance between us. No, this won’t do, either. He’s too low, these people are distracting and, proximity-wise, he’s a little close. He scrambles back to the chair. Grabs the drinks menu. Muses that you may as well have the expensive thing if you’re not paying, orders champagne plus whatever trimmings, strains to peek at my notes. “Your fun notes. Notes I am not allowed to see.” He taps his phone screen, “OK, your time starts … now.” Cackles like a cartoon villain. “Yeah, just kidding.” Continue reading...","Sat, 28 Dec 2024 10:00:35 GMT",0.0,-0.9365

The Guardian,"The big picture: Colleen Kenyon’s new year portrait of her twin sister, 1977","The late feminist artists explored ideas of doubling and twinship, as well as helping to redefine notions of craft skillsThe photographer Colleen Kenyon made this new year portrait of her identical twin sister Kathleen in 1977. At the time the two of them were embarking on a shared artistic journey that put them at the forefront of feminist artists interested in reclaiming and redefining “craft” skills, using photomontage and hand-colouring techniques to celebrate and ironise traditionally “domestic” artistic expression, such as scrapbooking. Over the subsequent 25 years the twins, born in 1951, pursued this practice at the Center for Photography at Woodstock in upstate New York, where Colleen became executive director in 1981 and her sister joined her as associate director. Together they developed the exhibition space and a programme of workshops to make the institution a prime mover in the advancement of women in the arts, and for artists of colour.Their own distinctive photographic ideas developed both individually and in tandem in those years. Colleen focused on intricate print-making techniques and delicate hand-colouring of female portraits, while Kathleen pursued her interest in collage, often manipulating mass-produced images of women to give them a pointed comic or political edge. Frequently, the sisters explored ideas of doubling and twinship – their academic parents had dressed them identically until they were 10, before they each insisted on making their own fashion choices – and their art examines their shared genetics and discrete characters in multiple ways.

In his ever-growing collection of ceramic blue plaques, created with the assistance of ceramicist Caroline Tattersall, he celebrates people who have meant something to him – family members, friends, TV personalities and musicians – focusing on life’s central milestones: births, marriages and deaths. “I feel happy with making the plaques,” says Lindezey. “I roll the clay on to the mould, paint it white, then I put the letters on it. I like showing them in exhibitions, in Blackburn and London. I like to see them out there – they are nice memories of some people that have died.”A limited edition book of The Blue Plaques (£25), signed by the artist, is available at venturearts.org Continue reading...","Sat, 28 Dec 2024 17:00:43 GMT",0.0,0.9545

Their boy, Miles, was six months old at the time.“As I was taking him inside, I saw the reflection of my son’s back rolls in the glass door.” Ostrander grabbed his iPhone 14 Pro and turned the front camera on. “He was teething back then; not crying, but not his usual pleasant self either.
