The Guardian,Hot Milk review – Fiona Shaw a fierce fly in simmering erotic soup,"A cantankerous Shaw undercuts her daughter’s summer sexual awakening in this interestingly elusive adaptation of Deborah Levy’s novelDramatist and film-maker Rebecca Lenkiewicz presents Berlin with a complicated, interestingly elusive Valentine’s Day present: her adaptation of Deborah Levy’s 2016 novel Hot Milk, which appears to anaesthetise emotional pain with the sensual languour of a summer sexual awakening, that title perhaps alluding to the overheated, unwholesome quality of the mother’s milk metaphorically involved in a parent-child relationship. Or perhaps it ironically inverts the idea of a placidly bedtime drink of northern climes, which is of no earthly interest in the film’s passionately sunny, southern European settings.Fiona Shaw gives an excellent performance as Rose – querulous, cantankerous, witty – an Irish woman in her 60s using a wheelchair due to some mysterious ailment or psychosomatic condition. If it is the second, what is the cause? She has brought along her twentysomething daughter Sofia (Emma Mackey) with her on a trip to Spain where as a desperate last resort, she is going to consult an expensive private consultant Dr Gomez (Vincent Perez) about the debilitating pains in her bones and joints.

The Guardian,Funboys review – some of the most fearless comedy in years,"This utterly idiosyncratic sitcom about young men in smalltown Northern Ireland has hints of This Country – but with a pedalo-based masturbation scene that is unspeakably, brilliantly awfulLike so many great comedies, Funboys is an idiosyncratic, gently nurtured, quietly horrific thing. The creation of RyanDylan and Rian Lennon, who also play two of its main characters, it began life as a 14-minute film – small but perfectly formed – that premiered at the BBC Two comedy festival two years ago. Now, with cast nicely broadened and content nicely deepened, it has become a series. We follow the three “emotionally unassembled” twentysomethings – Callum Brown (Dylan), Jordan McCafferty (Lennon) and Lorcan Boggin (Lee R James) – whose earnestness belies their self-chosen funboys moniker, as they attempt to assemble and entertain themselves with the sparse resources on offer in the tiny town of Ballymacnoose, Northern Ireland.Callum is no longer engaged to his ultra-religious fiancee Morgan (Emer O’Connor), but the gang is disturbed and astonished when an English girl, Gemma (Ele McKenzie), arrives in town and promptly makes Callum her boyfriend. “Strong, rugged, good-looking,” she tells him. “I’m sick of that rubbish.” Jordan quickly gets very drunk to cope with his friend’s absence from their group gaming sessions. “I’m worried about Callum’s post-nut depression,” he insists. “I don’t want that for you, Callum.” Continue reading...","Fri, 14 Feb 2025 22:25:19 GMT",0.7159,0.9872

Its creator and star talk wigs, unfinished business – and what it’s really like being queer in Jamaica todayYou’ve probably never met anyone quite like Millie Black, the detective protagonist of a new Jamaica-set crime thriller. But Marlon James has. James is the acclaimed author of five novels, including 2014’s Booker prize winner, A Brief History of Seven Killings, and now he’s making the move into television, as Get Millie Black’s creator – with a disputed source of inspiration. “I keep telling my mother it is not based on her! She thinks I’m in denial,” he tells me down the line from his art-filled Brooklyn apartment.James’s mother, Shirley Dillon-James, was “a pioneer”, he admits: one of the first women to make detective in 1950s Jamaica, “so she was basically working for the queen. She dealt with colonialism, sexism, all of that stuff.” Jamaica gained independence from the UK in 1962, but the “colonialism” and “sexism” parts still figure for Millie Black as she negotiates a career begun in London’s Metropolitan Police, and now transferred to the Kingston Central Division. But also: “Millie may be more influenced by me than by my mom,” says James. “In the sense that I’ve always looked at writing as a form of detective work. It’s always been, how am I gonna solve this mystery?” Continue reading...","Fri, 14 Feb 2025 13:00:08 GMT",-0.2732,0.9779
The Guardian,"Ah, here’s Trump’s peace plan for Ukraine – or rather, a plan to leave it in pieces | Marina Hyde","And despite having ample time to prepare for this moment, why do Europe and Britain’s leaders seem so surprised?In the wake of Donald Trump’s decision to instigate his Ukraine “peace plan”, it’s great to hear from US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, that “everything is on the table”. Also: would President Putin like to keep the table? I get the feeling that Hegseth would be very willing to throw in the table, which is likely to be hewn by Saudi craftsmen. That’s not a bone-saw euphemism: Trump says the putative peace talks could be hosted by the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. For now, the world had to settle for Hegseth popping into a Nato defence ministers meeting in Brussels to announce: “Make no mistake, President Trump will not allow anyone to turn Uncle Sam into Uncle Sucker.” So this week offered an opportunity to watch Eisenhower quotes get Disneyfied by a defence secretary with a Crusades tattoo. Good times!Anyway: the peace plan. I expect this lesson is contained in Trump’s seminal business text, The Art of the Deal, but one fairly reliable principle of negotiation is that if you say a number first, you end up negotiating down from it. If you get the other side to say a number first, you can negotiate up from that. For whatever reason, and supposedly before formal negotiations have even begun, Hegseth has already effectively surrendered most or all of the land taken by Russia since 2014, the possibility of Ukraine joining Nato, and the threat of any future European security being guaranteed by the US. I image Vladimir Putin will simply accept the terms by pointing at him and saying, “You’re hired!” Continue reading...","Fri, 14 Feb 2025 13:57:00 GMT",0.5106,0.96
The Guardian,"In Israel, dread and rage haunt the streets. Netanyahu is exploiting that | Jonathan Freedland","When I visited Israel this week, it seemed time had stood still since 7 October. I saw pain and grief, but little sign of hopeYou could give Donald Trump that Nobel peace prize right now. For a few days, he succeeded in uniting Palestinians and Israelis, though not quite in the way favoured by the judging panel in Norway. Instead, he had both sides holding their breath, hoping he was not about to destroy the closest thing to hope they have known in 16 months.I am referring to the deal done nearly four weeks ago which has allowed for a ceasefire in Gaza, along with the phased release of hostages held by Hamas and prisoners held by Israel. It was always perilously fragile, but this week it looked to be on the brink of collapse. First came a Hamas threat to postpone the next release of three hostages, due tomorrow, in response to alleged Israeli violations of the ceasefire. Then Trump weighed in, saying that he no longer liked the deal brokered by the Biden administration anyway, that he’d had enough of hostages freed “in dribs and drabs” and wanted all of them out in one go, by noon Saturday. Otherwise, he said, “all hell is going to break out”.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Fri, 14 Feb 2025 17:45:54 GMT",-0.9042,-0.6455

The Guardian,Trump chairing a major arts institution would be laughable if it weren’t so deeply troubling | Charlotte Higgins,"Jokes about the president’s power grab at the Kennedy Center in Washington soon pale. This is a nakedly authoritarian moveDonald Trump’s announcement that he was installing himself as the chair of the John F Kennedy Center, Washington DC’s temple to the performing arts, might have been mistaken for something petty or trivial – another random, Pollock-esque splatter of the policy paintbrush against the canvas of the world. On his favoured social media site he posted an image, presumably AI-generated, of himself as a dinner-jacketed orchestral conductor – the macho maestro of the US. But this is more than personal: it is political, and points towards the president’s wider project.To understand what is going on, it is necessary to consider Trump’s favourite European authoritarian, Viktor Orbán. Hungary’s prime minister has chipped away at his country’s constitution and judiciary. But a no less powerful tool has been his attention to parts of society often regarded as unimportant compared with a country’s constitution. Alongside crushing independent media, Orbán’s government has co-opted the arts, appointing right-leaning directors to theatres, and instigating nationalist art exhibitions. Orbán understands that culture creates the climate for emotion and memory, imprints national myths, and – often intangibly – acts on politics.Charlotte Higgins is the Guardian’s chief culture writer Continue reading...","Fri, 14 Feb 2025 14:30:10 GMT",-0.5956,-0.7148
The Guardian,"That new land use policy that the Tories call ‘national suicide’? It’s urgent, essential – and their idea | Henry Dimbleby","No, it isn’t a leftwing plot, it’s a proposal I authored for the Conservatives in 2021. And it could be brilliantly transformative for EnglandLast week saw the launch of what could be – if done right – the most important political policy in a generation. You may not have heard about the new land use framework, but if you did hear something, chances are it wasn’t good. “National suicide!” declared the shadow farming minister, Robbie Moore, who described the policy for good measure as “food lunacy”.I should confess that I am the original author of this lunacy. It was one of the key recommendations of the 2021 National Food Strategy – an independent review I was commissioned to write by the then Tory government. The purpose of the land use framework was – is – sane enough. It is intended to inform and streamline planning decisions and steer other government incentives, to ensure that areas of land are used in ways they are naturally well suited to.

The Guardian,Trump called the press ‘the enemy of the people’. Now it’s time to defend ourselves | Jodie Ginsberg,"The one-time defiance and solidarity of publications across the political aisle is strained as outlets cave to Trump’s threatsIn 1971, the Nixon administration asked for a court order to stop the New York Times from publishing further stories about the so-called Pentagon Papers – documents that showed the US government had escalated its Vietnam war efforts even as it was acknowledging privately that it could not win the war. A temporary restraining order – the first time the US press had been restrained prior to publication – was granted.Knowing she could be sued, jailed and could even have faced financial ruin if her own paper followed suit, the Washington Post’s publisher, Katharine Graham, decided that the Post, which had copies of some of the Pentagon Papers, would publish anyway. As immortalised in the 2017 film The Post, Graham – who had previously described herself as shy and insecure – took a deep breath and told her editors: “Let’s go. Let’s publish!” Continue reading...","Fri, 14 Feb 2025 11:00:06 GMT",-0.5423,-0.956
The Guardian,The Guardian view on supporting vaccines: humans can work miracles – so why wouldn’t we? | Editorial,"Global immunisation programmes are under risk as the US slashes its aid programme and the UK considers cutting fundingIt is easy to become so used to scientific and social advances that we take them for granted. But sometimes we should pause to celebrate – to feel genuine awe – at the wonders that we have seen. Amid&nbsp;all the wars, the disasters and the crimes of the&nbsp;last half century, we have witnessed nothing short&nbsp;of a miracle.Vaccination, in addition to clean water, sanitation and improved nutrition, has been one of the greatest contributors to global health. It is responsible for much of the astounding fall in child mortality, which plummeted by 59% between 1990 and 2022. It has saved more than 150 million lives, mostly of infants, since the Expanded Programme on Immunisation was launched by the World Health Organization in 1974. Initially designed to protect children against diseases including smallpox, tuberculosis, polio and measles, the scheme has since been extended to cover more pathogens. Then, in 2000, came the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi), a public-private organisation&nbsp;that provides financial and technical support for vaccination in poorer countries and negotiates with manufacturers to lower costs.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on film awards: and the winner is… | Editorial,"Getting rid of separate best actor and best actress categories is not the answer to lack of diversity in the industryThe Guardian style guide advises writers to use the term “actor” regardless of the performer’s identity: “avoid actress except when in name of award, eg Oscar for best actress”. As the awards season is upon us, this instruction goes to the heart of a question that has been asked behind the scenes – should we still have separate best actor and actress categories? Or are they exclusionary and outdated? There’s no Academy award for best female sound engineer.Last year, Variety magazine reported that the Academy was considering eliminating the separate awards, following the example of the Grammys in 2012 and other film and TV honours since, but that this was still in early “exploration”. The arguments in favour are that this would put male and female actors on an equal footing and include non-binary actors. The&nbsp;case against is the danger of fewer or no women at all being nominated: the Brits’ decision to combine the best solo&nbsp;artist awards in 2022 was immediately followed by&nbsp;an all-male shortlist.

The Guardian,UFOs have earned a new name – and should be objects of serious study | Letters,"At least some sightings of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) may relate to non-human intelligence, says Prof Michael Bohlander. Plus, letters from Andrew Robinson and Aideen CartyMuch as in the US, with the recent congressional hearings on unidentified anomalous phenomena, the UK government is apparently less than transparent in its handling of UAP sightings (formerly called UFOs) – as your article about the Calvine photo shows (What really happened in Calvine? The mystery behind the best UFO picture ever seen, G2, 11 February). And, as in the US, any hope for imminent and trustworthy disclosure about what these objects may be is probably futile.Those who do not a priori consider this topic ludicrous, or exploit it in a sensationalist manner, are increasingly taking a more nuanced and independent approach. If there are such phenomena, it stands to reason that they can and should be studied with the necessary rigour. Continue reading...","Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:23:24 GMT",-0.0772,0.8979
The Guardian,Fantasy fiction doesn’t need reclaiming for women – they already write and read it | Letters,"Responding to an editorial about the surge in romantasy books, James Latimer writes that romance isn’t only for girls, and Yvonne Williams talks about the synergy of dragons and sexI was disappointed to read your view on romantasy fiction (Editorial, 7 February), which seemed to imply that the fantasy genre needed reclaiming for women. This does a huge disservice to the many excellent female fantasy authors – some recent, some around for decades – who have been a mainstay of the genre despite not writing romance or teen fiction.These women do not seem to get the recognition, and readership, that they deserve – despite some, such as NK Jemisin, Ann Leckie, Charlie Jane Anders, RF Kuang or Martha Wells, dominating genre awards. These authors also have to fight the continual misperception that&nbsp;they&nbsp;only write romantic or young adult fiction, which is exactly the fantasy that your article perpetuates. And this also erases all&nbsp;the female fantasy readers who are not (solely) here for the romantasy, and have always been here. Continue reading...","Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:22:32 GMT",0.0,0.8697

Her England place at risk, the 27-year-old desperately needed minutes, and a move was the only option. On the evening of 29 January, less than 24 hours before the transfer window shut, Kelly went public on social media regarding her frustration at City dictating “whom I can and can’t join”.

Having escaped a violent and heavy-drinking father, Mary Wollstonecraft ploughed a singular path. Avowedly independent and radical in thought, she dazzled and discombobulated a crusty male establishment with her intellect. She turned from governess to author and landed a reporting job in revolutionary France. Among her works, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman is a foundational feminist text. After that, giving birth to Mary Shelley seems like a postscript.Maureen Lennon’s patchwork tribute for Hull Truck and Pilot theatre is a musical collage of fast-paced scenes designed to memorialise a pioneer of sexual equality. As Lennon has it, this is a woman who demands parity with men, radicalises children and refuses to be shouted down. The play is “told for all women who find themselves howling at the world”.

All are painted on panels with rounded corners – no frame is enclosing these women.Working from staged photographs and found images, Thomas’s compositions are hymns to excess. Figures emerge in fragments from layers of pattern, like the swirling kimonos that unfurl to reveal body parts in Japanese woodcuts. The bodies themselves are radically flattened, rendered in simplified graphic forms like Tom Wesselmann’s Great American Nudes of the 1960s. Yet unlike those nudes, Thomas’s figures have names, and eyes, and agency. Posed naked on a couch covered in florals and animal prints, the woman in A Little Taste Outside of Love (2007) is identified as the artist’s ex-girlfriend Maya.

The Guardian,The Guide #178: How AI took over the commercial break,"In this week’s newsletter: Usually, we’d rather make a cup of tea when the ads come on, but the Super Bowl slew of A-listers flogging AI products smacks of desperate PRThe Guide doesn’t tend to focus on adverts very often. We’re usually more interested in the popular culture those commercials are busy rudely interrupting. Besides, complaining about the most annoying ones – like the Confused.com ad where a succession of people squeeze the mouths into a disgusting O-shape and mime whistling for reasons unknown – only affords them the attention they crave. My primary life ambition is to live in a world where they stop making the Domino-hoo-hoo ads, so I’m hoping that ignoring them may help make that utopia a reality.Still, sometimes it is worth paying attention in the ad breaks. After all, the best examples – Ridley Scott’s 1984-riffing Apple spot, say, or Jonathan Glazer’s Guinness ad – elevate the form to something close to art. Great ads tend to linger in the collective imagination, serving as shorthand for the era they belong to. Even when the ads aren’t coming close to doing that, they can still tell us something interesting about what messages our capitalist overlords are trying to get us to swallow. And if you have been paying attention to ad breaks over the past few months, you’ll likely have noticed a recurring message: artificial intelligence, far from being the thing that will ultimately turn society in to a giant pool of grey goo, is actually your friend.

Here are my favourites for beating the cold,"Keep out the chill for longer with a new breed of thermal swimsuits designed for cold-water swimming, tested and rated by our expert• ‘The best way to beat face freeze’: 15 wild swimming essentialsFor those brave enough to swim outdoors in winter, there have, until recently, been two options: wear an ordinary swimsuit and feel the thrill/horror of cold water on your skin for a few minutes; or pull on a wetsuit and stay in for longer, but without the endorphin high.But there is now a third way: a cold-water swimsuit, made from thermal fabric to keep your core warmer for longer and lengthen your time in the water. A wetsuit may seem the obvious choice for winter swimming, but many open-water wetsuits won’t offer much warmth in water below 10C, and the effort of putting one on at this time of year when swims are short often isn’t worth it (see more detail below). But is a cold-water swimsuit any different from a standard suit, and are they worth buying? I tested seven of the best to find out.Best overall cold-water swimsuit:

In particular, the pair of boot-cut jeans worn by the American rapper as he commanded the stage. But while those came from the luxury fashion brand Celine and cost £830, the scores of backup dancers surrounding him wore a high street label – to be precise, £19.90 oversized T-shirts and long-sleeved tops from Uniqlo.It is another big coup for the Japanese-founded retailer that has steadily grown its presence on the British high street with 20 stores and counting. For a brand previously seen as a little boring, all beige and greige logoless casual wear, it is quite the vibe shift.

No, it’s “a journey of the senses”, over tandoori duck seekh kebab, sea bass pollichathu and a few fancy cocktails, to help you transcend your earthly confines. This is “more than just a meal; it’s an ascent to new experiences”, proclaims the website.Being a huge fan of restaurant hyperbole, I love it when dinner promises to change me metaphysically. The website goes on to refer to Vatavaran’s owners, chef Rohit Ghai and Abhishake Sangwan, as “visionary”, and in doing so strays perilously close to David Icke territory. Elsewhere on the site, Himalayan analogies are stretched like climbing ropes off the side of Nanda Devi: the show kitchen private dining room, we are told, is “a dynamic, participatory journey through the flavours of the mountains”, but I’d rather not – PDRs are the last refuge of the scoundrel, after all.
