The findings expose weaknesses in the Lords code of conduct and raise questions about whether the rules on lobbying and paid employment should be tightened in line with restrictions signed up to by MPs.Nearly 100 members of the Lords are paid to give political or policy advice by commercial firms.A Labour peer offered access to ministers during discussions to sponsor an event in parliament.A former minister has earned millions of pounds since entering the Lords by working for 30 companies.Multiple peers are being paid by foreign governments including repressive regimes.More than £1 in every £14 donated to political parties since 2001 came from those who have sat as peers in the last parliament.

Where would a series like this begin? The formation of Hamas? The six-day war? Suez? 1948? 1917? Earlier?The producer of this film, Norma Percy, has taken a more modern approach. Percy’s strongest skill as a documentary-maker has always been her ability to secure access to the people who matter, such as Gerald Ford for 1994’s Watergate series and Slobodan Milošević for 1995’s The Death of Yugoslavia. Given that the authors of the Balfour declaration – a letter written by the British government in 1917 supporting the creation of a Jewish homeland – are all long dead, Percy has decided to venture back only two decades.

The Guardian,‘They now put trigger warnings on Hi-de-Hi!’ Jeffrey Holland on starring in British comedy classics,"He was Spike the gormless comic in the holiday camp hit and also bagged roles in You Rang M’Lord? and Dad’s Army. As he publishes a memoir, Holland talks about frisky stallions, today’s ‘over-sensitive’ era – and being huge in HungaryTo the general showbiz warning about never acting with animals, Jeffrey Holland has a specific footnote to add about equine erections. While filming Hi-de-Hi!, the 1980s BBC sitcom set in a holiday camp, Holland one day found himself playing the front half of a pantomime horse, with co-star Su Pollard in the rear. The visual gag was that the rag nag ends up riding a real one. “So the horse had to be in the scene,” recalls Holland. “But it took rather an interest in the pantomime one and started sniffing around its hindquarters. Su said words to the effect of, ‘Oh, eck!’ and asked for help. But I’m afraid all I could say was, ‘You’d better brace yourself, Su. I’m going to eat some grass!’”A horseman on set diverted the randy stallion, but the incident triggered a flashback for Holland. A panto he once appeared in included a Coventry production with real horses. One would become aroused as soon as it walked on stage, forcing the director to place an actor with a large flag between it and the audience. “Apparently, it was responding to a perfume an actress was wearing,” Holland recalls – and being careful with scent around mounts is one of the many useful tips for younger performers contained in Holland’s new memoir, The First Rule of Comedy ..!

The Guardian,"Starmer has the backing of Britons to stand up to Trumpism. At the White House, he should do so | Polly Toynbee","The PM will not and should not pick a fight with the president. But it is his duty to go there upholding British and European valuesDay by day another vast hole opens up beneath what was once solid. The man who is on course to become Germany’s next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, once the most pro-US of leaders, has declared Nato in effect over. In his clear-eyed perception of Donald Trump’s first month, 80 years of shared transatlantic values have fallen into that crater. The US “doesn’t care about the fate of Europe one way or another” and Washington’s actions have been “no less drastic, dramatic, and ultimately no less brazen” than Moscow’s, he said. Now, Europe must defend itself.The moment smacks of that 1940 David Low cartoon of a British soldier standing on a rock in a stormy sea, shaking his fist as the Luftwaffe approach: “Very well, alone”. But this time we Europeans are alone. JD Vance, the US vice-president, declared war on European values and traditions; Europe’s liberal “enemies within” are more dangerous in his eyes than Russia or China. Those spell-breaking words told Europeans that the US can never be trusted again; at any time, Americans may vote for a leader who betrays old allies, sharing no affinity with Europe’s liberal democracies, international rights or laws. “The west” no longer exists as an entity bound by shared beliefs.

The Guardian,The fight at the heart of the German election is simmering everywhere  | Zoe Williams,"In all similar democracies, left and right are having versions of the same argument: does ‘electable’ mean centrist or radical?As the German election results land, a lot of people are looking on the bright side: nearly 80% of Germans won’t entertain voting for Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). A nanosecond ago, however – as recently as Saturday – the idea that voters might go this far-right, in these kinds of numbers, for the first time since the second world war was terrifying. Some are calling this a victory over Donald Trump and Elon Musk, who vocally supported the AfD; others are calling it a victory for them.Nobody is puzzling much over the decline in support for Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic party – down 9%, almost equal to the AfD’s gains, although the numbers on switchers have yet to be crunched – because it was so long expected. The CDU/CSU alliance has won, with 28.5%, pretty much as the polls predicted. It’s an incredibly German story in its labyrinthine and laborious coalition possibilities, but it’s also a common story these days. The two main parties hand power to one another in a kind of disillusionment relay; the populist right gets a dispiritingly good show; the populist or eco left is less populist, less popular, and can pick a fight with itself in a paper bag, so it looks even smaller than it is.

The Guardian,How do I know young women are not OK? Their devastation over a doomed anglerfish | Emma Beddington,"The death of one of the sea’s uglier creatures has led to an outpouring online. What is it about this unfortunate creature that has evoked such big feelings?Here’s an unexpected addition to our 2025 bingo card: young women across the internet have been devastated by the demise of a nightmarish fanged fish. A black seadevil anglerfish (unflatteringly described by one marine biologist as “pretty much evolved to be a giant head”), usually a deep-sea dweller, was recently caught on camera swimming close to the surface by a shark research group near Tenerife. Sadly, apparently sick or injured, it died.This, however, was only the start of the anglerfish’s journey in the hearts and TikToks of young women. The fish’s story has triggered an outpouring of emotion. The narrative they have adopted is that the tiny anglerfish, who lived her life in darkness, wanted to feel the “sun on her face”, so swam alone through the vast ocean to do that before expiring. There have been tattoos, poetry and oceans of tears. “If you have a girlfriend right now, do yourself a favour and go ask her how she’s feeling about the anglerfish,” wrote one TikTok user. “There is a 98% chance she has already bawled her eyes out about it.” Continue reading...","Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:00:53 GMT",-0.4344,-0.9561
The Guardian,There is a clear Trump doctrine. Those who can’t see it won't have a say in reshaping the world | Nesrine Malik,"The sooner the US’s former friends realise the old global order is over, the sooner they can organise to regain power and agency – the only language Trump understandsA resonant phrase during Donald Trump’s first administration was the advice to take him “seriously, but not literally”. It was a singularly detrimental expression, widely quoted by politicians and the media. Its adoption fit with the position many felt most comfortable taking: Trump was bad, but he wasn’t smart. He wasn’t intentional. He wasn’t calculated and deliberate. He sounded off, but rarely followed up with action. He was in essence a misfiring weapon that could do serious damage, but mostly by accident.The residue of that approach still persists, even in analysis that describes Trump’s first executive orders as a campaign of “shock and awe”, as if it were just a matter of signalling rather than executing.

But Trump is “the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military in the world … if I can’t take the words of the president of the United States to actually mean something, rather than needing some type of oracle to be able to explain, I just don’t know what to think about when it comes to our national security.”Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Mon, 24 Feb 2025 06:00:06 GMT",0.3818,0.6629
The Guardian,Putin plays the long game. He has punished Ukraine – and he won’t stop there | Yaroslav Hrytsak,"Like a judo master, the Russian aggressor wears down his opponents until they break. Then he comes back for moreI have a friend, an American author, who writes about war. Over the past decades, he has been to South Sudan, Rwanda, Congo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Gaza and other conflict zones. In the case of Ukraine, he said one thing stood out: here it was obvious who was the aggressor and who was the victim. Alongside Bosnia, Ukraine’s resistance to Russia remains, in his opinion, one of two truly just wars.After three years of fighting a just war against Putin’s aggression, we are now facing, with Donald Trump, an unjust peace. Ukraine will lose lands and will not receive compensation for its losses. War crimes will go unpunished and Ukrainians will not be provided with the security guarantees needed to protect them from future Russian attack.Yaroslav Hrytsak is a historian and professor at the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv Continue reading...","Mon, 24 Feb 2025 07:00:04 GMT",-0.4939,-0.9477
The Guardian,The Guardian view on Germany’s election result: Merz’s task is formidable | Editorial,"The victorious CDU leader is likely to be more proactive on the European stage. He will also need to forge broad alliances at home to see off the far rightFriedrich Merz, the leader of Germany’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union party (CDU), has a reputation for being blunt. On Sunday evening, as it became clear that the CDU had won the snap election triggered by the outgoing Social Democrat chancellor, Olaf Scholz, he did not disappoint. “For me,” said Mr&nbsp;Merz in a post-election television debate, “the absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA.”As recently as a fortnight ago, such a statement from a German chancellor-elect would have been inconceivable. But these are new and extraordinary times. A convinced transatlanticist, Mr Merz has previously played down the dangers to western unity posed by Donald Trump. But crude electioneering on behalf of the extreme right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) by the US president’s outriders, and the sidelining of Europe and Kyiv from negotiations over the future of Ukraine, have forced a handbrake turn.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now is the time for a rethinkIt’s a seductive promise: let our computers scrape the internet for ideas, images, forms of words, stories, music, jokes … and our industry will make your country rich. For a UK government desperate for economic growth, the demands of tech companies for copyright laws to be relaxed – in order that their artificial intelligence (AI) systems can access as much&nbsp;online content as possible without having to pay&nbsp;or seek permission – have been hard to resist. The US and China are the global leaders of this new tech race. But the UK has a chance to compete that ministers&nbsp;are desperate not&nbsp;to&nbsp;miss.To AI businesses, copyright is an irritant. Three years ago, it appeared that their lobbyists were on the verge of getting their way when a government agency, the Intellectual Property Office, recommended an exemption for data mining.

First, finding an alternative to the use of prison-based remand; second, keeping non-violent criminals in a restrictive regime outside prison; third, serious study into recidivism, and finally, improving the literacy of those entering prison for the first time.For 20 years I was responsible for education provision in the five Lancashire prisons.

The Guardian,France’s role in upholding the rules-based international order – and its failure to do so | Letters,"Dr Paula Gutlove applauds the French foreign minister’s views on shared global values and goals, but Dr Alexandra Hofer points out France’s double standardsJean-Noël Barrot, France’s foreign minister, argues persuasively that the major dividing line in international affairs today “is the one that separates those that support the international rules-based order from the rest” (The key global issue is not the clash of north and south, 20 February). The order that Barrot refers to is an intricate web of international agreements and cooperative practices set in place since the second world war. The United States has claimed leadership of this order, and did contribute to its creation. Sadly, however, the US has undermined this order from the beginning and, under the Trump administration, openly seeks to destroy it.Humanity created this order in response to painfully acquired lessons about power. We know that a competitive, “power-over” approach to world affairs creates instability and inflicts great suffering. Moreover, in a world of nuclear weapons, new technologies and ecological stresses, continued pursuit of power-over poses an existential threat to human civilisation. By contrast, the rules-based order calls for a collaborative, “power-with” approach. Using that approach, we can build global human security and nurture Earth’s interdependent life-support systems, allowing us to thrive for generations to come.

Crisis? What crisis? It was not so long ago that the Rugby Football Union was wringing its hands at the dearth of tightheads across the country but quietly, under the radar, Stuart has emerged as England’s most consistent, reliable performer.During Steve Borthwick’s first Six Nations in charge two years ago, he lamented that England were “not good at anything” and raised particular concern over the scrum, an area in which they had ranked last of all tier-one nations over the previous 12 months. Fast-forward to now and, under the tutelage of Tom Harrison, England’s scrum has developed into both a solid platform and a weapon they can employ to impressive effect.

The Guardian,A sense of acquiescence has pervaded Arsenal’s stuttering title challenge | Jonathan Wilson,"Mikel Arteta’s team have suffered unfortunate injuries but they also have far less self-belief than a Liverpool side who look destined to win the Premier LeagueSign up for Soccer with Jonathan Wilson hereAnd with that, surely, the title race is over. Liverpool had drawn four of their previous eight games which had created an opening. Had Arsenal beaten West Ham and Liverpool lost at Manchester City this weekend, the title would have been in Arsenal’s hands, at least to the extent that they would have won it if they had won every game they had remaining this season, including away at Liverpool. But, after Arsenal limped to a 1-0 defeat, Liverpool produced their best performance in weeks to win 2-0. The gap is 11 points and, even though Arsenal have a game in hand, it’s very hard to imagine either Liverpool dropping sufficient points or Arsenal winning enough for that to be overturned.Arteta described himself as “very, very angry” after his side’s defeat, admitting they were “nowhere near the levels that we have to hit to have the opportunity to win the Premier League”. But there’s been an element of that all season. This was only Arsenal’s third league defeat of the campaign, but there has been something distinctly underwhelming about them. Too many points have been frittered too cheaply. Too often they have failed to grasp chances. And too often ill-discipline has let them down.

According to TLC, the show will demonstrate “what life is really like for the Baldwins – chaotic, funny, exhausting and filled with love. Alec and Hilaria’s dynamic as a couple will also take centre stage, with moments that showcase their deep partnership as they navigate challenges hand in hand.” Which, given that it is still not long since Alec Baldwin fatally shot Halyna Hutchins on the set of Rust, is quite a lot of challenges.But however you view The Baldwins – either as a moneymaking necessity for a family in trouble, or something less edifying – they now join a long line of other reality show families that have opened themselves up for the public to gawp at.

The Guardian,Why Anora should win the best picture Oscar,"Mikey Madison’s  open-spirited performance as a lapdancer who falls for a feckless young client ignites a film brimful of heart, and we ought to return the loveWhen future historians look back at this year’s crop of Oscar nominees and ask what the world was like in 2024, what will they learn? Maybe that we’d had enough of reality, thanks. It’s telling that nine out of the 10 nominees are essentially set in the past, or in isolated or fantasy realms, from 1960s America (A Complete Unknown, Nickel Boys) to “Mexico” (Emilia Pérez, filmed in France), from Wicked’s Oz to Dune: Part Two’s Arrakis. Only one entry is set in genuine, here-and-now, modern-day society. What’s more, Anora goes to places mainstream cinema rarely does: the grubby streets, the strip clubs, the all-night cafes, off-season Brighton Beach in Brooklyn and the Russian and Armenian communities who live there. Anora also gives us the opposite: gated mansions, deluxe hotel suites, private jets. That’s the kind of film it is; that’s the kind of world we live in.But the main reason Anora should win is that it’s simply an adorable film – full of heart and passion and energy and just life. It’s impossible not to be swept along with its hero, Ani – a gutsy but tragically naive lapdancer who falls for a Russian oligarch’s spoilt son, and spontaneously marries him. Mikey Madison’s beautifully open and spirited performance means we’re rooting for her every step of the way. Some have likened Anora to a Cinderella-like fairytale – minus the happy ever after. Pretty Woman it ain’t – but there’s far more going on here. As a snapshot of the degraded American Dream, a quarter of the way into the 21st century, for my money there’s been nothing better.

Bandleader RZA has alluded to later worldwide dates, saying in a statement:This is a special moment for me and all my Wu brothers to run around the globe together one more time and spread the Wu swag, music, and culture.

The Guardian,Nick Grimshaw’s 6 Music breakfast show review – eating a pork pie in bed is the morning joy we all need,"The toned-down radio DJ might be a safe bet to take over from Lauren Laverne – but wall-to-wall bangers and a UB40 song request from a listener enjoying a heroic breakfast make for a merry start to the dayBreakfast radio hosts are like spouses, colleagues, siblings and parents: they can be really, really annoying. It’s often a matter of timing – you might find a certain presenter grating at seven in the morning, but the same one prattling on after lunch totally inoffensive. Yet such a visceral, borderline irrational reaction does make the early morning slot a dicey endeavour. Nick Grimshaw will already be well aware of this occupational hazard as he takes over the 6 Music breakfast show from Lauren Laverne – he helmed Radio 1’s more high-profile equivalent between 2012 and 2018. As he kicks off his debut programme with the kind of hushed reverence that has long been de rigueur on the station, it’s obvious he is doing his best not to rile the faithful.I don’t find Grimshaw remotely irritating, though I can see why his (now toned-down) persona – slightly ditzy, chummily familiar – might not be for everyone. Personally, I’m very much looking forward to him bringing more of his giddily droll humour to the show. (We got a sprinkling of comedy this morning, largely courtesy of a an email requesting UB40 from a man eating a pork pie in bed). Yet, unlike his previous gig, the 6 Music breakfast show is clearly not meant to be a personality showcase. It’s not even supposed to be particularly entertaining; 6 Music is all about the songs (the clue’s in the name), something Grimshaw acknowledges early doors. He is “here with one job only: to start your day with the best music”. Continue reading...","Mon, 24 Feb 2025 12:47:33 GMT",0.5859,0.9927

Felicity Cloake tries out supermarket takes on chilled, ready-made chicken and vegetable soup• The best blenders to blitz like a pro, tried and testedAs a small child, my dream was to open an underwater restaurant (no, me neither), and the short menu I painstakingly wrote out for said venture started with chicken and vegetable soup. Which is to say, I have history with this dish. It feels familiar, comforting and overwhelmingly wholesome, yet I don’t often eat it these days, not least because I’ve never found one commercially that makes any welfare claims for the chicken concerned (and I’m generally too cheap to make it myself).So I was quite excited about this particular taste test – and perhaps inevitably disappointed that even the most expensive samples gave so little information about the provenance of their meat. That said, with a handful of exceptions, the standard was pretty high flavour-wise, and Aldi, Marks &amp; Spencer, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s all at least note that they use British chicken, which is a start.

The Guardian,Why we should stop wishing we were special – and celebrate being ordinary,"Trying to dazzle others with our brilliance all the time can lead us into dark places and take us further away from who we really areMany of us suffer from a wish to be special. We toil away in the unconscious belief that a special person is a better person, and a special life is a better life. Whether that specialness is conferred by the glamour of celebrity or social media likes, or by the dignified success of reaching the top of your profession, or by the glow of being anointed head girl (no, I wasn’t, and I’m not bitter about it, not at all), this craving to be raised above others, to be “the special one”, can lie at the heart of everything we do.This wish might be lurking under the making and breaking of your relationships, as you seek the person who will make you feel special, and reject the ones who don’t. It might hide in the extra hours you spend in the office to get something “just right” for your boss, rather than settling for good enough. It might ring out with the alarm that wakes you far too early to train for a marathon, or to perfect a yoga pose. Continue reading...","Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:00:53 GMT",0.7269,0.9926
The Guardian,The one change that worked: I found an escape from online life by swapping my home office for the library,"I can find essential and unusual facts for my arts journalism in the dusty old tomes – information not readily available on Google. And, as I did as a child, I lose myself in a world of books ...Last September, I started walking to the library every day. As a University College London alumnus, I get free membership of both the Senate House library and the university’s main library. It is 90 minutes door to door, at a thinking pace, the perfect stretch of time during which to fuss over whatever is bothering me (a sentence, a professional hurdle, a private conversation) then gradually forget all about it and just let my mind wander too. That’s what the walk does. It unknots me.That the destination is a library only compounds that. The beep when I swipe in with my card is the loudest thing I’ll hear all day. The necessary quiet of the space gentles my every gesture. I open doors more quietly. I pull chairs out from behind tables more carefully. I set up my station and sit down more promptly. And then I breathe.
 All around me are these old tomes with clothbound covers – exactly the kind of books I used to look for as a child in my library at primary school. At that age, already, I often felt the need to escape the busyness of the world outside and I’d latch on to the oldest hardbacks as the best place to go for a good story. 
 These days, it is online we are all trying – if momentarily – to escape. Well, this really is the place to do that. It is not that I need to consult an art history book for every piece of journalism I write, but doing so inevitably yields different details from only Googling an artist: a quote, say, from a 1970s catalogue no one has thought to digitise, or the title of a piece an artist mentioned seeing when they were a student in the 1980s.
 Also, just looking up from my laptop for the kind of regular break physios or optometrists sternly recommend now brings excitement, not dread. Instead of seeing the many chores (laundry, admin, clutter) that crowd my tiny workspace at home, my eyes land on a sea of titles. I’ve started photographing stacks of books. It is like concrete poetry.
 I got to Senate House early the other morning and picked an empty room at random, only to realise at 10am that I was in the German literature section, surrounded by titles that composed something unexpectedly lyrical when put together (Light Beneath the Horizon; So I Sat Then Between All the Seats; Twilight). In the art history section, I’ve felt a certain thrill at reconnecting with the kind of Big Book you have to consult repeatedly as a student (Erwin Panofsky’s Early Netherlandish Painting) but that you then somehow never lose, like furniture in your mind. This week I opened a book on Cy Twombly and glitter drifted out from the creases. You see what books do? Someone was inspired …
 If I’m cold or jittery, I’ll go downstairs and kind of melt into the noise of the coffee shop. If I’m stressed, I’ll walk to the Frank Auerbach section. And when I’m done, if there’s time, I walk home. No day at the office or WFH has ever felt as good. Continue reading...","Mon, 24 Feb 2025 10:00:01 GMT",0.1779,0.9722

The Guardian,"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for cabbage stuffed with rice, chestnuts and cheese | A kitchen in Rome","The late food historian Gillian Riley is the inspiration behind this thrifty yet moreish supperIt just so happened that I was back in London a few weeks ago, so I could attend a bash to commemorate and celebrate the life of food historian and typographer Gillian Riley. It was a beautiful, lively occasion organised by Gillian’s family and friends, and held at Room 71-73 in north London, just a few streets from the house she and her partner, James, lived and worked in so prolifically for many years. There was food, of course, and much of it – a half-wheel of parmesan and fanned plates of prosciutto and salami – from the local delicatessen, to which Gillian was a devoted customer. Wine flowed, too, thanks to The Little Wine Shop, also around the corner and another place to which Gillian and James were as devoted as the staff were to them: their last delivery arrived just a few weeks before Gillian died last year, aged 90.Gillian’s sister, Joanna, spoke about their early life growing up in North Yorkshire and how Gillian was always a “greedy” girl. Gillian’s niece, Esther, remembered the colour, texture, tastes and possibilities that Aunty Gill brought into her life. Others then participated in a lively pass-the-mic: colleagues from the worlds of typography and publishing, some of whom had once been her students, as well as friends and collaborators from the worlds of translation, academia, art and food writing. The stories and memories were eclectic, but they all had one thing in common: the invitations to lunch and dinner. Everyone there, it seemed, had enjoyed (often countless times) Gillian’s hospitable good cooking: meals she would shop for locally or in Chinatown, prepare with precision and glee, and share, while also discussing the next meal.

My friend’s father – most everyone’s father or mother or uncle, whoever – would, while on business trips overseas, visit the occasional video store or flea market and return with whatever films or books or albums they happened to find. It’s a haphazard, incomplete thing to consume the culture of a faraway place in this manner, like trying to divine the contours of a mouth from the texture of spittle.Red Dawn is a bad movie. Bad in a special, sincere kind of way. It’s about a bunch of teenagers who fight back against a Soviet invasion of the United States. Released in the early 80s, it belongs to a large fraternity of films in which scrappy underdog Americans fight back against the seemingly insurmountable but of course ultimately very surmountable power of the Soviet empire. In a couple of decades, the Russians would pass the baton of villainy to people who look like me, though in our case there was no real empire to speak of, and so we were mostly small-batch insidious, our specialty less tank-and-jet and more suicide-bomb-level violence. It didn’t much matter; Red Dawn with Arabs instead of Soviets for villains would have still been shit. Continue reading...","Mon, 24 Feb 2025 14:00:11 GMT",-0.7269,-0.9525

The Guardian,"Patricia Arquette on Trump, communes, art and ageing: ‘When I was growing up the whole world was pretty creepy’","She won hearts with True Romance – and an Oscar for Boyhood. The actor reflects on her TV show Severance, political chaos in the US and why human beings are a disasterIf escaping the world by running for the hills looks increasingly attractive to many of us – perhaps living on a commune – Patricia Arquette feels like that too. Head to the mountains, she says. “Plant seeds and farm.” But maybe not the commune part – she lived in one as a child and it wasn’t always utopian. If our conversation is more dystopian than usual, it’s probably because we’re talking about Severance, the hit Apple TV+ show now in its second season. In the first series, we were introduced to Lumon Industries, where some workers, tasked with doing something unknown but probably malevolent with data, were willingly “severed”; their work selves detached from their outside selves, with no memory between the two. If the drama started as an off-kilter take on work-life balance, it soon morphed into something much darker.
 Arquette plays Harmony Cobel, an icy and (mostly) controlled senior manager at Lumon before she was fired, then rehired. In the outside world, she is Mrs Selvig, neighbour of Mark, another Lumon employee (he is severed, she isn’t, and he doesn’t know she is his boss). Arquette wouldn’t say she likes Cobel as a character. “I feel sorry for her, in a way,” she says. “To be so indoctrinated by a thought system or organisation, whether it’s a religion, or a corporation or a military. Obviously, she’s done some things that are reprehensible, but like all people who do bad things, they always have reasons, excuses, for why they needed to do that thing.”A forthcoming episode, which Arquette can’t talk about, explains a lot about why Cobel is as she is. It’s intense – the flashes of almost violent emotion we’ve already seen come out in a deluge – and Arquette is typically brilliant. It reinforced her sympathy for the characters. “I kind of feel sorry for everyone. There’s a lot of self-deception, a lot of wanting to belong, of wilful ignorance – and then just a lot of trickery and deception. That is never good.” Continue reading...","Mon, 24 Feb 2025 05:00:03 GMT",0.5994,-0.6966
The Guardian,"‘I forgive the girl and boy for what they’ve done. If I didn’t, the hate would eat away at me’: Esther Ghey on life after the murder of her daughter Brianna","Transgender teenager Brianna Ghey was stabbed to death by two 15-year-olds. The killers had been radicalised on the dark web, while the victim was trapped in an online world of her own. Now her mother has become friends with the parent of one of the murderersThe first thing I notice about Esther Ghey is a blossom tree trailing down her left arm to her hand. There is one pink flower on the tattoo. Pink was her daughter Brianna’s favourite colour. If Brianna had got her way, the whole world would have been pink. And just after she was murdered by two teenage schoolchildren in February 2023, Ghey says, the world did briefly turn pink. The local blossom trees filled with the blossomiest blossom she had ever seen. “It really felt she was with us and that she was sending us a sign she was OK,” she says.Now Ghey has written a book, Under a Pink Sky. It’s a memoir of her and Brianna’s lives, and a manifesto of sorts; a shocking exploration of how deadly smartphones and online spaces can be. It’s also one of the most unflinching, inspirational autobiographies I’ve read, a remarkable cry of hope from the depths of despair.

The Guardian,The big picture: the jubilation of clubbing in 90s London,"Photographer Ewen Spencer captures the energy of a garage music night for working-class kidsEwen Spencer took this picture at a Sunday club night called Twice As Nice at The End in London’s West Central Street in 1999. He’d been a regular there back in the days when it was held at the Colosseum in Vauxhall, south of the river. The move to the West End signalled that its garage music was becoming more a mainstream part of culture. Spencer, who grew up in Newcastle upon Tyne, had been documenting underground party nights for a decade by then for magazines such as the Face and i-D. He was a soul boy at heart, and saw in garage culture similar attractions: “It was working-class kids dressing up for a big night out,” he recalls, “quite different from acid house, for example.”Spencer’s picture is included in a new Hayward Gallery touring exhibition After the End of History: British Working Class Photography 1989-2024. Spencer was influenced by north-east based photographers such as Chris Killip and Graham Smith; he wanted to make authentic pictures that captured “some of the moves and female-heavy love and jubilation of those nights”, he says.After the End of History: British Working Class Photography 1989-2024 is at Stills, Edinburgh, 21 March to 28 June Continue reading...","Sun, 23 Feb 2025 07:00:29 GMT",0.0,0.9571

After finding a photo of a woman smiling in a tree, he started to notice this was a recurrent theme, especially popular between the 1920s and 1950s. Over the years he accumulated 91 such photos, now collected into a book, Women in Trees. “A number of the photographers have created images that possess a remarkable depth and beauty,” he wrote in the book’s introduction. “The women exert a great effort to hold on to these trees without losing their balance. Their Sunday dresses and fashionable shoes stand in stark contrast to the nature around them.”Women in Trees by Jochen Raiß and Johanna Adorjan is out now (Hatje Cantz, £18) Continue reading...","Sat, 22 Feb 2025 17:00:12 GMT",0.0,0.9537
