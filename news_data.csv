The Guardian,Stacey Dooley: ‘I’ve spent my life assuring everyone I’m a strong woman’,"In more than 70 documentaries, Stacey Dooley’s disarmingly light touch has taken her to the heart of many of society’s darkest issues. After 20 years of filming she thought she’d seen it all… Until she became a mother. The broadcaster Stacey Dooley gave birth to her daughter, Minnie, in January 2023. Though she has reported on women for almost two decades, she has been surprised by the transformations of motherhood. “I went into it so unprepared,” she says. “I cannot begin to tell you.” Like other soon-to-be parents, Dooley decided against attending antenatal classes and rejected manuals offered by friends. “You know, I used to see mums finding it tough and I’d think, ‘It can’t be that hard.’ I really used to think that. Which is fucking hilarious. I owe all of those women an apology.”Dooley and I are in a hotel café in Knightsbridge, west London, where she is later due to meet her accountant. She has written a book, Dear Minnie, in which she profiles women who have had different experiences of conception, pregnancy and labour. Dooley’s own pregnancy was comparatively straightforward: some sickness, a scheduled C-section, though “the sleep deprivation knocked me for six,” she says. “I’ve never in my life been that tired.” In the book, Dooley describes the first six months of Minnie’s life as an overwhelm of struggle and vulnerability. “My living room looked like a teenager’s bedroom,” she writes. Her partner, the dancer Kevin Clifton, with whom Dooley was coupled during the 2018 series of Strictly Come Dancing, was given two weeks of paternity leave before being hauled back to work. (Clifton is currently appearing in a UK tour of Chicago.) “I remember him leaving and shutting the front door and being like, ‘What the hell am I going to do now?’” Dooley recalls. “And I felt envious. That he was going to be sleeping from 10pm to 8am. I remember feeling jealous of that.” Continue reading...","Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:00:05 GMT",0.7096,-0.8299

Starmer channelled the giants of British history (everyone we’re not embarrassed of; basically, Winston Churchill) on Sunday. He said we were at a “crossroads in history”.He used the phrase “we are gathered here today”, which I suppose was literally true, as they were, but also had a strange church-y overtone, as if he were trying to borrow the actual authority of God, and he explicitly yoked together the peace and security of Ukraine with that of everyone – all of Europe, but also “us” – Justin Trudeau was there, so presumably Canada’s, too.

The Guardian,Angie Stone was a wise singer who deeply understood the power of love and lust,"The neo-soul artist, who has died aged 63, had years of experience by the time she became a star – and brought it to bear on a carnal, careworn catalogue• News: soul singer Angie Stone dies in a car crash at 63Angie Stone was no overnight success. By the time 2001’s Mahogany Soul made her a star, she’d logged two decades in the game, starting out in pioneering all-girl rap trio the Sequence, before passing through went-nowhere R&amp;B groups like Devox and Vertical Hold and writing and singing with other artists (including D’Angelo, her former lover and father of their son, Michael). Once Clive Davis’s Arista Records signed her in 1999, those years of experience set her apart from the neo-soul pack, having worn a powerful grain into her rich, agile voice, and steeping her music in soul’s deep history.Her debut for Arista, Black Diamond, retooled lush 70s soul for the new century: Green Grass Vapors – a love song to the sweet leaf with Stone “higher than the Thunder Dome” – was from the same funky swamp as D’Angelo’s Chicken Grease, its smouldering guitar like a moaning panther. A remarkable reading of Marvin Gaye’s Trouble Man, meanwhile, mastered the track’s breathless, staccato chorus without breaking a sweat, channelling Gaye’s existential agonies with every holler to an oblivious lord.

Our expert peeled 5kg of potatoes to find out• The best blenders to blitz like a pro, tried and testedAir fryers inspire the sort of feelings that microwaves did in the 1980s. I vividly remember those new-fangled boxes being spoken about often, either dismissively or with delight. A rash of cookbooks followed, and dinner changed across the land. Fast-forward a few decades and air fryers have become the same kind of kitchen “disruptors”, offering time-saving convenience and healthier cooking, but with the added allure of easily achieved, mouth-watering crispiness.Since launching with a single-drawer design, air fryers have evolved. Sizes range from compact to XL, while drawer configurations can be double, split or stacked. Alongside air frying, many will grill, roast and bake, and some will dip to lower temperatures for dehydrating, fermenting and proving dough. One we tested features steam cooking, allowing you to whip up dim sum as easily as a roast dinner, while another included racks for cooking on four levels.Best air fryer overall:

The Amazon page for Alexander C Karp and Nicholas W Zamiska’s new book, The Technological Republic: Hard Power, Soft Belief and the Future of the West, also lists: a “workbook” containing “key takeaways” from the volume; a second volume on how the Karp/Zamiska tome “can help you navigate life”; and a third offering another “workbook” comprising a “Master Plan for Navigating Digital Age and the Future of Society”. It is conceivable that these parasitical works were written by humans, but I wouldn’t bet on it.Mr Karp, the lead author of the big book, is an interesting guy. He has a BA in philosophy from an American liberal arts college, a law degree from Stanford and a PhD in neoclassical social theory from Goethe University in Frankfurt. So he’s not your average geek. And yet he’s an object of obsessive interest to people both inside and outside the tech industry. Why?

The Guardian,"In Pontypool, I saw the looming threat of Nigel Farage – and how Labour is playing into his hands | John Harris","Instead of bowing to rightwing populism, Starmer should take it on by rebuilding towns – and giving people the jobs and homes they craveThe south Welsh town of Pontypool doesn’t quite suggest a crucial political frontline. The town centre is full of imposing 19th- and 20th-century buildings that were created in a spirit of pride and optimism but have long since lain empty; local people talk about the shadow of the old iron and coal industries, and the fact that precious little ever came along to take their place. On the Monday afternoon I visited, the most forlorn sight was a huge mural of a local rugby crowd, lovingly sprayed on the exterior of a former discount store: a two-dimensional throng, put there to “inspire people to remember what Pontypool could be like as a thriving community”.Despite appearances, a significant watershed moment happened here recently. Like so much of south Wales, Pontypool has long been seen as a loyal Labour redoubt – but on 13 February, Reform UK gained its first Welsh councillor in a byelection for the local borough council. The victor was a former army major who won 457 votes to Labour’s anaemic 259, and claimed, when greeting his win, that there would now be no Labour councillors, MPs or members of the Senedd, the Welsh parliament, who could confidently think they represented safe seats. Reform UK is set on banishing the lingering idea of south Wales as a staunch socialist heartland: Nigel Farage intends to make the 2026 devolved Welsh elections “by far our biggest priority”.John Harris is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Sun, 02 Mar 2025 16:28:09 GMT",-0.4767,0.9949
The Guardian,Trump said Zelenskyy ‘does not have the cards’. But how well is he playing his own hand? | Olga Chyzh,"The US president has no interest in countering aggressors. His short-termist game plan will cost America dearThe White House meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be remembered as far more than just a diplomatic disaster. It marked the end of international politics as we know it, and was a harbinger for the sunset of Pax Americana. Zelenskyy, reeling from the meeting, arrived in London on Saturday to attend a defence summit with other European leaders. Thanks to Trump’s performance, those leaders now have clarity on where the US government stands on the war in Ukraine – and, more broadly, on how US foreign policy may look in future.It is hard to overstate what a departure this is. Since the end of the second world war, the US has been the primary architect and guarantor of an intricate network of global institutions anchored by Nato, the World Trade Organization, and the International Monetary Fund. Together, these partners crafted a security umbrella whose benefits far outweighed its expense. It produced political stability and provided US and European companies with unrivalled access to markets and resources. The US was all too happy to share the gains of this order with its allies, and, to a lesser extent, with its rivals and adversaries.Olga Chyzh researches political violence and repressive regimes.

The Guardian,Trump has turbocharged the news cycle and I’m struggling to keep up | Stewart Lee,"Maintaining pace with the US president’s wild outbursts and the mind-boggling media reports about him is no laughing matterThe smelly thoughts of Donald Trump bubble up like brown burps in the sort of bombsite pond Chopper bike-riding children were advised to avoid in 1970s public information films. Do they indicate concrete plans, are they designed to provoke, or do they have no meaning, like the gurgles and gasps that can inadvertently escape from a decomposing corpse? My job here is to try to anticipate if anything Trump says or does is likely to be of any lasting significance and to satirise it accordingly, in the small window of time allowed, for money. And it isn’t getting any easier. Yes, Ukraine is suffering, but I am the real victim here.For example, last Saturday Trump opined: “We were the richest… think of this, from 1870 to 1913… because we collected tariffs… We had so much wealth. Wouldn’t it be nice today? Of course, now, we give it away to transgender this, to transgender that. Everybody gets a transgender operation. It’s wonderful. We give it away to crazy things. But in those days, it was different. It was a different world. It was a different country.”Stewart Lee tours Stewart Lee vs the Man-Wulf this year, with a Royal Festival Hall run in July Continue reading...","Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:00:05 GMT",-0.4215,0.8992

The Guardian,It’s two years since the kids left. Here’s what I’ve learned – and what has surprised me | Emma Beddington,"There’s more leisure, less laundry and no more Nando’s on the sofa. But I’m still struggling to get to grips with this tidy, idle new lifeI come into the kitchen to find my husband staring into space, which is normally my job. Then he points. “It’s time to accept we aren’t bread-bin people,” he says.I believe, instinctively, ancestrally, in bread bins; I come from bread-bin stock. But since we acquired ours five years ago, it has been used probably five times. On one of these occasions, a loaf was left in there for so long that the buildup of mould caused the lid to warp. I assumed the problem was living with teenagers with no object permanence, who, even if they saw the bread go in, forgot it existed once it was no longer visible. However, after two years of an empty nest, bread still lives on top of the bin. It turns out that even I am not a bread-bin person.I am actually very tidy – indeed, unpleasantly uptight about tidiness. It was the eternal churn of family mess that made me a slattern.We are now a Nando’s-free household after years of peri-peri tyranny, but I find myself pining for “macho peas” and pallid, lukewarm chips. Is it the flabby fries or the slack, companionable comfort of those four-on-the-sofa TV dinners I want? My husband suggested getting a small, elegant sofa recently, but the idea of never squashing the four of us on to ours again made me unspeakably sad.I don’t want a dog. It has been 18 months since my beloved dog Oscar died. Empty nesters always get dogs, but I don’t want to nurture anything more demanding than our roster of surrogate children (idiot hens, an infant tortoise and Susan, the fugitive wedding dove on our roof who arrived eight months ago, but still won’t let me touch her).If we don’t do a weekly food shop, nothing falls apart and no one perishes.Escaping the parenting trenches before most of my peers means I socialise a lot with older people – and, oof, their energy! Does your life force gradually replenish until you can bounce through pilates, Zumba and five-a-side, volunteer for multiple charities, learn the harpsichord and improve your Arabic? When does that start, please?Life feels blissfully easy day to day (less laundry, more leisure) and existentially confusing. I feel as tied to my sons as ever, but also cut off, teetering between overbearing interference and strenuously pretending to be casual, constantly second-guessing whether I should ask how the exam went, if they slept, whether the sun is shining where they are. Reading Nina Stibbe’s latest diaries I was envious at how happily enmeshed she is in her grownup children’s lives.It’s cringey how much I miss them. Sometimes, I catch myself staring jealously over my husband’s shoulder at a WhatsApp from one of them; I regularly check the weather where they live; when they Deliveroo on my account, I spy on their orders.It’s also annoying when they come home, wilfully misunderstanding the recycling system, eating at inconvenient times and using towels like oligarchs. Just as I adjust and relax, they leave again.I thought I would work harder when they left, become a single-minded art monster. Instead, I feel fallow, like my brain used itself up producing this crop of offspring and needs a year (or five) off. It’s unnerving. I read a lot about the creative power of idleness to try to reassure myself.It’s no surprise to remember how much I like my husband’s company, but it’s astonishing to realise we only cohabited for five years before careering into 22 years of full-on family life. We are as free now as when he arrived in London in 1997 (on crutches, with his grandmother’s yucca tree). Dizzyingly so: we could do anything we like. Raise ostriches! Join a cult! Move to Acapulco! But I don’t want to rip everything up. I hope that is a good sign. Life feels quiet, spacious and strange; a long, slow exhale. What will the inhale bring? No idea.

The Guardian,"In this dangerous age, Britain needs to exert soft power as well as the hard stuff | Andrew Rawnsley","Defence spending has to go up, but siphoning money from international aid is a self-defeating follyShortly before he flew to Washington, Sir Keir Starmer turned up in the Commons, put on his sombre voice and declared: “Everything has changed.” One of the more startling transformations has been to Sir Keir himself. The Labour leader came to office thinking, as did most of those who voted for him, that he was going to be a domestically orientated prime minister with primary ambitions to improve living standards, build lots of homes and rejuvenate public services. That’s what “change”, his one-word election slogan, was supposed to be about. When he originally selected his overriding “five missions”, the defence of the realm didn’t make the cut.His central definition today is as a geopolitically focused prime minister who is promising to spend more on guns, missiles and warplanes and less on international aid. More British bullets will be purchased at the expense of succour to the impoverished and desperate of the world. This shift gives a flintier profile to his leadership, but not in a way that either supporters or opponents anticipated during last summer’s election. Most Labour people don’t quarrel with the argument that Britain has to put up its guard, but a lot of them, including queasy members of the Starmer cabinet, are wriggling uncomfortably about taking the hatchet to the international development budget. In the days since the decision was announced, they have taken to wondering what manner of Labour government is this? Continue reading...","Sun, 02 Mar 2025 07:30:01 GMT",-0.34,0.8121

The Guardian,The Guardian view on a tax war: the world must unite against American obstruction | Editorial,"Donald Trump’s threats to global tax reform have backfired, leaving the US isolated as nations push ahead with a new UN tax conventionDonald Trump’s Oval Office tirade on Friday laid bare his instinct to harangue and bully those – even supposed allies such as Ukraine, fighting for its survival&nbsp;– who dare to disagree. Countries pushing global tax reform at the UN will be watching as US demands for subjugation play out in plain sight. His day-one threat to punish nations taxing US firms is an all-out attack on global fiscal cooperation. If multilateralism in taxation was already on shaky ground, Mr Trump’s return could bury it for good.Under discussion is a new UN tax convention that may permit states to tax economic activity where it actually occurs, rather than allowing multinationals to shift profits to tax havens. The Tax Justice Network (TJN) said last year that nations lose $492bn (£390bn) annually due to corporate tax abuse. The global south bears the greatest losses, which undermine public services like health and education. If enacted, the convention would create a legally binding framework requiring multinationals to pay tax where they employ staff and do real business – not where they stash profits. This would replace the outdated arm’s-length principle with unitary taxation, ensuring fair profit allocation. It would mean an end to Amazon, Google and Apple putting billions through lower-tax jurisdictions while extracting wealth from higher-tax ones.

The Guardian,Mythili Prakash: She’s Auspicious review – a paean to girl power,"Sadler’s Wells East, LondonIndian-American dancer Prakash dismantles the myth of a female goddess granted power by menAs a child, Mythili Prakash was always puzzled by the myth around the goddess Durga, who was created by a panel of male gods to slay the demon Mahisha. Why should a woman be given her power by a man, she wondered. And it’s something she’s still wondering about.
 She’s Auspicious is a dismantling of the idea of woman being put on a pedestal, bestowed with value through someone else’s eyes. Being shaped by an outside view of womanhood – even a supposedly flattering one – is a suffocation of sorts. Prakash is an Indian-American dancer, best known in the UK for performing with Akram Khan, who has mentored her. Her brand of bharatanatyam (the traditional dance form comes from southern India) blends classical technique with a questioning sensibility and the freeform structure of contemporary theatre.Prakash is an accomplished dancer who, at first at least, doesn’t give too much away. A contained presence, her movement is economical, undemonstrative, and not clouded by the strain of visible effort (there’s great skill in that, and power over her instrument). She can balance in absolute stillness, rooted to the earth.
 As the piece progresses she gradually scrolls through emotional states: anxiety, relief, delight, enforced restraint, with her usually freely expressive hands suddenly clamped stiff over her mouth. She begins as a woman, plainly dressed in black and white, but is elevated to goddess status, reappearing in vivid red, in a kind of shrine made of scaffolding, with a coterie of followers. Seven women in shades of indigo bow and pray and sing and make music for her. She is deified and decorated with jewellery. But for Prakash, that’s not the aspiration. You get the sense that this goddess is also a woman, a mother, a person of flaws and conflict (and strength and compassion). When Prakash throws off all expectations, her hair swings loose, her movements become bigger and freer, feet planted wide, mouth agape with something akin to both hunger and glee.
 She’s Auspicious turns into a paean to girl power, an uprising. Percussionist Aswini Srinivasan especially drives the energy forward with racing rhythms, the women banging sticks against the scaffold, the shrine tumbling. It’s a piece about agency; an undoing of the myth.

The Guardian,David Johansen obituary,"Singer, songwriter, actor and punk pioneer best known as the frontman of New York DollsOn the day that the New York Dolls appeared on the BBC music show The Old Grey Whistle Test in 1973, they were openly derided by the host, Bob Harris. “Mock rock,” he opined to camera.For all his snarling attitude, the band’s singer, David Johansen, who has died aged 75, might well have agreed. The last thing he expected was for his band to be taken seriously. The Dolls took their lead not from the “adult-oriented” rock and earnest singer-songwriters dominating the US album charts, but from the glam rock scene making headway in the UK singles charts. British acts from the Sex Pistols to Morrissey would later repay the compliment, citing the band as a key influence. Continue reading...","Sun, 02 Mar 2025 16:46:23 GMT",0.0,0.7543
The Guardian,The Americas review – Tom Hanks’ beautiful new nature series pretends the climate crisis doesn’t exist,"This look at the wildlife of the American continent is vast, grandiose and awe-inspiring. But its approach to nature is so cosy it’s the eco equivalent of wearing blinkers and sticking your fingers in your earsIt does seem a little spoiled to be critical of a documentary as gorgeous as The Americas, a vast, grandiose Tom Hanks-narrated nature series which explores territory from New England to the tip of Patagonia. But we are living through an extraordinary glut of nature television, and the pool of previously unfilmed and unfilmable natural world scenes must surely be getting smaller. This 10-parter talks up its credentials as something new and different: five years in the making, gathered over 180 separate expeditions, capturing discoveries which have never been on camera before, the most expensive unscripted project ever made by NBC (via BBC Studios). Why, then, does it feel so familiar, and occasionally even tepid?This is nature television that is best enjoyed with your brain closed off. Much like Apple TV+’s recent The Secret Lives of Animals, it favours cutesy anthropomorphism and spectacular visuals over any honest assessment of nature and the environment as a whole. There is little brutality, barely any peril – a red-tailed hawk hovers near some adorable racoon babies, but that’s about it – and an almost offensive unwillingness to even consider the impact humanity has had, and continues to have, on species and their habitats.The Americas aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.

The Guardian,‘He contains the whole of literature’: is Dickens better than Shakespeare?,"After rereading the entire works of the great Victorian novelist during the pandemic, Peter Conrad became convinced – whisper it – that Dickens is an even greater writer than that other British literary giant, the BardWho is better, Dickens or Shakespeare? We asked nine prominent writersEarly in 2020, as society shut down, I retreated behind closed doors with Charles Dickens, who kept me company and cheered me up throughout the pandemic. Carried along by narratives that Dickens thought of as speedy locomotives and warmed by a combustible imagination that he compared to an industrial forge, I soon felt no need for tame timed circuits of the local park, and I even stopped fretting about the imminent end of the world. But although Dickens saved from me one disease, he infected me with another: escaping Covid-19, I contracted an incurable monomania instead.Emerging after the last lockdown, I buttonholed any friend who would listen and began to claim that Dickens contained the whole of literature. His novels made everyone else’s seem puny. Larger even than the newly metropolitan London he described, their scale is planetary: looking down from on high in A Tale of Two Cities, he ponders “the feeble shining of this earth of ours” and marvels at the “greatnesses and littlenesses” crammed on to it. Those swarming creatures are not exclusively human. At a country estate in Bleak House, Dickens overhears “motions of fancy” in the barnyard, where stabled horses conspire to corrupt a pony, a dim-witted mastiff dozing in the sun is puzzled by the moving shadows, and a turkey frets about the coming of Christmas. Inanimate objects also qualify as characters, and Sketches by Boz floats a theory about the physiognomy of brass door-knockers, which mould themselves into portraits of the house-owners.

The Guardian,Listen In: How Radio Changed the Home review – the wonder of the wireless revolution,"Beaty Rubens’s study of the impact of early radio broadcasts in Britain is full of fascinating and often poignant detailOne hundred years ago this summer, from high above Daventry in Northamptonshire, voices began to beam into the homes of 20 million people. They came from the 500ft tall Borough Hill transmitter – truly revolutionary technology in 1925 – which opened with a new work, Daventry Calling, by the poet Alfred Noyes.“Sitting around your hearth/Ye are at one with all on earth,” the poem concluded, giving a utopian flavour that recurs often through Beaty Rubens’s meticulously detailed, engaging book. Exploring how radio transformed the lives of Britons between the two world wars, it’s a striking read in our smartphone-dominated world, as we witness another radical invention quickly becoming part of everyday life. A portal into other places from your own house was also an easy concept to sell. Take the cover of the first Christmas issue of Radio Times from 1923, one of many fascinating images in the book, showing a rapt family gathering around their small set.

The lure of one-click, next-day consumables unleashed my inner impulse buyer like a starving castaway at a buffet. I never quite became a shopping addict, but the thrill of home delivery fuelled a period of slightly unhinged affluenza. My house filled with stuff while my bank account drained. I accumulated retro camera kit (70% unused to this day), expensive books about using said camera kit (100% unread) and an untold number of dresses that I bought only because I could send them back for free.

Just in case? Should we all perhaps, have a little stash of mifepristone in our makeup bags, a secret number in our phone? Something is happening in the US that requires our attention. Hard-earned rights are being erased and the speed at which history is being rewritten there does not bode well for our freedoms here. We are already seeing dark reflections in the glass. This month the Observer reported how British anti-abortion campaigners are echoing US vice-president JD Vance. He claimed our new buffer zone laws, preventing protests outside abortion clinics, were an attack on the “liberties of religious Britons”, shifting focus away from the reason they were implemented to a debate about freedom of speech.Buffer zones (intended to protect staff and women using the clinics) are being targeted in a careful campaign by conservative Christian groups such as the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a group that wants to ban abortion, opposes same-sex marriage and, in the US, has helped at least 23 states pass legislation barring trans athletes from girls’ and women’s events as well as drafting legislation restricting gender-affirming treatment for minors. With only 1.4% of adolescents in the US identifying as transgender, LGBTQ+ rights groups accused the ADF of “whipping up a panic” over decisions better left to doctors, teachers and parents.

The Guardian,‘We’re losing decades of our life to this illness’: long Covid patients on the fear of being forgotten,"Five years on from March 2020, millions of people still face debilitating symptoms, with huge repercussions on public health and productivity. But politicians are starting to pretend the pandemic never happenedOn 20 March 2020, Rowan Brown started to feel a tickle at the back of her throat. Over the next few days, new symptoms began to emerge: difficulty breathing, some tiredness. By the following week, the UK had been put under lockdown in a last-minute attempt to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, or Covid-19. No one else she knew had yet been infected, so she posted updates on Facebook to keep people informed: “Oh, guys, it feels like a mild flu. Tonsillitis was definitely worse.”Brown didn’t know then she was at the beginning of a condition that did not yet have a name, but which has since become known as long Covid. After two weeks, she had a Zoom with a friend, and at the end of the conversation it was as if all life force had drained out of her body. Her doctor advised her to stay in bed for two weeks. Those two weeks turned into three and a half months of extended Covid symptoms: nausea, fevers, night sweats, intense muscle and joint pain, allodynia (a heightened sensitivity to pain), hallucinations, visual disturbances. By the end of the three months, she had noted 32 different symptoms. “I didn’t recognise the way my body felt at all: my skin, my hair,” she remembers now. “It was like being taken over by a weird alien virus, which I guess is what happened.” Continue reading...","Sun, 02 Mar 2025 08:00:03 GMT",-0.7717,-0.9437

The Guardian,‘We cleared rubble with our bare hands’: Iraqis rejoice as shattered Mosul rises from the ruins,"City damaged during occupation by Islamic State group reopens 850-year-old mosque in time for Ramadan as reconstruction gathers pace  In the small courtyard of Sara’s grandmother’s house, children are running and playing as if time had never passed. “The house kept our memories,” Sara says, sitting on the sofa of the courtyard. “It seems like we never left. On the contrary, when we came back, we felt we belonged to this house.”Located in the old Iraqi city of Mosul, right behind the Great Mosque of al-Nuri, their home is part of the local cultural heritage. It was heavily damaged during the occupation by Islamic State (IS) and the battle to reclaim the city by Iraqi armed forces, backed by US coalition airstrikes. Sara and her family were forcibly displaced during the fighting in 2017 and for many years feared they would never see their home intact again.

Like the candidate whose CV falsely boasted of a second-dan black belt in taekwondo, only to discover his interviewer was an aficionado of the sport. “An interview that should have been an hour lasted 15 minutes,” said Collingwood, the managing director of the IT recruitment agency Viqu.Or the candidate who claimed he had attended a certain private school, which his interviewer had also attended and would have been in the year above.

The Guardian,The truth about young men and sex: ‘We go along with things we’re uncomfortable with’,"Do they really think about it every seven seconds? Are they only after one-night stands? We asked 30 men to bare all – their answers may surprise youThere’s a stereotype about young men and sex. I see it play out across social media, and over wine-fuelled chats with my friends: that men only want one thing, that they all cheat and that, ultimately, they’re selfish in bed. It’s an idea that has been fuelled by the rise of toxic masculinity influencers such as Andrew Tate, who discuss sex as something they are “owed” and encourage other men to think similarly.For the past eight years, I’ve worked at Cosmopolitan magazine, speaking to millennial and gen-Z women about their love lives, and I can’t deny that there is some truth to the stereotype. But when I&nbsp;decided to have candid (and at times incredibly awkward) conversations with men in their 20s about&nbsp;their sex lives, another story emerged: one of insecurity, hidden and misunderstood sexualities, and often a deeper need for connection.
