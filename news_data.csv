The Guardian,This is how the grooming scandal is being weaponised – and this is what Starmer must do | Gaby Hinsliff,"There is a nagging sense that justice still has not been done. At a Reform rally, I watched Nigel Farage exploit that “Sophie” was 12 years old when she walked into Oldham police station to report a sexual assault. For a vulnerable child, first befriended and then viciously exploited by much older men, that must have taken courage. But officers simply told her to come back when she wasn’t drunk. It was a terrible missed opportunity, as an independent review of so-called grooming gang allegations in Oldham commissioned by the Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham made clear in 2022. Sophie was picked up from the police station and driven to a house where she was raped by multiple men. Many years later, she learned that although a man eventually convicted of abusing her had given Greater Manchester police two other names, they had inexplicably failed to follow these leads.There are thousands of Sophies out there, yet they are already slipping through the cracks of a debate that is supposedly about them: becoming pawns in an unedifying power struggle on the right of British politics, as the world’s richest man tests the limits of his influence over it.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Save UK investment trusts from New York’s blackjack raider. Vote no to Saba | Nils Pratley,"The City should protest about US hedge fund manager Boaz Weinstein’s attempt to seize control of seven trustsSaba Capital’s proposals are “self-serving and destructive”, says the chair of one of seven London-listed investment trusts in the firing line of the New York hedge fund. Another is “appalled by Saba’s action and conduct”. A third says Saba is pursuing “a backdoor attempt to seize control of the trust”. A fourth thinks Saba is following an “unknown and unproven” strategy and, similarly, is trying to “take control of your company for its own economic benefit”.When opinion is so uniform, it is tempting to take the opposite side and suspect a case of vested City interests feeling threatened. After all, the popular criticism of investment trusts – companies that invest in other companies – is that there are too many of them and that their boards are complacent even when share prices trade at frustratingly wide discounts to the value of the underlying assets.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Elon Musk’s disinformation: escalating hate and threatening democracy | Editorial,"The UK prime minister calls out the reckless amplification of conspiracy theories by the world’s richest man on child sexual abuse. GoodOn Monday, Sir Keir Starmer rightly defended robust debate but insisted it “must be grounded in facts, not lies”, in response to Elon Musk’s falsehoods about his role in dealing with child sexual exploitation. The prime minister has wisely not engaged Mr Musk directly, partly because the world’s richest man is a member of Donald Trump’s inner circle. Sir Keir recognises this epistemic crisis as a coordinated campaign to spread disinformation, sow division, and erode trust. As the philosopher Lee McIntyre aptly notes: “The truth isn’t dying – it’s being killed.”The goal is clear: to create groups in society that unquestioningly accept an authoritarian leader’s word. In this way, opinions are no longer based on facts but rooted in identity. Disinformation becomes a potent political weapon, making voters believe falsehoods while distrusting – even hating – those who don’t.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Starmer and the NHS: renewal is the right priority | Editorial,"Using the private sector to drive down waiting lists must not lead to the erosion of public healthcareBy kicking off the first full week of 2025 with a speech&nbsp;in which he called the NHS the “cornerstone”&nbsp;of&nbsp;his government’s plan to rebuild Britain, Sir Keir Starmer was in one sense stating the obvious. The health service is recognised as one of his party’s all-time greatest achievements by social democrats the world over.Everyone knows that improving it is vital if polling numbers are to tilt the government’s way. By offering warm thanks to health service staff who worked over Christmas, while emphasising customer service values of convenience and flexibility, Sir Keir sought to square the circle of reform that champions the interests of both the workforce and the public.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Political turn-offs that result in low voter turnouts | Letters,"Readers react to warnings that renters, students and other groups appear to be shunning the ballot boxIt is hardly surprising that there has been a huge reduction in voting by people in rented accommodation, excluded and vulnerable groups, and students (Turnout inequality in UK elections close to tipping point, report warns, 1 January). The Tories introduced voter ID in the face of evidence that voter fraud in the UK is rare. This was a blatant attempt to undermine the basic human right in a democracy: that everyone has the opportunity to vote even if it is just once in every five years.Our politics always fails to deliver for the people who have the least stake in our society and our electoral system continues to deliver disproportionate outcomes, never more so than in 2024. The Tories and Labour are financed by big money and corporate interests that have no interest in the voices of marginalised people.

The Guardian,Look to the past to revive the north-east | Letter,"Judith Martin suggests young people could spend time doing something constructive in deprived areas of the UKAdmirers of Ken Loach will have seen Horden in his film The Old Oak, along with other parts of the north-east that were devastated economically by the loss of industry (‘Take this house or you’re homeless’: families sent to a Durham town from London, 31 December). In the film, a pub landlord enables the integration of a refugee family; in reality, it’s more likely to be charities or councils, which are already on their uppers.Why, when a house can cost as little as £16,000, is anyone living in temporary accommodation? Thatcherite dogma decreed that only the private sector could fix any problem, and John Prescott’s Pathfinder programme led to the demolition of thousands of “market failure” houses in areas like these. But why cannot councils acquire these redundant houses? Why is it left to private investors to make money out of these situations? Continue reading...","Mon, 06 Jan 2025 16:40:19 GMT",0.34,-0.5775

Enzo Maresca wants to strengthen his back four after losing Wesley Fofana and Benoît Badiashile to hamstring injuries and Guéhi, who came through the academy at Stamford Bridge before leaving for Palace in 2021, is emerging as a serious target this month.The England defender was close to joining Newcastle last summer, only for talks to break down over the north-east club’s reluctance to pay a fee of around £70m. It is unclear if Chelsea, who are also considering recalling Trevoh Chalobah from his loan at Palace, would be willing to go that high but they believe that a big bid would test the Selhurst Park club’s resolve. The 24-year-old has 18 months left on his deal but Palace are in a relegation battle and losing him would be a major blow for their manager, Oliver Glasner.

The Guardian,What we’re reading: writers and readers on the books they enjoyed in December,"Authors, journalists and Guardian readers discuss the titles they have read over the last monthI enjoyed Pretentiousness: Why It Matters by Dan Fox. I am a guilty user of the word pretentious, which the book methodically rebukes over its hundred-and-something pages. Art moves forward because people aspire to things they are not (I certainly feel this as a writer). It’s also a word with deeply classist roots, made even worse by the fact that its meaning is often unclear. Instead of saying pretentious, I now think of other words that more accurately describe why I dislike something, such as vapid, poorly written or ugly.

The Guardian,"‘It’s easy to call what she did evil’: inside Denmark’s Oscars entry, about a serial child murderer","Dagmar Overbye took in unwanted children – and killed them in horrific ways. The directer of The Girl With the Needle explains why he brought the story of ‘The Angel Maker’ to the big screenThe citizens of Denmark enjoy a reputation for living an exceptionally stress-free existence. This is in large part due to the small Scandinavian state’s unusually simple system for accessing government services. Every Dane or Danish resident has a CPR (Central Person Register) number made up of their date of birth and four extra digits that is used for anything from banking to tax returns, healthcare and borrowing library books.It’s a boon of convenience with a grim backstory: Danish welfare services are so streamlined because since 1924 councils have been forced by law to keep population registers, a measure that was catalysed by one of the most gruesome serial murders in the country’s history. Three years earlier, 33-year-old Dagmar Overbye was found to have killed nine infants in her care (and was suspected of murdering 17 more), most of them foster children whose disappearance had not shown up in the national records.

The Guardian,The big idea: can what you eat change your mind?,"From designer drinks to dodgy leftovers, our brain responds to food in surprising waysProbiotic drinks, brain-boosting superfoods, gut-healthy snack bars: every day we’re bombarded with information about what and what not to eat. Some foods move abruptly between these categories depending on who you ask: if a gut-healthy snack bar is ultra-processed, does that cancel out its benefits? You’d be forgiven for thinking that every food choice you make has immediate, direct consequences for your health. And, increasingly, your brain. Does broccoli make you brighter? Can a pickle really act as a pick-me-up?There is some scientific truth to this magic. By now you may have heard that people with poorer mental health, such as those experiencing depression or anxiety, have a different balance of bacteria in their gut – a reduction in the richness and diversity of their microbiomes. This fits neatly with elegant (albeit slightly gross) experiments in the lab in which transplanting faeces from people with depression into rats induces “depression-like” behaviours. How is this possible? It’s because your gut sends signals to your brain via the vagus nerve, your immune system, and other means, passing on information about how things are going down there. And so, the theory goes, a less-diverse microbiome might be the cause of a depressed or anxious brain. Maybe a gut-healthy snack bar really would help?

The Guardian,Wayne Osmond obituary,"Member of the Osmonds who was a vital part of the family group as a singer, composer and multi-instrumentalistAccording to the biographical film Inside the Osmonds (2001), the Osmond family mottoes were: “It doesn’t matter who’s out front, as long as it’s an Osmond” and “Family, faith, and career. In that order.”Wayne Osmond, who has died aged 73, was never a solo star like his siblings Donny, Marie and Jimmy, but he was a vital part of the family band as a singer, composer and multi-instrumentalist. He shared fully in the Osmonds’ devout Mormon faith, which seemed to enable the group to resist the more outlandish temptations of the show-business lifestyle.

The Guardian,Rachel Roddy’s recipe for lentil and spinach soup | A kitchen in Rome,"A beautifully simple vegetable soup/stew with a link to Italian folkloreOnce upon a time in Messina, there lived a boy named Nick who loved to swim. Or so begins the tale of Cola Pesce, told by many, including Italo Calvino in his book of Italian folktales. So great was his love that Nick spent his days and nights in the sea while his mother stood on the shore, pleading: “Oh, Nick, come out of the water, you are not a fish.” He didn’t listen, though, and every day he swam farther out while his desperate mum yelled across the water until it gave her a kink in her intestines. Then, one day, having screamed herself hoarse, she blurted out – as is so often the case in such circumstances – “Nick, may you turn into a fish.” And he did – or, rather, he turned into a half-fish, half-man, with webbed feet like a duck and a throat like a frog. And that was that; Nick never set foot on land again, which upset his mum so much that she died.As is also the case in such circumstances, news of Nick the fish reached the king, who sent a sailor to find him. “Oi,” shouted the sailor when he spotted Nick gliding on a wave, “the king of Messina wants to see you.” Nick, not having any choice in the matter, swam over to the palace. The king was delighted and ordered Nick to swim around the entire coast of Sicily to see where the sea was deepest and what was there. Nick followed orders, and he soon recounted that he’d seen mountains, caves, valleys and fish on the floor of the sea; he had been frightened only once, when he passed the lighthouse and was unable to find the bottom. Nick also discovered that Messina rested on three columns: one whole, one splintered, one broken. Continue reading...","Mon, 06 Jan 2025 11:00:47 GMT",0.0,0.9568

Fresh tomatoes and cavolo nero add plant points and interest, while pickled pink onions bring crunch and sharpness. If you want a quick, 30-minute curry, make this with jarred chickpeas; if you’re using tinned, cook them for longer and with more boiling water, because they need more time to soak up the flavours.

One notable example came during the Industrial Revolution, when the peppered moth turned from black and white to entirely black after soot darkened its habitat. The black moths were camouflaged against the soot-covered trees, surviving to pass on their genes to the next generation.As human influence has expanded, so too have the strange adaptations forced on the natural world.

She talks about her new tour, her best friend Carlos Gu and her ‘completely new upper body’Amy Dowden’s motto is simple: “Don’t get bitter, get better.” There is so much she could be bitter about. As the dancer put it herself in the BBC documentary Strictly Amy: Cancer and Me, in the past year she has had to contend with a mastectomy, chemotherapy, sepsis, blood clots and a broken foot, to say nothing of menopause, breast reconstruction surgery and the Crohn’s disease she has lived with since the age of 19. But this was the vow Dowden made last August on the eve of her against-the-odds return to Strictly Come Dancing. She had missed the 2023 season completely thanks to the cancer that came to light when she discovered a lump in her breast the day before her honeymoon. 2023 was a hellscape. 2024 was supposed to be her year. Until it wasn’t.In October, in week six of Strictly, dressed as a freckly scarecrow for the Halloween special, Dowden collapsed backstage after her foxtrot to Dancing in the Moonlight. Her breast cancer – actually two types of cancer, ductal and lobular – is in remission, subject to annual checks, and her Crohn’s is under control. But stress fractures to the shin are a common peril for all dancers. Having spent most of the previous year in and out of hospital, she then had to watch the show from the sidelines again, as her celebrity partner – the JLS singer JB Gill – made it all the way to the final with Dowden’s friend, the professional dancer Lauren Oakley.
