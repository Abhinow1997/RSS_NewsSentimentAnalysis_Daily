Europe is looking for leaders who can engage Trump on the future of the continent as the US leader appears more inclined to demand tribute from his allies and cosy up to Vladimir Putin. Sir Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador the US, has called this one of the “most consequential meetings of a British prime minister and president that we have had since the second world war”.Can the “special relationship” between the US and the UK save the day? Or has the era of transatlantic cooperation ended in the era of “America first”?

The Guardian,"Ukraine war briefing: Trump panders to Russia by shutting Kyiv out of Nato, says Kaja Kallas","EU foreign secretary says US wouldn’t have sat down with Bin Laden to ask what he wanted after 9/11; strikes on Kharkiv energy targets. What we know on day 1,101Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign minister, has accused Donald Trump of falling for a Russian narrative by closing the door on Nato membership for Ukraine. “Why are we in Nato? It is because we are afraid of Russia. And the only thing that really works – the only security guarantee that works – is Nato’s umbrella,” she said. Trump said last week of the war that Ukraine potentially joining Nato was “probably the reason the whole thing started”. In an interview published on Thursday by Agence France-Presse, Kallas said: “These accusations are totally untrue. That is the Russian narrative that we should not buy.”Kallas – a former prime minister of Estonia, which borders Russia – said Nato countries had never attacked Russia which instead was “afraid of democracy”. Interviewed in Washington, the EU high representative for foreign affairs, said of Trump’s approach: “My question is, why we should give Russia what they want on top of what they have already done – attacking Ukraine, annexing territory, occupying territory, and now offering something on top of it? … Consider here in America that after 9/11 you would have sat down with Osama bin Laden and said ‘OK, what else do you want?’ I mean, it’s unimaginable.”Trump, meeting with the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, on Thursday appeared to distance himself from previous remarks in which he falsely called Volodymyr Zelenskyy a dictator. “Did I say that? I can’t believe I said that,” he said, before admitting that his relationship with the Ukrainian president had got a “little testy” over financial support but was now on firmer ground.Trump once again had to be corrected by a European leader when he falsely claimed Europe was getting back the money it had given for Ukraine’s defence. Starmer said: “We’re not getting all of ours. I mean, quite a bit of ours was gifted. It was given. There were some loans, but mainly it was gifted actually.” Emmauel Macron, the French president, interjected on the same point when he met with Trump on Monday.Russian forces staged mass strikes late on Thursday on energy targets in the Kharkiv region of north-eastern Ukraine, the regional governor said. Oleh Syniehubov said one man was injured in a Russian attack on the town of Balakliia, south-east of Kharkiv. Ukraine’s air force reported threats of attacks by glide bombs and drones in the region.North Korea has sent more soldiers to Russia and redeployed several to the frontline in Kursk, the South Korean spy agency told Agence France-Presse on Thursday. “The exact scale is still being assessed,” an official said. Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson Georgiy Tykhy said: “This is, I think, a wake-up call for everyone globally to understand that the security of Europe and the Indo-Pacific has never been more directly linked than it is today. We don’t think that the reaction of the international community has been sufficient.”Nato allies to Ukraine are preparing billions more in aid and contributions to security guarantees, the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, said on Thursday, adding he had had a great talk with Donald Trump.The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has insisted there will be no more negotiations over a critical minerals and resources deal that the Trump administration is expecting Volodymyr Zelenskyy to sign when he arrives in Washington on Friday. Bessent said the deal was complete.Two researchers at France’s main state research agency were sentenced on Thursday to eight months in prison for throwing improvised explosive devices at the Russian consulate in Marseille in protest at Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

By carefully repositioning itself, and by encouraging countries to submit relevant, modish entries, Eurovision has transformed into the party of the year.

The Guardian,Trump and Starmer sat side by side – and the gulf between two nations seemed wider than ever | Gaby Hinsliff,"The US president’s day of diplomacy involved an alleged rapist, a claimed trafficker and then Britain’s PM. It said everything about our new eraShortly after Keir Starmer arrived in Washington to fight for the future of Europe, two men who make a mockery of everything he stands for touched down on American soil. The toxic YouTube influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate have spent years under investigation in Romania on charges of rape and human trafficking, which they deny, Andrew is now wanted by British police over allegations of rape, and both brothers for tax evasion in this country. But to MAGAworld they are martyrs, unjustly persecuted abroad for the crime of saying what they think on the internet.Sitting beside Starmer, Trump protested that he knew ‘nothing about’ the Tates’ triumphant homecoming, though it follows reported US diplomatic pressure on the Romanian government to lift its travel ban and Andrew Tate has bragged of his friendship with the president’s son. But it was a small, stark reminder of just how far apart our two continents have become. It’s freedom of speech that reliably seems to galvanise Trumpworld, not the freedom of millions of Europeans to live in peace along Russia’s borders; as the president breezily told his cabinet this week, “we’ll have Europe take care of that”. Yet on the crucial question Starmer brought to Washington - of whether America will in turn take care of its old allies, offering the military backup without which its forces will be dangerously exposed - the best that could be said for Trump’s answer was that it wasn’t the anticipated outright no, and even that may come with trade-related strings attached.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,I ran Britain’s army. I know what it needs. Don’t cut aid to fund defence | Richard Dannatt,"History shows targeted aid reduces the burden on the military. Labour is risking the very security we are trying to ensureGen Lord Dannatt is a former chief of the general staffStarmer’s cut to aid budget a ‘strategic mistake’, says former army headThe world is more dangerous today than at any time since the cold war. Russia’s ongoing aggression in Ukraine, tensions in the Indo-Pacific, and instability in the Middle East demand that Britain steps up. Our armed forces must be properly funded to meet these threats, and increasing defence spending to 2.5% of GDP is a welcome and necessary move.But we need to go further and faster to meet the challenges we face. Britain’s military capabilities must be strengthened to deter aggression, safeguard our interests and maintain a credible global presence. But cutting aid to fund it is a fundamental strategic error that risks making us weaker, not stronger. Funding one out of the money allocated to the other risks undermining the very security we are trying to ensure. Continue reading...","Thu, 27 Feb 2025 17:13:11 GMT",-0.1779,-0.9627
The Guardian,Gene Hackman: the star of every scene he was in,"From The Conversation to The Royal Tenenbaums, the actor rode America’s new wave to become the gold standard for characterful acting with heft• Gene Hackman found dead with his wife – news• Gene Hackman – a life in pictures• Gene Hackman – obituaryAs the movie ends, our point of view pans slowly, relentlessly, back and forth like a security camera across the trashed apartment. It has been ripped apart floorboard by floorboard in a doomed attempt to find the bugging device spying on the guy who lives there. With every sweep, the man is seen in the corner, playing the sax. Fatalistic, but not exactly despairing; realistic but not precisely disillusioned – the craftsman who is an artist at heart, nonchalant, magnificent. Gene Hackman’s performance as surveillance expert Harry Caul in Francis Coppola’s paranoid conspiracy drama The Conversation (1974) was a jewel in his career. Caul is a pro eavesdropper who becomes obsessed with a conversation he records for a mysterious client that, to his horror, reveals a murder plot – unlocking his own private agonies of guilt and loneliness. The film turns on some variants of intonation and pitch that Harry doesn’t understand until it’s too late.The death of Gene Hackman marks the end of one of the greatest periods of US cinema: the American new wave. Hackman was the gold standard for this era, ever since Warren Beatty gave him his big break with the role of Buck Barrow in Arthur Penn’s Bonnie and Clyde (1967). He was the character actor who was really a star; in fact the star of every scene he was in – that tough, wised-up, intelligent but unhandsome face perpetually on the verge of coolly unconcerned derision, or creased in a heartbreakingly fatherly, pained smile. He wasn’t gorgeous like Redford or dangerously sexy like Nicholson, or even puckish like Hoffman; Hackman was normal, but his normality was steroidally supercharged. His hair was of its age: frizzy, with evident male-pattern baldness. You really don’t get star haircuts like that any more. Continue reading...","Thu, 27 Feb 2025 09:25:46 GMT",0.0,0.7942

The reference price for his £7.5m-worth of “golden hello” shares – the cost of extracting him from the world of private equity – was 91p. The engine-maker’s share price is now 732p, up 16% on Thursday’s ultra-bullish full-year report, meaning the value of Erginbilgiç’s signing-on package has inflated to a princely £60m.

The Guardian,Welcome back Billy McFarland and a new Fyre festival. Shows you can’t keep a good fantasist down,"Fresh out of jail, does it matter that his 2017 festival was one of the biggest social-media-driven deceptions of our time? Not a bit“Since 2016, Fyre has been the most talked about festival in the world,” organiser Billy McFarland told a US broadcaster when tickets for Fyre 2 went on sale this week. McFarland was sentenced to six years in prison for wire fraud in 2018, related to his organisation of the first Fyre (he served only four). Whatever you think about the first Fyre – with its limp cheese sandwiches, its disaster-relief-tent accommodation, the absence of advertised headliners, the $26m of unpaid debt, the rats (were the rats influencer hyperbole? Perhaps, but on the other hand the festival happened on the parking lot of an abandoned resort development, and where else is a rat supposed to live?), you have to admit it lived up to one promise: it was legendary.Wire fraud is any swindling that happens electronically, whether by text, email, phone or social media. It’s so easy to fall on the wrong side of that – you could commit it just by sending a round robin, asking for a million dollars. Really, all that is standing between so many of us and jail is the sucker who will give us a million dollars. It’s really the suckers who belong in prison, if you think about it. Anyway, back to McFarland. “Obviously, a lot of that [talk] has been negative … but if it’s done well, I think Fyre has the chance to be this annual festival that really takes over the festival industry,” he said.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on pornography: the Obscene Publications Act needs an update | Editorial,"A new report makes a convincing case for outlawing strangulation imagery – and putting the home secretary in chargeIt is news to nobody that the internet has enabled an unprecedented explosion of pornographic material. There is widespread awareness, too, that much of this is far more violent than used to be the norm in adult sexual publishing and entertainment – with more extreme content understood to drive engagement, as it does across the internet. The UK’s Online Safety Act should block children from accessing disturbing and unsuitable content. It is shameful that age-verification legislation took so long.The independent report on pornography delivered to ministers this week ought to be the next step in a national effort to deal with the proliferation of online sexual violence. As Peter Kyle, the science secretary, said on Thursday, it is an authoritative piece of work. When he meets its author, Gabby Bertin, next week, he should commit to act on her recommendations. Draft guidance from Ofcom, regarding material currently defined as legal but harmful, is under consultation. But Lady Bertin is right to demand that ministers go further. While clear-sighted about the disproportionate harms to women, she notes, too, the dangers to boys and men, and highlights the prospect that problematic pornography use could be classed as an addiction.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But a lasting resolution will require greater rights for Kurds After four decades of violence that have claimed at least 40,000 lives, this was a momentous declaration. On Thursday, the leader of the Kurdish insurgency, Abdullah Öcalan, revered by his supporters, called on fighters to lay down arms. In a written statement from his prison cell – he has been held in isolation for a quarter of a century – he urged his Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) not only to disarm but to dissolve itself.Yet optimism must be tempered. Ten years ago, a two-year truce between the militant group and the Turkish state imploded and some of the worst violence of the long conflict ensued.

The Guardian,FA Cup fifth round: 10 things to look out for this weekend,"VAR is back (to save us all), Plymouth are plotting another upset and Cardiff’s Anwar El Ghazi returns to Villa ParkThe trip to Aston Villa looks tricky for Cardiff City, whose main focus is avoiding relegation to League One. Anwar El Ghazi, at least, was delighted with the draw. The Dutchman spent four years at Villa, clinching promotion at Wembley at the end of a loan season in 2018-19 before a permanent move from Lille. El Ghazi scored Villa’s first goal in a playoff final victory over Derby, with John McGinn and Tyrone Mings the only survivors from that team. Both clubs’ futures hinged on that game under the arch: Derby spiralled and faced administration before dropping into the third tier. El Ghazi can count on a hero’s welcome at Villa Park on Friday. Villa, who will visit Club Brugge for a Champions League last 16 first-leg tie on Tuesday, hope to advance to the FA Cup quarter-finals for the first time since ending as runners-up to Arsenal 10 years ago.

Solo, he has variously spawned an entire sub-genre more or less singlehanded (the sample-heavy sound of his acclaimed 2007 album Person Pitch effectively gave birth to chillwave), collaborated with Daft Punk, Solange, Paramore and Jamie xx, commissioned dub albums from On-U Sound’s Adrian Sherwood, and dabbled in a stark acoustic sound on 2019’s Buoys.Lennox and Kember’s collaborative album, Reset, united two generations of psychedelic experimentalists in a charmingly playful musical dialogue. Among its delights was a track called Whirlpool. It sounded beatific and blissed-out, but on closer examination seemed to depict a failing relationship: Lennox later confirmed that his marriage to fashion designer Fernanda Pereira – who directed the videos that accompanied Reset – had collapsed.

She was a fifth season addition to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, taking on the role of Buffy’s mysterious sister Dawn, a complicated, maturing young woman who came to occupy a central role in the series’ mythology. Four years later, she began a recurring role on Gossip Girl, as the Cruella-squared pot-stirrer Georgina Sparks, whom Trachtenberg once described as “basically the evil bitch from hell”.With their very different aesthetics and intended audiences, Trachtenberg’s two hit series speak to very different parts of her fanbase: Buffy has a campy, B-movie charm, whereas Gossip Girl is as slick and indulgent as a delicious dessert. As those two shows indicate, her career defied easy generalisation – what to say of the woman who had her breakout role aged 11 in Harriet the Spy, before moving on to the racy teen raunchfest EuroTrip and the wholesome Disney banger Ice Princess?

Which is to say, I have history with this dish. It feels familiar, comforting and overwhelmingly wholesome, yet I don’t often eat it these days, not least because I’ve never found one commercially that makes any welfare claims for the chicken concerned (and I’m generally too cheap to make it myself).So I was quite excited about this particular taste test – and perhaps inevitably disappointed that even the most expensive samples gave so little information about the provenance of their meat. That said, with a handful of exceptions, the standard was pretty high flavour-wise, and Aldi, Marks &amp; Spencer, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s all at least note that they use British chicken, which is a start.

It has always been painfully awkward. I feel mortified whenever there’s a requirement to dance, even if it’s as silly as when the grownups join in during a kid’s party!

The Guardian,‘I was causing harm’: author Helen Jukes on motherhood and our polluted bodies,"In her latest book, Mother Animal, the writer gives a personal account of the impact of ‘forever chemicals’ on her and her child during and after pregnancyWhen Helen Jukes told her friends she was writing about motherhood and pollution, they advised her against it and warned she might make pregnant people more anxious than they already were. But she disagreed. Mother Animal, a personal account of Jukes’ pregnancy and early years of motherhood, details her growing realisation of how contaminated her body, and her baby, have become. And it’s something she thinks all would-be parents should be more aware of. There are chemicals from human industry in breast milk, amniotic fluid and bones, she writes. Toxicologists have found “forever chemicals” in embryos and foetuses at “every stage of pregnancy … in lung tissues, in livers”. It is inescapable.Yet it is spoken about far too little. “I find it quite disrespectful to think that mothers wouldn’t be capable of handling [this] information,” she says when we meet at her home on the edge of the Peak District.

The Guardian,Saldaña squished and Chalamet chafing as Ariana and Cynthia bag the best seats: the 2025 Oscars class photo,"The Academy Award nominees assembled for their annual group portrait, but who scooped the prize for looking the most bored?Every year during Oscars week, it has become tradition for all the nominees to meet up and eat a meal together. This is usually followed by a group photo; something that the people in attendance can look back upon and cherish, knowing that for this one moment all competition fell away and they found joy in surrounding themselves with their gifted colleagues.At least that’s the idea. As anyone who has ever been in a group photo will attest, these things are an absolute mess. There are simply too many people to control, and the resulting image is generally a free-for-all of weird costumes, odd expressions and seemingly hostile body language. As such, let’s use this year’s Oscars class photo to hand out some awards of our own. Continue reading...","Wed, 26 Feb 2025 13:04:20 GMT",0.6369,0.9319
The Guardian,‘I don’t want it to die’: one man’s battle to save the last phone box in his village,"In 1935, Derek Harris was born – and so was the K6 red phone box. Now, Harris is spending his 90th year ensuring this beloved local facility isn’t lostThe battleground at the heart of a struggle between an 89-year-old man and a multi-billion pound multinational is a small junction in a Norfolk village, where a red phone box stands. And at the red phone box, sheltering from the wind, is Derek Harris. Last month, he learned that BT (formerly British Telecom) was threatening to close the phone box in the village of Sharrington, where he has lived for 50 years, when he saw it on the agenda of the parish council meeting. “I thought: ‘I’d better do something about this,’” says Harris.He has described it as a “David and Goliath” campaign. It is that, and – as becomes clear on this sunlit but biting February day – so much more. We will talk mortality and reprieves, heritage and value. I’ll leave with a renewed sense of how it’s possible to feel real affection for an inanimate object, and why having a mission matters.

By 2016, he was the proud owner of a Tesla, revelling in the thumbs up he would get from other drivers as he whizzed along Europe’s highways in the electric vehicle.But of late the sheen of owning a Tesla has begun to wear off. For years the brand has been synonymous with Elon Musk and his stance against the climate crisis. Recently, Schwede watched aghast as the Tesla CEO poured hundreds of millions into backing Donald Trump as he made promises to ramp up domestic oil and gas production.
