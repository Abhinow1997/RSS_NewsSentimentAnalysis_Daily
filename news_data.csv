After one woman at the table said she was considering travelling to Avignon for a rally in support of Gisèle Pelicot, another stood up, introduced herself and said she would like to come along.Six days later, six women from the workshop made the six-hour trip to Avignon together in a rented car. They were intent on joining the many expressing their horror after Dominique Pelicot, one of the worst sex offenders in modern French history, was accused of drugging his then wife and inviting dozens of men to rape her over the course of a decade.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

The Guardian,Charlie Cooper’s Myth Country: Winter Solstice review – at times this folklore profile is tear-inducingly pure,"The humour is less slick than its predecessor, but Cooper’s exploration of ancient British traditions reveals more of him as a result – making it an upliftingly joyful watchCall me a canker-hearted old cynic – you would, after all, be correct – but I have a tiny suspicion that Charlie Cooper’s Myth Country: Winter Solstice was thrown together in a rush after the unexpected fondness for his original three-part series on British folklore. Certainly it is more chaotic and less polished than the first episodes – even though they had what we might lovingly call a Heath Robinson-esque vibe themselves.A large part of the original series’ charm was in the blurring between Charlie Cooper and Kurtan, the character he plays in his and his sister Daisy’s near-perfect bittersweet comedy This Country. There were lines so perfectly fitting for the latter that you became intrigued as to quite what was going on. Are Charlie and Kurtan in fact one and the same thing? Perhaps Daisy is a master puppeteer, simply dropping her brother into sets and letting the cameras roll while she improvises her Kerry lines around him? Or perhaps Charlie is simply the greatest actor since Richard Burbage, performing a seamless transformation before our very eyes? Continue reading...","Fri, 20 Dec 2024 22:30:01 GMT",0.0,0.9922
The Guardian,The 50 best albums of 2024: No 1 – Charli xcx: Brat (and Brat and It’s Completely Different But Also Still Brat),"Smart, funny, moving and full of big tunes, the in-your-face masterpiece was the right album at the right time, striking a cultural nerve and defining the changing zeitgeist• The 50 best albums of 2024• More on the best culture of 2024In 2022, Charli xcx released Crash, an album that she claimed was a deliberate “sellout”. An artist who had previously seemed hell-bent on singlehandedly dragging pop music into a more interesting, experimental space by sheer force of will – on her acclaimed 2017 mixtape Pop 2, she collaborated with Estonian “post-Soviet” rappers, Brazilian drag queens and the extravagantly foul-mouthed underground artist CupcakKe – had apparently decided not to bother any more. She gamely presented Crash as another experiment in “making a major-label album the way it’s actually done” and knowingly embracing “everything that the life of a pop figurehead has to offer in today’s world – celebrity, obsession and global hits”, but you somehow sensed her heart wasn’t quite in it. Moreover, it didn’t totally work – it was well reviewed and became Charli’s first UK No 1 album, but didn’t exactly produce “global hits”.What Charli subsequently described as a deadening experience lit a fire under its author: if playing the game was no fun, then why not do exactly as you please? Certainly, Charli xcx’s sixth album turned out to be everything Crash wasn’t, up to and including the defining pop album of the year. Instead of a sleeve featuring the singer in a bikini, as Crash did, Brat came wrapped in a blunt, lowercase rendering of the album’s title against a sickly lime green: intended as a snub to the “misogynistic and boring” assumption that a female artist should automatically appear on her own album cover, it turned out to be a masterstroke of branding far more pervasive than any glossy photo, even influencing the US presidential race. Its sound was brash and aggressive, early 00s London club music – electroclash, acid-y bloghouse, dubstep, maximalist rave synths – shot through a chattering, trebly hyperpop filter: “Club classic but I still pop,” as Von Dutch put it. It oozed self-possession and confidence, Brat seemed to swagger even as Charli confessed to insecurity or inadequacy, a cocktail of emotions that seemed to be at the album’s centre: if everyone feels like this, you might as well own it.

The Guardian,Best films of 2024 in the UK: No 1 – All of Us Strangers,"Andrew Haigh’s devastating metaphysical drama follows a lonely gay writer as he interacts with the ghosts of his parentsAndrew Scott on starring in All of StrangersThe best films of 2024 in the UKUnderneath the radical swoon of Andrew Haigh’s ground-shifting gay drama Weekend was a swell of sadness. Clearer in the film’s more universal right-people-wrong-time romance but also in the more specific, and knottier, queerness. It was a rare, giddy uplift to see young gay men fall headfirst for each other with such believable and unfettered intimacy but their affection existed in a world full of caveats – where to kiss, how to act, who to be – and it was only in privacy that they could really be themselves. “When I’m at home I’m absolutely fine,” Tom Cullen’s Russell says. “I’m happy being gay … It’s when I go outside …”Twelve years later in All of Us Strangers, Haigh’s first film about gay characters since, what lies outside has dramatically changed. Same-sex marriage has been legalised. Gay culture at large has been more widely embraced, from Heartstopper to Queer Eye to Drag Race. It has, allegedly, got better. But for Andrew Scott’s lonely gay writer, Adam, things remain troubled on the inside, a fix to the political not enough to mend the personal, living like Cullen’s Weekend protagonist before him, in a high-rise far away from everyone and everything else. This time it’s not just on the edge of a city but on the edge of the world, eerily close to that of another, on the precipice between the living and the dead.

He has again earned vast fortunes but, as he prepares to climb into the ring to once more face Oleksandr Usyk in the early hours of Sunday morning in Riyadh, 2024 has until now been defined most clearly by loss. In May, Fury endured the first defeat of a professional career which began 16 years ago this month.

The Guardian,England must accept the need for ruthlessness alongside entertainment | Mark Ramprakash,"Ben Stokes seems wary of using the word ‘ruthless’ but it is the one thing talented players need to become a truly great teamSometimes I feel this England team can’t take two steps forward without doing something that makes me think they’ve gone backwards. So much progress has been made, so many reasons for optimism provided before a year that is likely to define them. But then they end it with a display that forces me to wonder whether they have it in them to become the best in the world, to win the World Test Championship, to be more than just&nbsp;entertainers.Ben Stokes says he hates the word “ruthless”, but I am puzzled by him attaching a negative connotation to a word that is synonymous with all the greatest teams in the history of sport. No team relishes facing talented and ruthless opponents – well England have the talent, but not the attitude. This is a team that has shown they can dominate, and that they can also self-destruct.

The Guardian,"Hit TV show, tick. Millions for lawyers, tick. Now could we manage some actual justice for the subpostmasters? | Marina Hyde","The ‘big people’ implicated in this disgraceful run of events need to pay their dues. Britain needs it – and demands itIn her closing statement to the Post Office inquiry this week, Paula Vennells once again added the brutal murder of irony to her list of failings. Or as the former CEO’s lawyer put it: “She has no desire to point the finger at others.” Oh, Paula. Great to hear your pointing finger has finally been decommissioned – but it’s many years and many, many prison sentences too late for that. In fact, as we bid farewell to the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry, to give it its full name, it’s clear that the prime takeout should be: let that not be an end to it. Justice has yet to be served.It’s quite something to think that this time last year, ITV had not even aired Mr Bates vs the Post Office, the drama that finally galvanised public anger about the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British history, and led to immediate action from various classes of powerful people who could have done something before, but didn’t. As the year ends, it is possible to say that Mr Bates is now by far and away the most watched drama of 2024 – in fact, the most watched anything bar sport. Pretty sensational for something created so faultlessly and beautifully out of a dauntingly unpromising dramatic premise: a faulty computer system.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Fri, 20 Dec 2024 12:47:32 GMT",0.5267,0.9572
The Guardian,‘How do we live in this terrible world?’ a reader asked me. Here’s the only answer I have | Jonathan Freedland,"From the bloodshed in Ukraine, Sudan and Gaza to the return of Trump, there are so many reasons to despair. But a little deliberate optimism can go a long wayIt’s a season brimming with tradition and, as longtime readers may know, my own custom has been to try, in the last column before Christmas, to find a few reasons to be hopeful. I was planning on doing that anyway, but my resolve was sharpened by a conversation with a reader who called in to last weekend’s Guardian and Observer charity telethon. Tammy, who is 75, made her donation but she also had a simple, if fathomless question: “How do we live in this terrible world?”She proceeded to rattle off just some of the things that led her to put the question so starkly. She talked of the ongoing bloodshed in Ukraine, Sudan and Gaza; she sighed at the imminent return of Donald Trump.

The danger is real and incremental change won’t avert itJeremy Corbyn is independent MP for Islington North and was leader of the Labour party from 2015 to 2020There is no need to overcomplicate things: a rise in global temperatures of 3.1C is not compatible with human survival. That is where we are heading, unless we act now. On our current path, the world will exceed 1.5C of warming, and could reach a rise of 2.6-3.1C by the end of the century.For you, today, that might make the difference between wearing a jumper or a jacket. For humanity, it is the difference between survival and extinction. Paris and Berlin will bake under heatwaves. New York will be hit by frequent storm-surges.

The victories after the fall of Assad are a far easier focus Aluf Benn is the editor-in-chief of HaaretzWars are remembered by their iconic images, and finding a triumphal photograph has been a key goal for belligerents striving to leave their mark on history. On 8 December, after fighting ceaselessly for 14 months, Israel finally got its image of victory. It shows three soldiers in full combat gear posing with Israel’s Star of David-and-stripes flag on a mountaintop against the cloudy sky. The IDF’s special forces captured the highest peak of Mount Hermon in Syria, explained the caption, overlooking Damascus and the Golan Heights.Mere hours after the flight of Syria’s deposed despot, Bashar al-Assad, Israel launched a quick attack to capture the formerly demilitarised zone across the disengagement line that has marked the de facto Israel-Syrian border since 1974, pushing its conquest up to the Hermon peak. The land grab, which met no resistance, was coupled with a massive bombing campaign to destroy the dangerous assets left behind by the ousted regime’s military: jet fighters and helicopters, warships, missile factories and storage facilities, air defence systems, research and development laboratories. All were targeted lest they fall into enemy hands.Aluf Benn is the editor-in-chief of HaaretzDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Please give generously• Donate to our charity appeal hereWars in Gaza, Sudan, Ukraine and elsewhere have made 2024 a brutal and bloody 12 months. For this year’s Guardian and Observer appeal, in aid of three conflict-linked charities, we are asking readers to give out of compassion for those affected, and in the hope of promoting peace in a safer world. As well as alleviating immediate suffering, and saving lives, our voluntary-sector partners play a vital role in helping to restore civil society in places where it is devastated by conflict. Their work with children, in particular, is essential to efforts to build a better future.The year began with fierce fighting and mass displacements in southern Gaza. February saw the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while April marked a year since fighting broke out in Sudan between the military and Rapid Support Forces rebels. In each country civilians have suffered terrible losses. Children in the occupied territories are regarded by the UN as having faced human rights violations on an “unprecedented scale”. Reports from Ukraine and Sudan have included horrifying evidence about the use of rape and sexual torture as weapons of war, among other forms of violence.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on celebrity books: call them by their names | Editorial,"Keira Knightley and Jamie Oliver are the latest stars to write children’s books, but too often famous names hide the talents of ghostwritersThere is nothing new about stars trying their hand at children’s fiction (Julie Andrews published Mandy back in 1971). But the announcement in October that Keira Knightley has written and illustrated her first children’s novel, billed as “a modern classic”, was met with anger among children’s writers who took to social media to joke that they wanted to become film stars. The written word can be a tricky thing to navigate for the untutored. Jamie Oliver was forced to pull his new title Billy and the Epic Escape after it was criticised for perpetuating harmful stereotypes and “trivialising painful histories” of First Nations people.There is understandable frustration from other authors, who feel they are being crowded out of press coverage and bookshops. Sometimes it is unclear who is actually writing the titles. It is no surprise that many memoirs are ghostwritten – no one really thought Prince Harry toiled for months to write Spare. A celebrity’s life story belongs to them, after all, so it doesn’t seem so problematic that a professional writer is hired to tell it. But who owns an idea or fictional&nbsp;narrative?

The Guardian,Cochlear implants make a useful addition to sign language | Letters,"Parents of a deaf child should not feel pressured to choose between implants and signing, writes Dr Wyatte Hall, while Simon Gair agonised over implants for three of his children. Plus letters from Ruth Holt and Jenny FroudeAs a deaf researcher focused on language deprivation among deaf individuals, I am often asked about cochlear implants and their role in the lives of deaf children (The cochlear question: as the parent of a deaf baby, should I give her an implant to help her hear?, 11 December). While cochlear implants are a technological tool that provides access to sound, the critical issue is not the implant itself, but the decision to exclude signed languages from a deaf child’s upbringing.Language is a fundamental human right and the foundation of cognitive, social and emotional development. For deaf children, access to a visual language – such as American Sign Language or British Sign Language (BSL) – is essential, particularly in the early years when the brain is most receptive to language acquisition. Without this access, many deaf children can face significant delays in language development, which leads to lifelong challenges in education, employment and mental health.

The painting was not damaged, although there was damage to the frame. Holland was sentenced to 20 months in prison. They sent this letter to the Guardian about their experience behind bars.It was a shock at first that the judge had gone to the extreme of our sentence. The first few days and nights in prison were hard but also such an education.

Almost a week after its worst storm in 90 years, France’s poorest territory still has shortages of water. Continue reading...","Fri, 20 Dec 2024 16:24:39 GMT",-0.5423,-0.9631

When the drizzly season hits, it’s the weatherproof saviour that makes leaving the house just about bearable. Beyond practicalities, though, it’s also an important style choice.

The Guardian,"Aliens, Gollum and talking raccoons: when will the Oscars finally reward mo-cap acting?","Some in the industry have been calling for recognition for years, but motion-capture performances by the likes of Zoe Saldana have been ignored. Now, though, the Academy must look to the futurePicture the future: it’s the Oscars 2034, and the best actor prizes are no longer split into male and female categories. Instead, there is an award for best performer in a live action role, and another for best actor in a performance capture role. Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks can finally go head-to-head for their epic turns in Sophie’s Choice II and Even Bigger respectively, while Zoe Saldana and Andy Serkis are up for the latter for their startling performances in Avatar 6 and The Lord of the Rings: What Gollum Did Last Summer.Some might suggest this is a tantalising vision of a world where the Academy has finally caught up with the realities of modern acting. Others would no doubt point out that the Oscars has been rewarding work where the actor’s real face is obscured by makeup, prosthetics, masks, or other transformations for decades, ever since John Hurt received a best actor nod for The Elephant Man in 1980. The difference is that while Robert Downey Jr somehow managed to snag a nomination for playing an Australian method actor donning blackface in the biting 2008 satirical comedy Tropic Thunder, the likes of Avatar’s Saldana and Lord of the Rings’ Serkis seem doomed to Oscars limbo, as they pour their hearts repeatedly into roles only to watch awards season roll by like an indifferent Na’vi riding a banshee past a crying Jake Sully.

The Guardian,Dead Hard review – yippee ki-why bother?,"CoLab theatre, LondonHands Grubby takes over Nakablowme Tower in a slapdash camp parody of Die HardThe status of Die Hard as a Christmas movie is contested. The quality of this live adaptation is, alas, less debatable. The show takes place on the fifth floor of an office block by Southwark Bridge, masquerading as floor 30 of (deep breath) “Nakablowme” Tower. Terrorists have taken over, led by louche villain Hands Grubby, clad for no apparent reason in sequinned jacket and fishnets. Step forward macho Noo Yawk cop John McClean to save the day, and to connect with his closeted sexuality via a romance with a PC from South Croydon seemingly styled by the Village People.We’re in the realm of camp action-movie parody then, in a show that bids for the boozy and forgiving Christmas crowd, wanting a knees-up more than a play. The problem is that, in Bertie Watkins’ production, neither is satisfactorily delivered. Dead Hard’s immersive element is weak and swiftly dispatched, as Nakablowme’s CEO orchestrates two audience-participation games involving dildos (the show is obsessed with dildos) and other phallic appendages. Thereafter, we sit in a studio theatre and passively watch the show unfold. Continue reading...","Fri, 20 Dec 2024 18:00:02 GMT",-0.7964,-0.9566

Well, the film world might not have witnessed a Barbenheimer-sized cultural event in 2024, but there were plenty of box office success stories: notably Dune: Part Two, Deadpool and Wolverine, Inside Out 2 and Wicked. As that list suggests, sequels were the dominant mode as a panicky Hollywood stuck to tried and trusted ideas – though that old safe bet, the superhero movie, continued to generally struggle this year.

It’s as grimly compelling as picking a scabThe new Amazon gameshow Beast Games comes with an awful lot of baggage. At the age of 26, MrBeast has more YouTube subscribers than anyone alive. He is the third most followed person on TikTok. He has put his name to restaurants, chocolates, toys, clothes and Nerf guns. His fame among young people is genuinely unfathomable. In short, he needs television a lot less than television needs him.However, since the show went into production, the wheels have fallen off somewhat. In September, five Beast Games contestants filed a 54-page class action lawsuit against MrBeast’s production company and Amazon, alleging widespread mistreatment, , inadequate compensation and “serious emotional distress, including suffering, anguish, fright, horror, nervousness, anxiety, […] worry, shock, humiliation, and/or shame”.

The Guardian,"Long Chim, London W1: ‘A startlingly brief menu of crowd pleasers’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants","‘Long chim’ translates loosely as ‘come and try’, and you literally could try everything here on a single visitLong Chim in Soho is a new restaurant by the chef David Thompson, the man who changed the face of Thai food in the UK back in the early noughties. You’ll hear this repeated by chefs and food writers whenever Thompson’s name is mentioned, and his work genuinely warrants genuflection. Without him, it is said, there would be no Som Saa, no Kiln, no Smoking Goat, no Speedboat Bar, nor many of those other hip Thai eating spots run by earnest boys called Crispin who serve kipper curry to other earnest boys called Crispin.Thompson did not by any means invent the concept of Thai people eating – they’ve been managing perfectly well by themselves since the country was created in the 13th century – but he certainly dismantled the UK’s love of gelatinous yet sating pad Thais and of boiled chicken pieces swimming in tinned coconut milk and masquerading as green curry. When he opened Nahm in 2001, Thompson laughed in the face of the predictable, cosy and safe Thai food we’d been used to – comforting sweetness and nuttiness, with gentle, fragrant wafts of coriander and unthreatening heat – and instead favoured scallops, pigeon, Asian celery, white pepper and often alarmingly bold levels of both fresh and dried chillies.

No cars dare use the wide boulevard any more because the road is still watched by Kurdish snipers allied to the regime. The units retreated into the warren of bombed and burnt-out buildings when Islamist rebel groups launched an unprecedented attack on the city at the end of November, triggering a chain reaction that led to the swift collapse of the Assad dynasty.Civilians hurry past, some with small children in pushchairs, others rolling cooking gas canisters down the road, all trying not to attract undue attention. A man had been shot and killed here the night before, picked off from the upper floor of a windowless apartment block. Aleppo fell to an umbrella of Sunni Arab factions led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) three weeks ago, but the Kurdish units stationed in Sheikh Maqsoud refused to surrender when HTS came in, afraid of what would happen if they surrendered.

The Guardian,Humphrey’s world: how the Samuel Smith beer baron built Britain’s strangest pub chain,"Since the 1970s, Humphrey Smith has acquired scores of pubs and historic properties around the UK. But time after time, he has left the buildings empty. Why has he allowed his empire to moulder?In early September 2022, Alivia Bienko and her husband, Liam, were driving through Stamford Bridge, an idyllic village on the River Derwent, near York, when a shuttered pub caught their eye. Stuck to one of the windows was an A4 sheet advertising for a couple to live in and manage the pub. On the advert was a mobile number for Samuel Smith, the brewery that owned the pub. Founded in 1758, Samuel Smith Old Brewery is one of the largest family-owned brewery and pub operations in the UK. Bienko had experience in hospitality, and she and Liam were open to a change. They decided to look into the job.Online, they came across a few stories of couples who had been thrown out of their jobs running Samuel Smith’s pubs, largely for “missing money or missing beer”, Bienko said. Nothing unusual about that. But when the couple dialled the number on the advert, they were surprised to find themselves speaking to Humphrey Smith, the stupendously wealthy chairman of the company, who has been in charge since the 1970s. “He said, ‘I can come and meet you tomorrow’,” Bienko told me. “It was very odd and we were very nervous, because we were living in a small caravan and here was a millionaire coming to visit us.” Continue reading...","Thu, 19 Dec 2024 05:00:06 GMT",0.0,-0.7564
