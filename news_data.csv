Our critic is wowed by the buttery stonework, gleaming lead and gawp-inducing gildingWith France plunged into political turmoil, and president Emmanuel Macron’s approval ratings at an all time low, the country might be thankful to have a distraction of epic proportions this weekend. All eyes will be on Notre Dame tomorrow, as Paris prepares to unveil the interior of its hallowed cathedral, “the soul of France” finally resurrected following a meticulous five-year, €700m (£582m) restoration.The herculean project has seen 2,000 oak trees gathered from forests across France, hewn into beams with axes and pegged into great trusses by hand using medieval tools. It has witnessed over a thousand cubic metres of limestone being hauled into place, chiselled into leaping arches and gurning gargoyles, as well as 4,000 square metres of lead, rolled, crimped and moulded into ornamental roofing. It has also been the stage for a celebrity wallet-waving spectacle, seeing French luxury goods billionaires racing to outdo each other in the size of their donations – reaching almost €900m (£749m) just two days after the fire, endowing the cathedral with a substantial maintenance kitty for years to come.

The Guardian,The Last Days of Liz Truss? review – endgame at No 10 is tip of the iceberg,"White Bear theatre, LondonThe former PM’s brief tenure is raked over to seriocomic effect in Greg Wilkinson’s play, which raises major political questionsA running length of 100 minutes for The Last Days of Liz Truss? amounts to about two minutes for each day its subject served as prime minister. By the same measure, a drama about Margaret Thatcher – Truss’s heroine, her portrait hanging from the set – would last almost a week. That would be a sum as untenable as those in the budget that led to a premiership of such brevity, whereas this monologue written by Greg Wilkinson enjoyably justifies its economics.Truss’s time in the post in 2022 has already been detailed in four books including her own Ten Years to Save the West, Anthony Seldon’s Truss at No 10: How Not to Be Prime Minister, Tim Shipman’s Out and Kingmaker by Sir Graham Brady, who as chair of the 1922 committee, was the Tory executioner. Having read them all (a slightly alarming realisation), I can testify that Wilkinson has expertly filleted the history to comic (the politician’s passion for karaoke) and serious (her apocalyptic patriotism and economics) effect.

Unfortunately, Gabriel-as-knitwear is about as entertaining as it gets in this fairly straightforward biblical adaptation of the early years of Mary, mother of Christ.Actually that’s not quite fair. Anthony Hopkins as Herod understands the assignment, bellowing lines such as “KNEEEEEEEL!” with requisite gusto. We’ve seen him serve more fully flavoured ham before, however, in lavish tosh like The Silence of the Lambs sequels Hannibal and Red Dragon; this is more ham-lite, the sort of villainy Hopkins can deliver in his sleep.

Just don’t ask her about Bake Off ...‘A lot of famous people are arseholes,” says Sandi Toksvig. “I don’t like people because they are famous or rich. My father was incredibly famous, the most famous man in Denmark. So I’ve seen it up close and have no interest in fame whatsoever.” I have been talking with Toksvig – broadcaster; quizshow host; author of plays, musicals and 30 or so books; pioneering feminist and LGBTQ+ activist – about her role as officiator at the wedding of Abba’s Björn Ulvaeus to his partner, Christina Sas, in September. Ulvaeus is indeed famous and rich but is firmly “not in the arsehole category. He is a good friend, very gentle and a humanist like me.” Claus Toksvig, who was a broadcaster and foreign correspondent – essentially Denmark’s answer to Richard Dimbleby – wasn’t in the arsehole category, either. He and his daughter were extremely close and he would take her on work jaunts, one of which, astonishingly, involved watching Neil Armstrong walk on the moon from Houston’s Apollo Mission Control Center.That Claus was so famous “should have steered me in the opposite direction”, says Toksvig, adding: “I didn’t set out to do what I did.” But while studying law, archaeology and anthropology at Cambridge – her plan was to become a human-rights lawyer – Toksvig joined Footlights, the university’s comedy society, “for a laugh. And a director saw me and said: ‘Come and work with me,’ and so I thought, ‘OK, I’ll do that and treat it like another gap year.’ And that was 45 years ago. I’m having the longest gap year in history.” Continue reading...","Fri, 06 Dec 2024 14:00:58 GMT",0.0,0.991

The manager refuses to believe there is an “institutionalised” reason for the club to fall short of their targets and said he would never “palm off responsibility to whatever we’re going through to things that have existed in the past”.But as he looked forward to Sunday’s derby at home to Chelsea, he lingered on the frustration of Thursday’s 1-0 defeat at Bournemouth. After it, some of the travelling support directed abuse at him. What drove Postecoglou to distraction was how, after a reasonable start, his team conceded at the first sign of pressure – allowing Dean Huijsen a free run to head in from a 17th-minute corner.

The Guardian,Talking Horses: O’Neill keeps it in the family as Bill Joyce surges to Winter Novice Hurdle,"Bill Joyce’s win at Sandown on Friday was the O’Neill yard’s second Grade Two win in the space of a fortnightDan Skelton and Paul Nicholls have already broken well clear of the pack in the race to reclaim the UK trainers’ championship from Willie Mullins, but they could only stand and watch from the minor spots in the winner’s enclosure here on Friday as Jonjo O’Neill’s resurgent stable – with his son, AJ, now also on the licence – claimed the Grade Two Winter Novice Hurdle with Bill Joyce.O’Neill Sr has saddled winners of the Cheltenham Gold Cup and, most famously, the Grand National, giving Tony McCoy his much-delayed winner of the Aintree showpiece in 2010. But having finished fifth in the championship race as recently as 2020-21, his Jackdaw’s Castle estate – one of the most modern and well-equipped training complexes in the country – has bumped along in the mid-to-high teens for the past three seasons.

The Guardian,‘We speak to everyone in Spanish’: Oli McBurnie and Scott McKenna on embracing life at Las Palmas,"Scotland internationals discuss facing Real Madrid, doing ‘far less’ heading and their linguistic horror storiesSo, what was it that first attracted you to the island of Gran Canaria with its 235km of coastline, beautiful beaches, glorious golf courses, a climate where it’s 25C today, not nudging zero like back in Nottingham or Sheffield, and a football team where you can get the better of Kylian Mbappé and beat Barcelona? “Oli was here,” Scott McKenna says. There’s a smile and then the man sitting next to him starts laughing.On 25 July Unión Deportiva Las Palmas announced they had signed Oliver Robert McBurnie, the first Scottish footballer in their history, and only the second Briton after Vinny Samways, an icon on the island. Two weeks later, they had another, McKenna joining his old mate. Now here they are in the sunshine at the Barranco Seco training ground: the original odd couple. One defender, one striker. One quiet, that first line delivered deliciously deadpan, the other forever falling about. “Me and Scott are so different, opposites,” McBurnie says. “He’s so laidback. In the best possible way, he’s like a grumpy old man. I call him mi abuelo, my grandad.” Continue reading...","Fri, 06 Dec 2024 18:06:49 GMT",0.0,0.9752
The Guardian,We cannot afford for Starmer’s government to fail. Because Farage is lying in wait | Jonathan Freedland,"It is not enough for the Labour leader’s ‘milestones’ to be achieved. Voters must feel the improvement in their daily livesThis government must not fail. Let’s get that clear from the start. If Keir Starmer does not succeed, too many British voters will conclude that both the traditional parties, Labour and Conservative, have proved useless and that it is time to try something else – with that something else being nationalist populism. If this Labour government goes down, what comes next will be Faragism, either as a Reform UK-Conservative hybrid or neat and undiluted.That is what’s at stake. For evidence, you need only look at our fellow democracies suffering that precise fate. The US has turned back to Donald Trump, while France is witnessing the slow death of Emmanuel Macron’s brand of centrism, as Marine Le Pen stands by. Germany’s Social Democratic party-led coalition collapsed last month, and polls show the SPD lagging behind the far-right Alternative für Deutschland. On Thursday, Reform edged ahead of Labour in a survey for the first time – and was only two points behind the Conservatives. And that’s before Elon Musk has handed over a penny of the $100m (£78m) he is said to be mulling as a gift to Reform – money that, as we know from his outsized role in last month’s US election, can make a big difference. Britain enjoys no special immunity from this contagion. It could happen here.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Fri, 06 Dec 2024 16:34:39 GMT",-0.7845,0.2878
The Guardian,"Farewell, then, Justin Welby. Good to see that you have already forgiven yourself | Marina Hyde","The archbishop of Banterbury could have used his speech to express remorse to victims of abuse. But then there wouldn’t have been any room for lolzI imagine the outgoing archbishop of Canterbury doesn’t have a tattoo. But if he did, he’d have that one beloved of so many insouciant people: “ONLY GOD CAN JUDGE ME.” As it goes, people with this tattoo frequently appear in court. In fact, sentencing guidelines for people with auto-satirical body art is one of only about three subjects that Justin Welby didn’t make some public comment about in his tenure as the archbishop of Canterbury.But the great pontificator is now turning in his badge and mitre, and yesterday could be found delivering a quite staggeringly tone-deaf final speech as the archbishop of Canterbury in the House of Lords. As a reminder, Welby’s resignation was called for because he definitely knew about victims of John Smyth, a sadistic monster who he had once hugely admired. Smyth’s victims, groomed and horrifically beaten, begged repeatedly – and for years – for an investigation, which the Church of England did not instigate. Many of them now state the church’s ignoring of their trauma was equal to the abuse itself.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistIn the UK, the NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

The Guardian,Compromise is a dirty word in French politics – but it may be Emmanuel Macron’s only hope | Paul Taylor,"The president needs to find a new PM to stabilise France’s standing on the world stage, even if that means turning to the Socialists Having failed to solve France’s political crisis with a prime minister dependent on the far right, President Emmanuel Macron is exploring a deal with the Socialist party (PS) to give the country a new government, pass an overdue budget and avert financial turmoil. But his room for manoeuvre is severely limited and a non-aggression pact with the centre left may be only a temporary fix.It has been a humiliating week for the centrist president, seen as a great hope for European leadership when he was first elected in 2017. Macron’s first choice of prime minister, after his impulsive dissolution of the National Assembly in June led to a hung parliament, was Michel Barnier, the EU’s master Brexit negotiator. But the silver-haired Alpine rambler failed to weave his consensus-building magic on stubborn French politicians who didn’t want to share responsibility for public spending cuts – and are already jostling for the race to succeed Macron.

The Guardian,It’s Spotify Wrapped season: a reminder of how incredibly dull streaming services have made us | Jochan Embley,"I had long Covid and Spotify was my solace – until I realised the algorithm had killed off all my curiosity about musicI asked the doctor when, if ever, I would start feeling better again. He gave a well-meaning shrug and said there was no way of knowing. I left the consultation room, put on my headphones, and opened Spotify. Prompted, as always, to listen to an album I had heard a thousand times before, I put on the Cocteau Twins record that sounds like a warm bath. The album ended, and Spotify automatically transitioned into the band’s “radio”, an algorithmically generated sprawl of other Cocteau Twins tracks and bands that sound similar. The familiarity made me feel a little bit less terrified.It wasn’t always like this. When I worked on the culture desk of a newspaper, I spent hours each week eagerly seeking out the best new music – going to gigs, scouring forums and trawling record-label rosters. Finding something exciting felt like opening a portal to a new world. Spotify’s algorithmic model, an arcane data-tangle that churns out recommendations based on previously listened-to tracks, felt bleak and synthetic by comparison. At least, that was my haughty argument. Really, I feared the algorithms would render me obsolete.Jochan Embley is a freelance writer and editor Continue reading...","Fri, 06 Dec 2024 11:14:33 GMT",-0.4576,0.8839

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Syrian turmoil: alliances shift while Assad’s grip weakens | Editorial,"With a dictatorship under pressure, a nation’s chaos could reshape regional alliances and risk broader instability across the Middle EastIs the Syrian war – the 21st century’s most protracted and second-deadliest conflict – finally nearing its end? One would not bet on it. While a coalition of rebels is closing in from the north toward the capital, Damascus, and has seized key southern border crossings, the fall of the House of Assad remains more prophecy than reality. Yet the odds of President Bashar al-Assad’s departure are shortening. The military forces that once saved his regime – Russian airpower and Hezbollah’s militant fighters – are now preoccupied in Ukraine and Lebanon. Mr Assad looks increasingly vulnerable.Since the Arab spring reached Syria in March 2011, Mr Assad’s regime has repeatedly defied predictions of collapse. Ruling through fear and intimidation, he has been credibly accused of using chemical weapons, lethal force and brutal torture against his own people. Syria would be better off without him. His fortunes seemed to shift last year when he was welcomed back into the Arab fold after a decade of isolation. Yet this return reflected the self-interest of Arab monarchs and autocrats rather than genuine reconciliation. They saw Mr Assad as a safer bet than the chaos his fall might unleash.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"‘It’s got everything you want, plus dragons’: Brandon Sanderson on the joy of writing fantasy","The hugely popular author reveals his excitement at the release of his latest Stormlight saga, how he extracted himself from Amazon and why JK Rowling should have stuck to novelsIt’s 1pm in American Fork, Utah, and the author of one of the biggest books of the year – in physical size and sales potential – is in his bedroom, having just woken up. This, it turns out, is typical. “I usually write until about 4am, then get up around noon,” Brandon Sanderson tells me over video call, leaning forward in a large chair.The Nebraska-born author has been writing through the night ever since he was a student some 25 years ago, when he spent his graveyard shifts at a hotel drafting a succession of unpublished novels. In 2005, his debut, Elantris (about religious extremists and a cursed city) was published to acclaim. His hugely successful Mistborn series (metal-fuelled wizards battle an immortal tyrant – then deal with the consequences) began a year later. But the Stormlight Archive, a saga that sits somewhere between Final Fantasy and Ragnarok with a sprinkling of Paradise Lost, is Sanderson’s defining work, accounting for more than 10 million of the 34 million copies he has sold throughout his career.

The pair won an Oscar for the original screenplay of Annie Hall, which also took the awards for best picture, best director for Allen and best actress for Diane Keaton.Allen skipped the awards ceremony, and when Brickman accepted the best writer statuette, he said: “Half of this little piece of tin, if not much more, belongs to Woody, who is probably the greatest collaborator anyone could ever wish for.

The Guardian,Songs of the Wayfarer review – a likeable hike through life and theatre,"Sadler’s Wells, LondonClaire Cunningham’s affecting solo performance is a meditation on how we find our way along unexpected pathsA dance performance that credits two mountaineering consultants – now that’s intriguing. Claire Cunningham is dressed in hiking gear: backpack, flask, a transparent pouch for a map around her neck. Her journey only takes her around the small theatre, counting steps, scaling the seats of the auditorium, finding shelter in a mountain of peaks made of tangled crutches, but her ramble becomes a meditation on finding our way along life’s unexpected paths.It’s a solo show, but Cunningham is not alone on stage. There’s her BSL interpreter, and members of the audience are invited to slouch on beanbags (all are relaxed performances, with accommodation for various access needs). We’re not to worry if our bodies – or our beanbags – make a noise, it’s all part of the landscape, she tells us in a sort of pre-expedition briefing. A person who uses crutches – as Cunningham does – expends twice as much energy as someone who doesn’t, she says, so there might be breaks. And when they come, she asks if we need to stretch, take a drink, bringing us back to our own bodies. The Scottish performer has an open, easy way of connecting, and reminds us that we’re on this trip together.At Sadler’s Wells, London, until 6 December.

The Guardian,The Spectrum review – a tactile trip to the 1980s,"This latest piece of modern vintage hardware from Retro Games Ltd makes for an astonishingly nostalgic experienceThe first time I played on a ZX Spectrum was at the Stockport branch of Debenhams, which in 1983 had an impressive home computer section that quickly turned into a sort of free creche for bored 13-year-old boys. You could hang out there for hours, typing rude Basic programs into an array of machines while the harried staff rushed about trying to stop them running. Some of the computers, however, ran games for customers to try – and this was where I encountered Manic Miner, the legendary platformer with its strange flashing visuals and surreal enemies. Speccy games looked utterly unique thanks to the machine’s idiosyncratic way of restricting 8x8 sprite maps to two colours, which meant moving objects on screen were usually collections of coloured pixel patchworks, leading to an effect known as attribute clash. Somehow, it was both ugly and beautiful – and it still is.Unpacking The Spectrum, the latest piece of modern vintage hardware from Retro Games Ltd, is an astonishingly nostalgic experience. It looks exactly how I remember the original machine: a black slab with rubber keys, each one displaying not just a number or letter, but also a Basic programming command. “Rem”, “Rand”, “Gosub”, the mystical words of the home programming era. There is a USB cable to plug it in (though you’ll need a USB plug of your own) and an HDMI lead, but no joystick. The machine is compatible with most USB gamepads – you just need to configure the buttons yourself, which takes a little time but is worth it if you can’t bear using those rubber buttons to control your games.

The Guardian,Meet the Rees-Moggs: a bluffer’s guide to the family’s weirdness,"Just in case you can’t bear to watch the former Tory MP’s new reality show, we equip you for it coming up in conversation Jacob Rees-Mogg’s new reality show may sound as appealing as flushing your entire head down a toilet. Yet Meet the Rees-Moggs (on Discovery+) is such a bewildering piece of television that it may well come up in conversation over the next few weeks. If that’s the case, here’s a handy bluffer’s guide to just how weird the former Tory MP and his family are.Jacob Rees-Mogg’s Somerset home is covered with portraits of Jacob Rees-Mogg. It is so heavily plastered with pictures of him that you will soon lose count. There’s a painting of him as an adolescent. There’s a painting of him mimicking Aaron Shikler’s John F Kennedy portrait. There’s a painting of him standing in front of another painting, which is quite Inception-y of him. The best one, though, is a painting of him that one of his six children is forced to stare at during trumpet practice.Jacob Rees-Mogg is a Greggs nut. Apparently, he says, he buys a ham and cheese baguette and a chocolate eclair for his lunch every day. He says this, however, during the election campaign and then never mentions it again after he loses his seat, so maybe it is simply a wrongheaded attempt to pander to the electorate.Jacob Rees-Mogg is a picky eater. Perhaps the Greggs infatuation is down to his bizarre eating habits. He doesn’t like yellow food, for example, and a member of his household staff points out: “He isn’t a fan of vegetables or onions or anything like that.”Jacob Rees-Mogg describes the same member of staff, a man named Shaun, as someone who “does everything that needs to be done in a busy household”. This includes “making our cider and looking after the Bentley”. His duties also appear to include scrubbing the words “posh twat” off election campaign posters and, in one instance, doing the “wanker” sign at a portrait of Robert Peel.Jacob Rees-Mogg sleeps completely still. As if he was in a tomb, he says. Chilling.Jacob Rees-Mogg quotes his election concession speech all the time. When he lost his seat this year, he quoted Chitty Chitty Bang Bang by saying: “From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success.” He also uses this exact phrase when his dog eats one of his daughter’s sausages off the floor.Jacob Rees-Mogg is sent into apoplexy by the notion of commuting badgers. During his post-election doldrums, and inspired by his daughter’s desire to emulate Carrie Johnson, he briefly entertains the idea of digging a duck pond in his garden. When the planning permission report points out that the pond might disrupt the path of commuting badgers, he throws a little tantrum and gives up.Jacob Rees-Mogg does not pack his own suitcases.Jacob Rees-Mogg has a private chapel. It contains some of his most prized possessions: a fragment of the true cross, a fragment of the crown of thorns and a piece of Thomas More’s hair shirt. It is illegal to buy and sell this sort of item, he says, but not necessarily illegal to buy and sell the containers that they happen to come in. What an unexpected wheeler dealer.Jacob Rees-Mogg is capable of emotion. But only briefly and only if you look hard enough. He doesn’t flinch when he loses his seat, nor does he flinch when the promise of becoming Conservative party chairman is snatched from him at the last minute. But when he Facetimes his daughter shortly after she has been sent to boarding school – something he struggled to adapt to as a child and she clearly isn’t thrilled about either – he very briefly clams up in a very repressed, English, privately educated way. Maybe, buried deep beneath the multiple self-parodic layers he’s constructed around himself, he does actually have a heart.Jacob Rees-Mogg makes his children dress in black tie for dinner on Saturday nights.

Your reputation may have enhanced your prospects but, when it came to job hunting, your qualifications and CV were pretty much the only showcase you had.With the internet everything changed – and then changed again with social media and smartphones. Suddenly, you were visible to millions of people on a device they carried around in their pockets.

The Guardian,From WAG to queen of the jungle: the rise and rise of Coleen Rooney,"Once in the shadow of her footballing husband, Coleen Rooney has forged a reputation absolutely her ownAt the height of her husband’s fame, Coleen Rooney appeared to be just another WAG: one of the “wives and girlfriends” who trailed around after their footballing partners at tournaments around the world.

The Guardian,"Saving ‘old and wise’ animals vital for species’ survival, say scientists","Hunting bigger, more experienced animals eradicates memories and knowledge crucial to group survival, research suggestsIt’s not just humans who get wiser as they age – animals do too, according to a growing body of research. The bigmouth buffalo fish can reach 127 years old, the Greenland shark 392, and some sponges can live for 10,000 years or more. And age is not just a number: as animals get older they behave differently depending on their life experiences, gain richer knowledge of their environment, and often pass it on to younger members of their group, researchers say.The problem is, we are killing off these older creatures. “Earth’s old animals are in decline,” researchers warned in a paper published in Science last month, which analysed more than 9,000 peer-reviewed papers. Few animals make it to old age, and the ones that do are vulnerable to being hunted or harvested by humans, because they are the biggest or have, for example, the largest antlers, horns or tusks.
