The Guardian,Brian and Maggie review – it’s a real worry when Margaret Thatcher seems this admirable,"You can tell how corrupt our recent politicians have been by how attractive Harriet Walter’s portrayal of the ex-PM seems alongside Steve Coogan in this drama based on a scorching TV interviewBrian and Maggie is a two-parter billed as a docuseries by its creators that traces the relationship between former Labour MP turned journalist Brian Walden (Steve Coogan) and Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher (Harriet Walter) and its abrupt ending, brought about by his uncustomarily scorching interview with her after chancellor Nigel Lawson’s shock resignation in 1989.Written by Sherwood’s James Graham, it is directed by Stephen Frears and boasts a cast full of notables fit to stand alongside Coogan and Walter. Yet it is an odd beast, perhaps because it is trying to do so much. It is partly an examination of the importance of the long-form political interview, for which Walden was famous, in a democratic society, and a lament for a bygone age when the argument for it could still be made. It is partly an examination of proximity to power and the cosiness that can develop between people who move in overlapping circles, the boundaries that can be crossed and what happens if you try to re-establish them. It’s about friendship, commonalities, betrayals of many kinds. It’s about 80s politics generally, Thatcherism specifically, the attraction felt for an ideologue and the ramifications when it wanes. It’s about class politics too, as Walden and Thatcher bond over their own-bootstraps upbringings and earned entry into the rarefied worlds of media and politics that their publicly schooled colleagues were effortlessly ushered into.Brian and Maggie is on Channel 4 now.

The Guardian,Idris Elba: Our Knife Crime Crisis review – vital viewing from Hackney’s A-list crusader,"Elba is at his magnetic best in this fantastic documentary: challenging racist myths, comforting victims’ families and packing in more nuance than you’d think possible. He’s like a supernatural forceThe director Guillermo del Toro once said Idris Elba has “a supernatural gravitational force” and compared him to a “Rodin sculpture … [with] all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes”. It is those qualities – being a magnetic TV and movie star and an activist seemingly carrying the burden of the world on his shoulders – that makes him so compelling in Idris Elba: Our Knife Crime Crisis.The BBC documentary follows Elba throughout 2024, as he mounts a campaign to try to stop knife crime in the UK. The headlines have long been filled with tragic stories of young lives ended by blades, but in the past decade the numbers have almost doubled, with four people in the UK dying from stab wounds every week. Elba first got involved in 2019, posting videos online about how more had to be done to stop it. Since then, he has become more informed and more involved. We watch him meet politicians, law enforcement officers, victims, prisoners, youth workers and trauma specialists to figure out a proactive – rather than reactive – approach, and carry out interventions in the lives of those who might one day become perpetrators.

The Guardian,‘Asura is the best Netflix drama in years’: this strikingly beautiful show will leave you salivating,"Palme d’Or-winning Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda’s tale of four sisters is a stunningly shot, laugh-out-loud tale that’s hugely touching. How has it gone almost unnoticed?Trust Netflix to make absolutely no fuss whatsoever about Asura, which could be the best drama it has put out in years. The lack of fanfare for the series, quietly released in early January, is genuinely baffling. It comes from the Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda, who previously made the gorgeous The Makanai: Cooking for the Maiko House for the streamer and was nominated for an Oscar for his majestic 2018 film Shoplifters, which also won the Palme d’Or. You would think those credentials might have earned this a bit of a push. Instead, we must rely on word of mouth, so here it is: this is a fantastic television series, and it would be criminal to let it pass you by.Asura is an adaptation of a novel by Kuniko Mukôda, which was turned into a popular Japanese TV series in 1979. In Kore-eda’s reimagining, the four Takezawa sisters represent a different vision and version of womanhood and femininity during this period. Takiko (Yû Aoi) is a civil servant, working in a library, who is as buttoned up as her youngest sister Sakiko (Suzu Hirose) – a waitress with a deadbeat boxer for a boyfriend – is flamboyant. They are frequently at each other’s throats in some of the show’s funniest scenes. Oldest sister Tsunako (Rie Miyazawa) is widowed with an adult son, and arranges flowers for a local restaurant, while Makiko (Machiko Ono) is a housewife, the mother of two teenage children, and the centre of these women’s firm bond.

The two-hour film, made over the course of six years, also documents prisoners’ longstanding efforts to improve conditions deemed “unconstitutional” by the US justice department in a 2020 report, under constant physical threat from prison management. Despite federal calls for prison reform, Alabama’s prisons currently operate at 200% capacity, the film notes, with only one-third of the required staff.

Not among the VIPs in that Oxfordshire hall but far outside, from a woman in Newcastle. I have told her story before: as the Brexit vote loomed, a London professor warned the geordie heathens that leaving Europe would harm the UK’s economy. Then one of the aforementioned heathens yelled back: “That’s your bloody GDP. Not ours.”
 Rude, crass? Absolutely. Yet she raised one of the big questions for the Westminster classes, which cuts to the very heart of politics. Jabbing a finger into a navy lapel, it demands: who are you actually helping? The answer sealed the fate of George Osborne and David Cameron, and it will prove as decisive for Reeves and Keir Starmer.No one can be unclear what this Labour government wants. “Growth, growth, growth,” clapped Reeves this week, as she strode into a meeting of Labour MPs. Even after the Christmas pantos, ministers are staging their own version of Peter Pan: they close their eyes – and believe!

I refer you to Selena Gomez’s now-deleted Instagram video on Monday in which the actor sniffled and wept about Trump’s immigration crackdown. The 32-year-old was instantly trolled by Trump-loving monsters, but there were plenty of sighs and tuts coming at her from Trump haters, too. Gomez had Done the Wrong Protest and would have to pay.The difficulty of course is that Trump’s “flood the zone” approach in his first week of office has made organising a response to him incredibly hard, not just collectively but at the individual level.

For damaging picture frames, obstructing the road, or just talking about obstructing the road, they have received punishments that we would normally reserve for serious crimes. People trying to draw attention to the government failure to confront the cause of the climate crisis were imprisoned for up to five years.These sentences have been condemned as draconian by Amnesty International, as “a grave erosion of … freedoms” by Liberty, as “a profound injustice” by Global Witness, and as “not acceptable in a democracy” by a special rapporteur for the UN. They represent the terrifying decline of our nation, from a beacon of tolerance with a clear division between politics and policing, towards an oppressive state where that dividing line is becoming harder and harder to discern.

Both elements were present when Rachel&nbsp;Reeves addressed an audience in Oxfordshire yesterdayon Wednesday, but there was a lot more policy than argument. The chancellor listed many actions to kickstart growth in the economy. There will be a lot of new infrastructure and new transport links – including expansion of Heathrow and other airports. The area between Oxford and Cambridge will be developed into Britain’s Silicon Valley. Ms Reeves pledged more international trade and more state subsidies for green technology.The list was long, the persuasion was cursory. The chancellor’s economic case is that weak productivity growth has been the malaise holding back Britain’s economy. The remedy is a supply-side assault on regulation. The government will ease rules that are deemed to have thwarted crucial developments in the past. It certainly can take too long and cost too much to build in Britain. The saga of HS2 – approved in 2012, started in 2017, not due for completion until 2033 and likely to cost nearly double the original £37.5bn estimate – is a parable of that dysfunction.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: a disaster with many makers,"Western resource-hunger has fuelled a vast humanitarian crisis. Donors must now press Rwanda to pull back from this warThere are bodies on the streets, hundreds of thousands of civilians fleeing and overwhelmed hospitals draining fuel from ambulances to keep respirators running. The rapidly escalating conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) – which has seen rocketing sexual violence, the execution of children and the displacement of 400,000 people this year alone – has just exploded with the M23 rebel&nbsp; group’s seizure of Goma, in the east.Their advance comes thanks to backing from Rwanda, despite the coyness of the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame. Mr Kagame suggests that M23 is defending the country’s Tutsis, victims of Rwanda’s 1994 genocide, against an armed group set up by former genocidal killers. But the threat those fighters pose appears greatly exaggerated: analysts believe the real aim is to seize mineral-rich territory. There is a striking parallel with Russia’s tactics in eastern Ukraine in 2014. On Wednesday, Rwandan troops were seen heading towards Bukavu, another key city, with the M23 fighters.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The west is complicit in the killing of children in Gaza | Letters,"Readers respond to articles by Nesrine Malik and Seema Jilani about the horrific loss of children’s lives in GazaThank you, Nesrine Malik, for saying so movingly what many of us have felt throughout the Israeli assault on Gaza (Goodbye to the lost children of Gaza. You were loved, you are remembered, you did not deserve it, 27 January). Most western media have been reluctant to call out the horror for what it is. One sentence in her excellent article stands out for me: the killing of children on such a scale was “unnecessary and only permitted because Palestinian life as a whole has been made cheap by the logic of Israel’s absolute right to defend itself by whatever criminal&nbsp;means it likes”.Western governments and media have been shamefully complicit in overlooking these atrocities, taking no significant action to restrain or condemn Israel, maintaining neutrality between those dropping the bombs and the babies underneath them. Even now, Palestinian suffering is underemphasised. The attention given to the fewer than 100 Israeli hostages still held in Gaza is grossly disproportionate to that given to the suffering of the Palestinians, including the more than 9,000 Palestinian detainees, many of them held without trial or charges.Michael FosterChelmsford Continue reading...","Wed, 29 Jan 2025 18:15:45 GMT",-0.6597,-0.9802
The Guardian,How we level the playing field for interns | Letters,"People from marginalised groups face significant barriers when seeking internships, writes Wendy Sloane You report on the Sutton Trust’s demand that all internships lasting four weeks or longer should be paid, to close the social mobility gap (Unpaid internships ‘locking out’ young working-class people from careers, 23 January). However, the article did not fully address the fact that many internships and work placements are, in essence, “nepo-adjacent” – they are largely secured through industry contacts rather than open competition.Many of my journalism students come from marginalised groups based on race, ethnicity and class. With limited industry connections, they can face significant barriers which result in restricted job opportunities and hinder their social mobility. In response, I’ve worked to level the playing field for them by founding the London Met Journalism Diversity Network. This initiative helps students gain access to opportunities, broadens their professional networks, and improves graduate outcomes. Continue reading...","Wed, 29 Jan 2025 18:15:33 GMT",0.2023,0.9337

The Guardian,Nwaneri’s screamer seals turnaround at Girona as Arsenal ensure spot in last 16,"What was it Mikel Arteta had said? “We’ve got some player there.” You certainly have. With four minutes left in Arsenal’s last Champions League match of a hugely impressive first phase, Ethan Nwaneri began his long, slow walk around the pitch at Montilivi. As he went, they waited for him with open arms on the away bench and, in the small main stand, supporters and staff stood and applauded. He was in no hurry; he had given everything and was happy to take it all in.Ultimately, this was a comfortable night for Arsenal, and it had always been likely to be. They had earned the right to play virtually risk-free and although Raheem Sterling missed a last-minute penalty, a 2-1 win over Girona completed the job of carrying them directly to the last 16 as expected. Arsenal are third, Arteta talking about having “the privilege of sitting at home” during the playoff round. In the absence of jeopardy or epic, what made it memorable was the 17-year-old who celebrated his first Champions League start with a superb performance and a wonderful winning goal.

I still don’t get it.” So he turned her down. And when Dexys laid down Come on Eileen with Langer behind the mixing desk, he didn’t think it would be a hit. “I was completely wrong. I never had the faith.”It duly reached No 1 and became the biggest-selling single of 1982, just one of the many triumphs Langer had with production partner Alan Winstanley.

The Guardian,Backlash builds: why the architecture world hates The Brutalist,"Brady Corbet’s Oscar-tipped film is clearly based on real-life modernist master Marcel Breuer but brazenly misrepresents him and his revered modernism• This article contains spoilers for The BrutalistIt has graced tea towels and cushions, mugs and socks, and spawned numerous Instagram accounts and coffee table books galore. Now brutalism, the once-maligned postwar architectural style of chiselled concrete forms, has finally reached Hollywood, in the form of an epic three-and-a-half-hour film that looks set to sweep the Oscars. You would think that architecture fans would be thrilled to have their subject in the limelight for a change. But they are raging.There is nothing more irritating to enthusiasts than when the mainstream tries to portray their niche world and gets it wrong. And The Brutalist gets an awful lot wrong. Just as Gladiator II recently vexed classicists with its inaccurate portrayal of the emperors and its anachronistic scenes of people reading the newspaper and drinking at cafes (neither of which, apparently, existed at the time), so too has director Brady Corbet riled the architecture world by playing fast and loose with his interpretation of brutalism, the Bauhaus, postwar immigration and the basic process of architecture itself.

The Guardian,Posh Girls review – boarding school besties on the couch,"King’s Head theatre, LondonThis satire stars co-writers Harriet Chomley and Sophie Robertson as estranged friends who meet in therapyMuscular writing is required to overcome the cliches of a two-hander set in therapy. Posh Girls may have swapped the analysts’ couch for a sofa in the waiting room, but actor-writer pair Harriet Chomley and Sophie Robertson don’t quite manage to wriggle out of the limitations of their show’s rather forced setup.Posh Girls pitches itself as a satire of upper-class girlhood, full of careless flouncing, rounded vowels and ridiculous nicknames. When Alex (Chomley) and Hermione (Robertson) run into each other at their very expensive therapist’s, Alex’s offhand comment that her daddy owns the building gives a sense of scale to their wealth. But this is no eat-the-rich ridicule. Instead, this story of a fractured friendship peels away the fronts these 30-year-olds have put on for each other, revealing the traumatic challenges they have faced and the hole each one’s absence has left in the other’s life.At the King’s Head theatre, London, until 2 February Continue reading...","Wed, 29 Jan 2025 20:00:15 GMT",0.0,-0.6684

That’s because window vacs don’t combat dust, but instead suck up water.These handy gadgets lift excess moisture off windows and collect it in their water tanks. This makes them particularly useful in places prone to condensation and to help combat damp problems, such as black mould and rotting woodwork.

I had a great time with my 13-year-old and her Ethiopian pal, who assured me of her skill in this department thanks to the traditionally spicy food her family eats at home.We tasted the sauces on their own and with food. Both are essential: with the first drop, you’re looking for the flavour profile and overall taste; with the second mouthful on food – in our case a margherita pizza – you’re looking for how the heat and flavour of the sauce cut through. The moment the heat from the chillies comes into contact with food, especially carbohydrates and fats, the potency is reduced and the heat is sucked up. If you want a sauce to season food and enhance its flavours, then you need more heat than is obvious, and definitely more heat than when tasting the sauces on their own.

I was entirely dependent on him, but he never once made it awkwardRead more in the kindness of strangers seriesI was cycling in rural Turkey – I couldn’t tell you where. My plan that day was to ride until I reached a village with somewhere I could stay. I needed people because, unlike other bike tourists, I didn’t have a tent. I thought not bringing one would mean I had more adventure – maybe I’d stay in barns, living rooms or school halls. That had worked in Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea. It didn’t work in Turkey.I needed to get to the next town before sunset. I was cycling quickly downhill, probably too fast for a gravel road.

The Guardian,A moment that changed me: I hated my job in advertising – then a mug of home-made stew set my life on a whole new path,"Signed off with depression, I began gardening. Being able to grow my own food brought me hope and a career changeIn 2012, I had taken to hiding and sobbing in a meeting room at the London advertising agency I worked for. I held a senior position at the company and, if I had been found, it would have been deeply embarrassing. But most days, I woke up feeling as if a lead weight was pressing on my chest; I would spend my commute overwhelmed by an inexplicable feeling of sorrow. Every ringing phone in the office felt like an electric shock. Hiding in the barely used meeting room, hoping for respite had become a regular occurrence.But respite didn’t come. Despite my picture-perfect life – high-flying career, happy home and good health – my mind unravelled. I was signed off work with depression and, initially, spent weeks curled beneath the duvet with the curtains drawn, unable to face life, and consumed by shame. The good fortune of understanding bosses and private health cover meant I had access to drugs, therapy, doctors – whatever I needed. But real healing, hope and even a whole new career eventually came from an unlikely place: a vegetable patch. Continue reading...","Wed, 29 Jan 2025 06:55:38 GMT",-0.6369,0.3825
The Guardian,"My winter campervan adventure in the Cairngorms, Scotland","A slow jaunt around the mountainous national park, on some of the highest roads in Britain, delivers dramatic scenery, frosty walks and ziplining after darkThe road north takes us through a landscape muted by frost, the hills hazy beneath the milky winter sun. My friend Anna and I are heading for the Cairngorms in a red campervan called Rowan, which we picked up from Big Sky Campers, just across the Forth from Edinburgh. It’s an appropriate name, for we see the red berries of rowan trees everywhere we go, shining so brightly it’s as though someone’s strung tiny clusters of baubles on the silver-barked branches.At 1,748 square miles, the Cairngorms is the UK’s largest national park, stretching from Perthshire in the south to Moray in the north; mountains rear up just after we pass the riverside village of Dunkeld, armed with pastries from Aran Bakery.

The Guardian,My partner reaches orgasm long before I do – then she loses all interest,"It’s been like this for most of  our 10 years together. I’m getting a little frustratedMy partner has little interest in foreplay and wants to move quickly to the main event. This nearly always consists of standard straight vanilla sex: penetrative, usually missionary. She reaches orgasm very rapidly – nearly always before I’m anywhere close – after which she immediately loses all interest. She does manually bring me to climax, but I don’t feel close to her at that moment. Then she gets on with her day, or goes to sleep.We have been together 10 years and this pattern dates back to early in our relationship. I am increasingly frustrated: while we have sex relatively often and the early stages are pleasurable, I almost never have a really good orgasm. This is having an effect on our relationship more generally. We have talked about it a lot (my partner would say too much), but she can’t seem to see the problem.
 Among both men and women, there are people who are challenged by the notions of taking time for pleasure or the bonding that can occur through physical closeness after sex. There can be many reasons. Some people are simply not wired for true intimacy. Some have such poor body image that they don’t want to risk being seen. Others have personality types that are not consistent with the ability to achieve a sufficient level of relaxation or allow for fun or sexual creativity. If your partner is very goal-oriented in general, then it is reasonable to imagine her sexual modus operandi would be similar. Perhaps she is anxious – a person with an anxiety disorder is fixated on the future and cannot simply be in the moment to luxuriate in sex; such a person will usually just want to finish and move on as your partner does. Some people even have phobias about touch, or a morbid fear of germs; such people will want to make a sexual session as brief and focused as possible, and will need a high level of control. It would be worth considering your partner’s sexual style in the context of the broader person. Doing so may give you clues as to how to approach her.

The Guardian,Animal spirits: Labour want to unleash them – but what do they actually mean?,"The term has Keynesian roots and was explored in a 2009 book. Problem is, it can mean very different things to different people ...‘We’re all sick of Britain being in the slow lane … we want to see a revival of those animal spirits so that we can grow the economy and bring investment here,” said Rachel Reeves on her return from Davos last week. Plainly a memo has gone round: in a radio interview this morning, business secretary Jonathan Reynolds claimed Labour’s willingness to take bold decisions “unleashes the animal spirit, the sense of something exciting happening”. When Reeves set out her plan for growth this afternoon, she reprised many of her Davos themes. She’s on a strange crusade against newts and bats, holding wildlife concerns responsible for Britain’s anti-growth mindset; she thinks bringing down net migration and fearlessly growing the economy are compatible and equal priorities; she’s putting a hell of a lot of faith in extra airport runways. But at least this time she wasn’t saying we should be more like Trump.But what does “animal spirits” mean? Does it mean what Reeves thinks it means? Is it a useful concept? And how do we get hold of some of these spirits? Continue reading...","Wed, 29 Jan 2025 16:05:19 GMT",0.0387,0.91

The Guardian,All in the mind? The surprising truth about brain rot,"Is screen use really sapping our ability to focus and lowering our IQs? The scientists who have actually analysed the data give their verdictAndrew Przybylski, a professor of human behaviour and technology at Oxford University, is a busy man. It’s only midday and already he has attended meetings on “Skype, Teams, in person and now FaceTime audio”. He appears to be switching seamlessly between these platforms, showing no signs of mental impairment. “The erosion of my brain is a function of time and small children,” he says. “I do not believe there’s a force in technology that is more deleterious than the beauty of life.”Przybylski should know: he studies technology’s effects on cognition and wellbeing. And yet a steady stream of books, podcasts, articles and studies would have you think that digital life is lobotomising us all to the extent that, in December, Oxford University Press announced that its word of the year was “brain rot” (technically two words, but we won’t quibble) – a metaphor for trivial or unchallenging online material and the effect of scrolling through it. All this has sown widespread fears that the online world that we – and our children – have little choice but to inhabit is altering the structures of our brains, sapping our ability to focus or remember things, and lowering our IQs. Which is a disaster because another thing that can significantly impair cognitive function is worry. Continue reading...","Wed, 29 Jan 2025 05:00:35 GMT",0.5267,-0.8388
