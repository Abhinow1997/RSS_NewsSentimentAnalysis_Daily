The Guardian,"Ukraine war briefing: more than 3,000 North Korean military casualties in Russia’s Kursk, claims Zelenskyy","Ukraine president criticises world leaders for doing ‘almost nothing’ to counteract Moscow’s military cooperation with Pyongyang. What we know on day 1,035Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded in Russia’s Kursk region. The Ukrainian president warned that Pyongyang could send more personnel and equipment for Moscow’s army and criticised world leaders for doing “almost nothing” to counteract Russia’s military cooperation with the North. “There are risks of North Korea sending additional troops and military equipment to the Russian army,” Zelenskyy said on Monday. South Korea’s military also said on Monday that it has detected signs of North Korea preparing to send more troops and weapons, including suicide drones, to Russia.Zelenskyy’s estimate of North Korean losses is considerably higher than that provided by Seoul’s top military officials, which said on Monday that at least 1,100 North Korean troops had been killed or wounded. That assessment was in line with a briefing last week by South Korea’s spy agency, which reported about 100 deaths with another 1,000 wounded in the region. According to Ukrainian and allied assessments, North Korea has sent about 12,000 troops to Russia.Zelenskyy accused Slovak prime minister Robert Fico of wanting to “help” President Vladimir Putin by continuing to import Russian gas. Zelensky said EU leaders had observed that Fico, who visited Moscow on Sunday, opposes reducing energy dependence on Russia, “implying that he wants to help Putin earn money to fund the war and weaken Europe”. “We believe that such assistance to Putin is immoral,” he added. Slovakia relies heavily on Russian gas and has raised concerns about the prospect of losing supplies after a contract for gas transit through Ukraine expires on 31 December.Russia said on Monday the situation with European countries that buy its gas through a transit deal via Ukraine was very complicated and needs more attention, a day after the talks between Putin and Fico. Ukraine has said it will not be renewing a five-year deal to pipe Russian gas to Europe, which is due to expire at the end of the year, as it does not want to aid Moscow’s military effort. The flow accounts for around half of Russia’s total pipeline gas exports to Europe, with Slovakia, Italy, Austria and Czech Republic set to be most affected if it ends. Fico said that Putin had confirmed Russia’s willingness to continue to supply gas to Slovakia, although this was “practically impossible” once the Ukraine transit deal expires.Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov has said that several countries had already offered to host talks between Putin and US president-elect Donald Trump, though he declined to say which. Trump has said he wants to swiftly end the war in Ukraine, though he has yet to set out publicly how he plans to do so. Putin said on Thursday that he was ready to compromise over Ukraine in possible talks with Trump and had no conditions for starting talks with the Ukrainian authorities.Ushakov said that he thought it likely that North Korean soldiers would take part in next year’s Red Square parade in Moscow to commemorate the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in the second world war.Keir Starmer and Zelenskyy have agreed on “the importance of refining” the UK’s training offer for Ukrainian armed forces to “further bolster Ukraine’s ability on the battlefield”. According to a readout of a call between the two leaders, Zelenskyy “reflected on the situation on the frontline in Ukraine and the need to ensure Ukraine could degrade Russian forces for the long haul”.Zelenskyy has said that Kyiv will support necessary allied efforts for stabilisation in Syria and had already made decisions to support its food security. “We believe it is crucial for the security of the Syrian people and the region as a whole to remove any Russian presence from Syria,”Italy’s cabinet passed a decree that allows it to continue supplying “means, materials and equipment” to Ukraine until the end of 2025 to support its war effort against Russia, a government statement said. Prime minister Giorgia Meloni has been a supporter of Kyiv since taking office in late 2022 and has vowed to back Ukraine until the war ends, amid uncertainty over the future attitude of the US once Trump takes office next month.

A council tenant all his life, he privately rented a small bungalow near Newton Abbot, where he could just about afford to live comfortably alone after the death of his partner.When his rent was raised sharply twice, however, it reached £1,100 a month – more than his entire state pension. He was left with £200 a month from his private pension to cover food, clothing and everything else.

Outside Ace cafe on the North Circular in north-west London, the car park is a lot busier and more colourful than usual. Hundreds of bikers have gathered, with most of those who have taken off their leather jacket in the sunshine revealing a garish Hawaiian shirt beneath. The atmosphere is convivial, celebratory and a little tearful: it’s nearly four months since the death of the TV presenter Dave Myers, one half of the Hairy Bikers. Today, on what has been christened “Dave Day”, a mass ride is planned to Myers’ home town of Barrow-in-Furness.The sheer size of the tribute is breathtaking. By the time he arrives in Cumbria, Si King, the other Hairy Biker and Myers’ best pal, will have ridden alongside tens of thousands of motorcyclists and been wished well by tens of thousands more pedestrians lining the route. Making plenty of stops for clips from the best of the Bikers’ two decades on the BBC, the gloriously emotional documentary The Hairy Bikers: You’ll Never Ride Alone – even the title is a tear-jerker – follows King on an extraordinary day. Without any disrespect to Britain’s other favourite TV presenters, and while hoping that it is many years before we find out, it is difficult to imagine such an outpouring for anyone else on the box. Would Ant or Dec shut down Newcastle city centre? Will the Narborough Road into Leicester be a gridlocked party zone when Gary Lineker goes? For Myers, they are out in droves. So many people. So many terrible shirts. Continue reading...","Mon, 23 Dec 2024 22:00:27 GMT",0.6747,0.9876

But could it get worse?The BBC’s three top earners this year will never be repeated. They are: Gary Lineker (who will step down from Match of the Day at the end of the 2024-25 season), Zoe Ball (resigned from Radio 2 breakfast show), Huw Edwards (convicted of accessing indecent images of children). It is a striking degree of churn for their biggest names.But four more of their highest-paid employees will also be absent next year: Mishal Husain (resigned to go to Bloomberg TV), Kirsty Wark and Martha Kearney (semi-retired) and Steve Wright (who died in February). There is also significant doubt about whether three of the likely recipients of the biggest pay cheques from BBC Studios (which, by claiming independent commercial status, does not have to make public pay disclosures) will be issued again: Jermaine Jenas had his contracts for Match of the Day and The One Show terminated in August after allegations of workplace misconduct. Gregg Wallace left In the Factory after similar concerns were raised, while he remains under investigation for issues arising at MasterChef, from which he has stepped away (with Grace Dent to replace him on the next series).

The Guardian,Forget ‘benefit cheats’ – £23bn a year is going unclaimed. How do we get that to vulnerable people? | Polly Toynbee,"The pension credit deadline has passed – and the government must help find millions missing out on money they’re entitled toAt the stroke of midnight on Saturday night, the shutters came down. Anyone who didn’t claim pension credit by then will have lost their winter fuel payment. Pension credit is designed to help low-income pensioners with living costs, and only those on this means-tested benefit qualify for winter fuel payments. Yet up to 880,000 older people entitled to pension credit don’t claim it. They’re only some of millions of people who aren’t getting their benefits. Last year, a total of £23bn in benefits and social support went unclaimed.There are far fewer pensioners living in poverty today than there were when the winter fuel allowance was introduced back in 1997, so means testing it by linking it to pension credit makes sense. Thanks to the pension triple lock, most pensioners will be better off by up to £472 a year from April 2025. Why give a winter fuel payment to Bernie Ecclestone, Rod Stewart, or to me? Until now, kind-hearted better-off pensioners donated their allowance to charity. Less kind people mocked the welfare state’s apparent extravagance.

The Guardian,From bacon baubles to glitter gravy: a guide to this year’s must(n’t) try Christmas trends | Rich Pelley,"Back away from the celeb endorsements and viral posts. As my gift to you, dear readers, I tried this stuff – so you don’t have toChristmas is all about traditions: repeating the same thing over and over, however silly it might be, because that’s just what you do at Christmas. But every time-honoured tradition has to start somewhere. In order to sell us tat we don’t need, and keep the PR industry ticking over, the holiday season has also become the time for all manner of daft fads, and celebs promising to give our favourite festive foods, games and pressies “a twist”. Not wanting to miss the (gravy) boat, I embarked on a spirited mission to try them all.This year’s hotly touted Christmas trends include “burr baskets” – a care package of cosy items such as blankets and socks given as a pre-Christmas gift, which sounds like an unnecessary extra faff. Then there’s a lot of talk about “Thriftmas”: re-gifting and buying secondhand gifts from charity shops, which my friend and I havebeen doing for years. The best/worst such gift, from me to him, was probably an unofficial version of Guess Who? with most of the pieces missing. And from him to me: a used chocolate Advent calendar, with all the chocolate scoffed. Also on trend in the world of gifts this year is burgundy wrapping paper, although I say: what’s wrong with tinfoil, like in Gavin and Stacey?

The Guardian,Assad’s demise has been widely celebrated – but it spells an uncertain future for Syria’s Kurds | Zeynep Kaya,"The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham regime, which has friendly relations with Turkey, is unlikely to tolerate Kurdish autonomyThe fall of Bashar al-Assad after the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) takeover in Syria is bad news for the country’s Kurds. It is worth charting how things got here from the start of the war in Syria in 2012. During the conflict, the Democratic Union party (PYD) emerged as the biggest and most influential Kurdish political actor in Syria, taking territorial control in the north and maintaining an autonomous administration, albeit a fragile one.The PYD’s position is even more precarious after the HTS takeover. Turkey, emerging as the most influential foreign actor in Syria, is laser-focused on limiting any Kurdish push for autonomy domestically and regionally. Another challenge the PYD faces is that the HTS-led regime is very unlikely to tolerate existing Kurdish autonomy in Syria.Dr Zeynep Kaya is a lecturer in international relations at the University of Sheffield.

The Guardian,Gen Z’s politics are hard to categorize – and a harbinger of a new political order | Ross Barkan,"The great clashes to come will be less between left and right than between those inside and outside a dying establishmentWe live, at first blush, under the absolute dominion of celebrity. The former and future president of the United States spent more than a decade as a reality TV star. Taylor Swift just concluded the largest and most lucrative pop music tour in the history of the world. Mass entertainment vehicles remain star-driven – just ask anyone flocking to see Wicked (Ariana Grande) or Gladiator II (Pedro Pascal, Denzel Washington) this holiday season. And that’s not to mention all the petty dramas of the attractive and famous that still keep us all gossiping.It might be strange, then, to make a completely counterintuitive claim: that we are leaving the age of traditional mass celebrity.

In this busy world, I hope my children can make similar memoriesIn our end of year series, writers and public figures remember the place or time when they felt most at homeMy childhood home was in South Africa. My parents adored each other and life for my two brothers and me was loving and carefree. Mum was a well-known actor and producer, and my father was a successful businessman. We had a big house in a three-acre garden, complete with huge old trees to climb, a scruffy lawn to play football on, a swimming pool and a tennis court. Today that whole white, privileged, almost colonial life under apartheid is embarrassing to admit to, but my memories are deeply happy.Christmas fell in midsummer, but we still ate turkey or roast beef, Yorkshire pud and Christmas pudding with brandy butter.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on homelessness: a health crisis as well as a housing one | Editorial,"The numbers trapped in temporary accommodation and sleeping rough have risen again. More homes for social rent are desperately neededShocking homelessness figures, showing that primary‑school children are the worst-affected age group in England, are a reminder of how gravely Conservative housing policies failed – and how desperately change is needed. In London, which has the highest homelessness rate, one in 24 pupils are in temporary accommodation – at least one in every classroom and more in poorer boroughs.Rough sleeping has also risen, bringing increased risks during cold winter nights. The recent increase in funding for councils, to help them fulfil their homelessness prevention duties, was welcomed by campaigners. But with charity budgets squeezed harder than ever, and with a national insurance rise for employers on the way, there is a real danger that housing problems for the most vulnerable members of society could get worse rather than better.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on the tenacity of hope: a necessary virtue in troubled times | Editorial,"At a moment of the year associated with renewal and new birth, reflection on inspiring acts of solidarity and courage can point the way to a better futureIn the introduction to a new, seasonal compilation of his speeches on hope, Pope Francis reflects on the legacy of the great German theologian Johann Baptist Metz. Shaped by the early experience of living through the horrors of the Nazi era, Metz’s political theology was a passionate warning against the danger of a self-absorbed Christian piety. Instead he urged a hopeful “mysticism with open eyes” – one that clear-sightedly bears witness to, and seeks to alleviate, the suffering of others.At a time of the year associated with renewal and new birth, it is not necessary to share Metz’s religious convictions to feel the power of that message. This year&nbsp;has been filled with heart-rending images from the&nbsp;ongoing wars in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and elsewhere. The weekend brought reports of yet more innocent casualties of Israel’s relentless bombing campaign, including children sheltering in a school.

The Guardian,Devolution will only work if Westminster can let go of power | Letters,"Roger Read, Tom Wilson, John Harris and Barrie Baldelli on Labour’s plans to reform local governmentMartin Kettle agrees with the government favouring “English counties, not regions, as an essential building block of a modern network” (We now have a plan to make England’s local government work – but I fear party politics will trash it, 19 December). There is a key word and concept that should form the basis of good governance. It is “subsidiarity”, meaning that decisions should be taken at the level to which they apply. It forms the basis for good governance across Europe, which is based on regions.This is because there are key functions and decisions that can only be taken effectively and in an integrated way across regions. They include the strategic planning of major developments, transportation systems, infrastructure networks, housing market areas, higher-end retail catchments, health provision and higher education, as well as environmental entities such as river valleys and water-catchment areas.

The Guardian,Everybody seems to be having an off-day when they play against Liverpool,"Liverpool keep doing Liverpool things. The Premier League is now theirs to lose, and for a manager in his first season in England, that is a remarkable achievementSign up to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson hereEventually, there comes a point at which the fact that everybody seems to be having an off-day when they play against Liverpool has to be taken as a Liverpool thing rather than a quirk of the calendar. They head into the Christmas programme four points clear of Chelsea at the top of the table with a game in hand having lost only one of 16 games. While this will always in part be the season when Manchester City imploded, it should also be pointed out that Liverpool at the moment are on course for 93 points; only four times has the champion ever won more than that.Even with Liverpool’s consistency there’s a tendency to look at Sunday’s 6-3 win at Tottenham as a result of the inexcusable openness of Tottenham rather than of their own excellence. And it is true that it’s easier to play Spurs right now, when they’re missing Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven, when Ange Postecoglou is doubling down even further on doing things his way, than it might have been at certain other points of the season. But at the same time, Spurs tend, relatively at least, to be better against teams who come at them, who give them space behind the defensive line they can attack, and until the game disintegrated into mass silliness in its final quarter, Liverpool gave them a lesson.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.

The Guardian,‘Perfect paternalistic nonsense’: why Father of the Bride is my feelgood movie,"The latest in our series of writers revealing their favourite mood-lifting films is an ode to the 1991 comedy in which Steve Martin is a farcically over-protective fatherI should hate this film. A possessive father loses the plot at the notion that his 22-year-old daughter – a sophisticated architecture student just back from a semester in Rome – is engaged to a man he hasn’t met. After she tells him the news at dinner, we see her saying it a second time through his eyes, as a seven-year-old. When the groom arrives, dad almost has an aneurysm at him daring to put his hand on her leg, and starts watching America’s Most Wanted every night looking for his face. He goes so cuckoo bananas over the prospect of their wedding that he loses it at the supermarket and briefly ends up in jail. “I was no longer the man in my little girl’s life,” he rues. It is paternalistic nonsense, and it is perfect.I first watched the 1991 remake of Father of the Bride (FOTB) as a kid because it is my dad’s favourite film. As his only daughter I categorically refuse to read into this, though I enjoyed telling my boyfriend when I made him endure my recent rewatch. (Roughly my 975th viewing; his first and, I suspect, only.) It’s the film that made me fall in love with Steve Martin, our paranoid FOTB George Banks, and Diane Keaton, optimistic MOTB Nina, whom I came to regard as my cinematic parents, a comfort whenever I see them on screen.

The Guardian,St Nicholas review – Conor McPherson’s vampire tale leaves you hungry for more,"Omnibus theatre, LondonNick Danan is captivating as a power-hungry, parasitic theatre critic drawn into a supernatural world This lesser revived monologue by Conor McPherson begins with male mid-life crisis but heads into a direction that is altogether more unfamiliar and alluring. A man sits before us, telling his story with the intimacy of a confession. He is a Dublin-based theatre critic, played by Nick Danan, jaded and power hungry, though not quite as flatly villainous as Ian McKellen’s drama reviewer in Patrick Marber’s The Critic. He speaks of his drinking, his distance from his family and his search for a story that will elevate him into the ranks of the artists he so envies.For a while, it seems as if this is little more than an acid-tipped screed against journalists. But McPherson’s monologue warms up when it enters into supernatural territory. The atmosphere is that of a ghost story but with a cast of enigmatic vampires who do not kill humans but feed off them nightly – rather like a theatre critic might be seen to do. The narrator is enlisted to bring back victims for them, and endowed with the charm to reel them in. Continue reading...","Mon, 23 Dec 2024 16:01:19 GMT",0.0,-0.726

 It’s rare for a dance piece to make you laugh; even rarer to find one set in a medieval re-enactment society meeting in a rundown community hall. But the glory of Crystal Pite and Jonathon Young’s new 2024 work, made for her company, Kidd Pivot, was its uniquely oddball worldview, which took the dynamics of a squabbling group and transformed them into a searing Arthurian legend full of love, loss and heroism.2.

Not so much in content – crushing poverty, a scary forest, a child-eating witch – as by venerable association since its world premiere on 23 December 1893. Long before it became a fixture of festive programming, the composer gifted early versions of the score to his fiancee for Christmas. Twice.We can only hope she was as delighted by it as the hordes of children brought to the Royal Opera’s latest “family-friendly” matinee revival of Antony McDonald’s 2018 production, sung in English translation.

The Guardian,Invitation to a Murder review – florist-detective leads crime yarn that out-cosies Agatha Christie,"Mischa Barton is the unexpectedly canny flower-bothering sleuth here in a not very mysterious costume thrillerServiceable but underwhelming, this murder mystery is very old-school in every way, reminiscent of many an Agatha Christie page-turner and even more so of Christie’s innumerable imitators. It’s like someone used AI to write the script, plugging in parameters such as “set it in the 1930s”, “plucky Englishwoman protagonist” and “ethnically diverse cast of supporting characters/suspects”.And so we have Mischa Barton playing Miranda Green, a florist by trade and naturally an avid reader of Christie; she gets a mysterious invitation and train tickets to visit the home of textile magnate Lord Findlay on an island. On the train, Miranda meets several other guests, all as bemused as she is at the invite: rangy and rude Yank Walker (Chris Browning), smooth Brit lawyer Lawrence Kane (Seamus Dever), Spanish waitress Carmen Blanco (Bianca A Santos), posh doctor Phillip Armstrong (Giles Matthey) and soignée Chinese visitor Lu Wang (Grace Lynn Kung). However, when they all arrive at the big creepy mansion, the servants regretfully inform them that their host has been delayed, so they pass the cocktail hour playing Two Truths and a Lie. Miranda, of course, turns out to be a crack player, so much so that you’d think the others would object more to the rudeness of her triumphant calling out of each lie. Later, bodies turn up, inspectors are called, secrets are revealed. Continue reading...","Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:00:14 GMT",-0.8481,0.5294
The Guardian,All of Us Strangers and 45 Years both won the Guardian’s film of the year. That’s not all that unites them,"Perfectly preserved corpses return to trouble – and liberate – the living in Andrew Haigh’s masterly dramasAll of Us Strangers may have missed out on awards earlier in the year (no Bafta wins, no Oscar nominations) but it has won the prize that matters: the Guardian’s best film of 2024. It is the second time that director Andrew Haigh has received this accolade – 45 Years, his searing study of a marriage plunged into crisis, was the Guardian’s choice as best film for 2015.On the face of it, the two films are sharply contrasting expressions of Haigh’s craft. 45 Years is resolutely realist in its portrait of a retired couple living in Norfolk, investing its middle-class milieu with an understated arthouse aesthetic. All of Us Strangers, meanwhile, returns to the gay themes that marked Haigh’s breakthrough Weekend, but in a shift from his past work operates in an unstable, dreamlike atmosphere that ultimately calls into question whether anything we are watching is supposed to be real.

The Guardian,The Christmas that went wrong: A piglet set our presents on fire,"On the family farm, homebrew and live animals turned a candlelit celebration into an infernoMy brother and I grew up on a self-sufficient farm in Cornwall in the 1970s. Behind our cottage, the yard was busy with pigs, which came in from the fields in the evening to sleep in the pigsty. Ducks sailed the duckpond, geese ruled the homefield and we hand-milked our cows in the byre. We loved our animals. Sick hens or piglets were brought in to convalesce next to the Aga in our kitchen, scattered corn sometimes germinating between the flagstones.Each Christmas, our tree stood in a bucket wrapped in red crepe paper, a pool of straw lying around its base, with our presents on top. We would decorate the tree with the glass baubles and 1930s celluloid toys that our grandmother bought during her boho life in pre‑war Berlin. So pretty. As darkness fell on Christmas Day, we&nbsp;would light real candles on the tree and bask in the&nbsp;magic. Continue reading...","Mon, 23 Dec 2024 15:00:18 GMT",-0.6705,0.215

Two days before our arrival, I was informed that the flat was no longer available and was offered an alternative. This turned out to be in a disgusting state. There were soiled and bloody sheets, rubbish and dirt everywhere, even a large knife inside the bathtub. There were also fewer beds than advertised.

We were subsequently told we could use the property next door but when we returned at 1am we found the access code we had been given didn’t work.

The Guardian,Rachel Roddy’s recipe for a sociable fish stew | A kitchen in Rome,"Livornese cacciucco mingles cultures and seafood for a richly flavoured soup that’s just made for sharingAccording to the cultural association Livorno Euro Mediterranea, the name of the city’s sociable soup-stew, cacciucco, is borrowed from the Turkish word küçük (small). The reason for this, according to the more plausible origin myths and etymology accepted by linguistic science, is the introduction to a Livornese tavern (possibly by a Turkish sea merchant) of a Turkish fish soup called balık çorbası. The resourceful and quickly adopted recipe called for küçük balık (small fish), and küçük was borrowed and became cacciucco.However the soup came into being, a recipe made from an amalgam of fish had the most favourable environment in a thriving Tuscan seaport with its amalgam of communities, as well as in the arrival of tomatoes in everyday cooking, in the late 1700s. The evolving cacciucco reflected all of this, so no wonder it became a symbol of the city. At this point, I must also mention cacciucco from the town of Viareggio, 50km north of Livorno, which is also as loved and as varied as the cooks who make it. Cacciucco in all forms illustrates beautifully the food historian Massimo Montanari’s theory that (often) the key word in the evolution of recipes is “encounter”: “The more numerous and interesting the encounters, the richer the result.”The Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

The Guardian,‘Each step we take is an escape’: the intrepid hikers exploring war-torn Yemen,"Few Yemenis hike, and female hikers are even rarer. But one group is overcoming security and social challenges to enjoy the benefits of walking in natureOn a warm spring afternoon in Haz, 40km north-east of Sana’a, Yemen’s capital, a curious child asks Fatima al-Aghbari if her bag carries treasure.

This year, a bloody war between rival factions of Mexico’s notorious drug mafia has cast a shadow over the holiday, leaving Culiacán’s Christmas fair nearly empty, and the city silent at night.Sinaloa has always had a complex relationship with its narcos, who portray themselves as generous bandits with a code of conduct.

The Guardian,The big picture: another Christmas rolls around…,"The most wonderful time of the year couldn’t be more manufactured in Al Barry’s amusing shot of Santa heads on a conveyer belt in 1955One solution to the vexed question of how old Saint Nick could fill every child’s Christmas stocking on a single night was provided by the Ideal Toy Corporation in 1955. In this picture by Getty photographer Al Barry, Santa was revealed as mass produced, ubiquitous. The image of the conveyor belt of Santa heads minus suits and boots and sacks might have invited the usual pearl-clutching about the commercialisation of Christmas – but which 1950s child would have wanted it any other way?Barry’s picture is included in a new collection of photographic festive nostalgia, A Very Vintage Christmas, which goes behind the scenes of winter wonderlands in the years between 1900 and 1980. As well as plastic Santa heads the collection includes images of the gigantic Macy’s Day parade Santa, of a battalion of chocolate Santas and of the famous Santa impersonator Lucky Squire, trimming his beard. Other traditions also excite economies of scale: there are production lines of novelty cracker twisters and cottage industries of bauble spanglers; warehouses of panettone processors, and Norfolk stately homes stuffed with turkeys. The joy of kitsch is set against the rawer emotions of the war years – sacks of mail stretching to the wintry horizon packed not with letters for Santa, but with missives to loved ones serving overseas – when Christmases “like the ones we used to know” were invested with collective hopes and dreams.

The Guardian,On a wing and a prayer: the hidden beauty of insect’s flight – in pictures,"For the past decade, the Barcelona-based visual artist Xavi Bou has devoted his work to revealing “the hidden beauty of natural movement”. His initial focus was birds; now he’s moved on to insects. In collaboration with US entomologist Adrian Smith he’s created an eye-popping series that captures – by merging multiple frames into a single image – the rhythmic flutterings of butterflies and chaotic leaps of spittlebugs and treehoppers. As well as their beauty, Bou was struck by the crucial role that insects play in ecosystems, even as their numbers plummet – it’s estimated that the biomass of flying insect species has decreased by 75% over the past 27 years. “We need to move beyond seeing insects as mere nuisances,” says Bou. “They are fascinating, essential creatures, and we owe them a great deal.” See more of Xavi Bou’s images here Continue reading...","Sat, 21 Dec 2024 17:00:22 GMT",0.5859,0.967
