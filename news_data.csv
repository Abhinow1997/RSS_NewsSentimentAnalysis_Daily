A shock of straw-coloured hair made him stand out in every opposing team’s penalty area even when he wasn’t spontaneously arranging his limbs to execute a spectacular aerial volley.

If you’re familiar with the ritual of half-watching a series or film – Netflix on in the background while you check out what your arch enemy has just posted on Instagram, say – it may surprise you to hear that Netflix doesn’t just know you engage in this obscene behaviour. It actually wants you to carry on.The streamer was in the news recently thanks to an excellent piece by Will Tavlin in n+1, which reminded readers of the platform’s microgenre of “casual viewing”: TV shows and movies designed to be watched while doing something else. One paragraph in particular incited a great deal of frustration. Tavlin claimed that Netflix have told various screenwriters to have their protagonists “announce what they’re doing so that viewers who have this program on in the background can follow along”.

The Guardian,Dame Joan Plowright obituary,"Stage and screen star who was part of a radical generation of actors responsible for establishing the National TheatreJoan Plowright, who has died aged 95, played a central role in the historic overhaul of British theatre at the Royal Court in the late 1950s. A founder member of George Devine’s English Stage Company in 1956, she made her name as Beatie Bryant, the working-class heroine in Arnold Wesker’s Roots in 1959, and married Laurence Olivier in 1961. The union of Plowright and Olivier was symbolic of the new theatre order embracing the old glamour, as the greatest actor of the day threw in his lot with the younger generation.Olivier had scored one of his biggest successes as Archie Rice, the dying music hall star, in John Osborne’s The Entertainer at the Court in 1957. When the play transferred to the West End and Broadway, Plowright took over from Dorothy Tutin as Jean Rice, Archie’s daughter, and their friendship ripened into an unshakeable intimacy, and marriage, that lasted until Olivier’s death in 1989.

This shift has meant more of us are surfing all year round, even in the chilliest of British winters.But such innovation has come at a cost, as explained in The Big Sea, a documentary made by two surfers from the north-east of England.

The Guardian,Scotland’s finest: Denis Law never forgot his country and it always revered him,"Aberdeen missed out on the striker on their doorstep who Sir Alex Ferguson regards as Scotland’s greatest ever player15 April 1967 is a date implanted in the mind of any Scotland supporter who wants to declare their team unofficial world champions. The 3-2 victory over Alf Ramsey’s all-conquering England at Wembley is about as good as it has ever got. Denis Law had already missed a sitter from Willie Wallace’s cross by the time he put the visitors in front. Jim Baxter roamed from midfield, Wallace fired towards goal and, following brief ping-pong inside the England penalty area, Law slammed home. Scotland had fretted that Law might not be fit to play in the Home Championship match; he was to be part of a team celebrated over decades.It is the same fixture at Hampden Park in 1966, though, that better epitomises Law. The forward is already mid-air to meet Willie Johnston’s corner by the time Bobby Moore sees fit to move. George Cohen and Gordon Banks are statuesque on the England goalline as the ball flies past them via Law’s head to afford Scotland a way back into a game where they already trailed by two. Law’s speed of thought was what set him apart. Journalists of the time noticed Law was rarely comfortable speaking about his method of scoring goals; instinct and a sublime talent were his key attributes. The best footballers often find it tricky to articulate how they do things. Continue reading...","Fri, 17 Jan 2025 21:00:06 GMT",0.5106,0.9412

The Guardian,Relief at this Gaza deal should be tempered by rage at Hamas and Netanyahu. How dare they take so long? | Jonathan Freedland,"The agreement reached this week is basically the plan Joe Biden unveiled in May. So much pain and death could have been avoidedWhen news of the ceasefire and hostage-release deal between Israel and Hamas first broke on Wednesday, a friend offered the kind hope that now, at last, there could be a sense of joy. I wanted very much to feel that way but, at that moment, I could not – and here’s why.For one thing, a mere announcement did not seem enough. When it comes to the Middle East, “believe it when you see it” tends to be a good operating principle. Sure enough, there followed 48 hours of hitches and last-minute delays and even now, as I write this and after the Israeli security cabinet approved the deal, it seems like tempting fate to assume everything will run smoothly.

The Guardian,"You’re really spoiling us: Trump miscasts Gibson, Stallone and Voight by making them mere ambassadors","The president-elect’s latest trio of mischievous appointments show his genius for trolling the celebrity-woke communityDonald Trump has permitted himself the delicious pleasure of trolling Hollywood’s celebrity-woke community who once dreamed of preventing his second term with their collective prestige. He has found a new wellspring of liberal tears in which to bathe. But whatever our feelings about his proposed “Hollywood ambassadors”, Mel Gibson, Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone – ambassadors to Hollywood from Maga? to Maga from Hollywood? – it’s possible to wonder if the ambassadors themselves have a right to be a bit miffed.Hollywood ambassador? Gibson has directed a number of feature films, (Stallone and Voight also have directing credits); these are vast organisational challenges, requiring energy, vision, skill and political finesse. And that zero-experience lunkhead Pete Hegseth gets to be defence secretary? Despite only knowing how to do sycophantic interviews with the once-and-future C-in-C on Fox News? What an insult to Gibson, Voight and Stallone who surely deserve cabinet posts. Arnold Schwarzenegger is perhaps constitutionally out of the running to be a Hollywood ambassador despite his own political experience, maybe because of his Austrian birth or his bold questioning of rightwing views.

The Guardian,The government wants to future-proof the BBC. How about embracing a subscription model? | Simon Jenkins,"Lisa Nandy needs creative ideas for the broadcaster. A hybrid funding settlement could protect its Reithian traditionThe BBC is still in the premier league of great British institutions – just. Other countries have public broadcasters, but none has the BBC’s range and authority. For generations, the corporation has served as a beacon of quality entertainment and journalism. Its World Service is a global shrine to the English language, with an astonishing 320 million worshippers. The BBC’s viewers pay a licence fee of just over £3 a week per household, which covers national TV channels, radio, iPlayer, a variety of apps and the World Service. That seems remarkably good value.Yet the problem is obvious. What was designed as the monopoly supplier of British broadcasting is now overwhelmed by a tidal wave of competition. The BBC boasts eight television channels; on my last count Sky had about 50. What with streaming, repeats, catch-ups and podcasts, Britain’s computer-literate younger generation sees nothing special in the BBC: in 2019, YouTube overtook the BBC among under-16s. Yes, the BBC delivers Gavin &amp; Stacey, Call the Midwife and Wolf Hall, but so could someone else and simply charge for them. And while documentaries of David Attenborough’s class remain outstanding, BBC One and Two are otherwise desperate for clicks, and seem padded out with hours of low-cost quizshows, antiques sales and celebrity wanderers.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Fri, 17 Jan 2025 14:31:51 GMT",0.0,0.9382

People all around me in Gaza – on buses, on donkey carts, in cars, on the street and in the markets – are describing it as a “war after the war”.The ceasefire is not the end of suffering. It is the beginning of everything else. It is an opportunity for people in northern Gaza, Rafah and elsewhere to mourn their loved ones who were killed and their destroyed homes. It is an opportunity to cry for those who have held back their tears for more than 15 months. We were told we could return to our homes, but those homes now lie in rubble.

The Guardian,My brother and father drowned on a bright summer day. Swimming brings me closer to the two men I’ve lost | Indigo Perry,"When my grief was new and raw, I discovered that feeling it was preferable to the numbness that had set in since we’d buried themLast week, I swam in the sea, slowly wading in until the water reached my hips, and then diving under the softly rippling waves. Clear jellyfish gleamed from the sand. Turning over to float on my back, I let my limbs and hair drift around me, and I thought about the spectral presence-absence of my father and brother, who drowned on a very hot summer’s day more than 30 years ago.My memories of the time when they drowned veer up in summer, especially on certain hot days ending with thunderstorms. Anyone who’s spent a summer in Victoria knows the kind of day that marks the end of a heatwave. It starts off hot, everyone kicking off their bedcovers before it’s time to get up. The temperature hasn’t dropped below 30C all night and possibly all week. The sky is a hard blue at midday, and it seems nothing will break the heat, despite the weather bureau’s promises. Then the wind picks up. By late afternoon, the sky darkens as though night has come early. Wind whooshes through trees, fire sirens wail, and the thunder starts rolling. Soon the rain sets in, and we open our windows to let in the cool air as the temperature drops. Continue reading...","Fri, 17 Jan 2025 14:00:38 GMT",-0.5106,-0.7024

Each generation has rediscovered and loved his work, much to the gratification (or sometimes dismay) of their baby-boomer parents and grandparents.The cycle will be perpetuated by A Complete Unknown, James Mangold’s acclaimed cinematic retelling of the early chapters in the singer’s career – the transition from penniless minstrel to counter-cultural icon by way of the New York folk scene of the early 1960s. As is normal for biopics, the movie takes liberties with the historical record, but the thrust of the narrative is not disputed. And while the music itself might be timeless, the analogue mechanism that conveyed Dylan to stardom looks very dated.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We asked those with seriously stylish homes for their brands of choiceThe bedding buying guide: everything you need to knowWatch any of those TV shows behind the scenes at posh hotels and the bedrooms will have one thing in common: crisp white sheets, immaculately styled. In our own homes, the reality may depend more on whichever bedding happens to be clean that day. The sheets might have been crisp and brilliant white at one point, but now have seen better days. Sound familiar? It could be time for an upgrade. Be smart about what you buy and look after it well and it should last you well into the next decade.While for some, five-star-worthy white cotton is the only way to go, others prefer to add a little detail: a subtle stripe, say, or some pretty embroidery in a contrasting colour. Perhaps you want artfully relaxed linen in an Instagram-friendly hue. Continue reading...","Thu, 16 Jan 2025 12:00:12 GMT",0.7579,0.9776

She talks about ripping up the rulebook, her new Jane Austen drama – and what she loves about Jeremy ClarksonKeeley Hawes is reminiscing about hanging out with Harrison Ford at the Emmys. “I said hello, as you do, and we ended up having a little chat. He was just lovely. I said: ‘I’m a big fan of your beautiful wife [Ally McBeal star Calista Flockhart] as well.’ His face lit up at the mention of her. She was nearby and he looked at her lovingly, then turned back to me and said: ‘What a wife. What a life.’ I&nbsp;just melted.”Hawes attended the Hollywood bash with her husband Matthew Macfadyen, who took home the outstanding supporting actor gong for his mighty turn as Tom Wambsgans in Succession. “Going with Matthew was the way to experience it,” she says. “If you’re ever lucky enough to be nominated for an award yourself, you get so nervous that it’s not very enjoyable. Here, I could get dressed up in a big frock, people-watch and have a fantastic time without any of the worry. It was a whirlwind of glitter and fabulousness … and Matthew won. What’s not to love?

The Guardian,‘The high point of TV as a medium’: David Lynch’s Twin Peaks may never be bettered,"The surreal murder mystery’s impact is so profound that its fingerprints are on every show made during TV’s golden age. What a legacy In the coming days and weeks, much will be made about David Lynch’s gargantuan contribution to cinema. This will be undeniable and well deserved. However, there is the argument to be made that David Lynch was able to master every medium in which he chose to work. His music, for instance, sounded like music that only he could make. And, sincerely, in both his daily weather report and his Today’s Number Is lottery draw, he deserves to be remembered as a pioneering YouTuber.However, in terms of pure influence, it might end up being the case that Lynch’s most important realm was television. In his lifetime, Lynch only ever worked on four TV projects. Two of them were cancelled after just three episodes. But the other two were Twin Peaks. And the impact both Twin Peaks series had on TV as a medium is hard to overstate. Continue reading...","Fri, 17 Jan 2025 08:00:27 GMT",0.0,-0.2532

The Guardian,The Guide #173: In praise of The Brutalist’s bladder-friendly intermission,"In this week’s newsletter: Brady Corbet’s three-hour epic has a helpful 15-minute break – with Hollywood’s ever-escalating runtimes, shouldn’t this be the norm?There’s a lot to like about The Brutalist, Brady Corbet’s newly minted Oscar best picture frontrunner. The tale of a Hungarian architect’s early years in postwar America and tortured quest to build a vast modernist community centre, it’s the sort of grand, decades-spanning epic that we complain Hollywood doesn’t make any more. It is full of chewy ideas around art, patronage, assimilation and America’s complex cultural relationship with Europe.Despite a (by modern standards) tight $10m budget, it looks astonishing (one scene filmed in a cavernous Italian marble quarry will set your eyes on stalks). The performances – Brody as its lead, Guy Pearce as his controlling, blue-blooded benefactor and Felicity Jones as his steely, principled wife – are layered and striking, as is its relentless score, by former Cajun Dance Party and Yuck guitarist Daniel Blumberg. But along with those qualities, one of my favourite things about The Brutalist might sound like an insult. I really enjoyed the bit when it wasn’t showing: its interval.

The Guardian,Is there such a thing as a good alcohol-free wine?,"These days, there are some exceptional examples to give a whirlFor those forgoing the virtuous annual kickstarter that is Dry January, disregard this article until, like me, you decide some time around February that it would probably have been a good idea. And for those currently knee-deep in it, let me shed some light on whatever the hell you’ve been drinking.I’m getting more and more requests to recommend “good” non-alcoholic wine, the inference being that much of the stuff is, well, not good. I can see where they’re coming from. When the word harmonious is used to describe a wine, it means it has just the right amount of all its constituent parts – think of it as something completely spherical, with no rough edges or sharp angles jutting out. At the Wine and Spirit Education Trust (WSET), we drinks pros learn that this is a balance between the likes of alcohol, tannin, acidity, alcohol, flavour and sweetness. So, when you take out the alcohol, which brings body and that ever-so pleasing burn, you can be left with a drink that feels oversweet, with tannin and acidity, but no alcohol to give it that mouth-filling oomph.

Has there been a power cut?’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants","I will never forget the vegetarian aubergine schnitzel option – it had the texture of a bloated sanitary towelToum, a modern Lebanese rotisserie with French culinary influences and chic cocktail-bar vibes, has recently appeared just off Regent Street, near Hamleys toy store. I often use Hamleys as a landmark for non-Londoners, because they might not find directions such as “It’s on Maddox Street, close to the Kingly Street food drag” all that useful, but may very well have experienced, or at least heard of, Hamleys’ daily “Friends Parade” with Professor Bubbles. If so, Toum is all of five minutes’ walk away, and serves cold tomatillo martinis and, more importantly, posh rotisserie chicken from a grill behind the chefs’ heads that’s in full view as you approach the front door. So very inviting.Or at least it is on social media. Toum is the pared-back sibling of Aline up the road, it’s open seven days a week and has a beautiful vinyl listening bar called Encore in the basement. While Aline offers a lengthy celebration of traditional Lebanese comfort food – two dozen meze, and sea bass and lamb chops from the grill – Toum keeps things simple, especially at lunchtime, when it’s even simpler still. There’s that humble roast chicken – described by breathless bloggers as “impossibly juicy” – served with toum (garlic sauce), although chimichurri and Café de Paris butter are on offer, too. There’s also a steak option and a vegetarian aubergine schnitzel, as well as a light waft of meze – well, hummus, pickles and that’s about it. Then again, in surroundings as elegant as these, with staff dressed so nicely and that rotating grill filled with succulent, Lebanese-spiced chicken by the front door, who would need anything more?
