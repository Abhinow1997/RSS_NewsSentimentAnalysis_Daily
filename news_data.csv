The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Kyiv’s troops regain village near Pokrovsk where ISW says Russians falter,"Moscow claims recapture of some Russian territory held by Ukrainian troops in Kursk; ‘security guarantees’ hole in US-Ukraine mineral deal. What we know on day 1,100Ukrainian troops on Wednesday announced a successful counterattack to retake the settlement of Kotlyne near the key city of Pokrovsk, which many Russian forces have died trying to take over the past year. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said: “The year-long Russian effort to seize Pokrovsk has so far failed, and Russian forces appear to have abandoned the effort to take the city directly, preferring instead to conduct a wide envelopment. The Kremlin may have abandoned even that effort for now, however, in the fact of increasing Ukrainian resistance in the area and extremely high Russian losses.”The Russian defence ministry said its forces had recaptured the settlements of Pogrebki and Orlovka, north of the town of Sudzha, in Kursk oblast where Ukraine has held territory inside Russia since August 2024. The ministry added that Russian forces had struck Ukrainian units and positions near more than a dozen settlements, including several around Sudzha. Zelenskyy, in his nightly video address, noted it was nearly seven months that Ukrainian forces “have been holding the buffer zone on the aggressor’s territory in Russia. They have almost become used to it.”The Ukrainian military said it had attacked Russia’s Tuapse oil refinery on the Black Sea coast and that at least 40 explosions had been recorded at the site. Tuapse is home to one of Russia’s biggest oil refineries and has been targeted by Ukrainian drones several times before. The Ukrainian military also said it had attacked two military airfields in Russia-controlled Crimea but gave no further details. Russia confirmed drones attacked its southern Krasnodar region, including the port of Tuapse, on Wednesday. Drones also attacked the Russian regions of Bryansk and Kursk, which border Ukraine, according to Russia’s defence ministry.Ukraine said Russian strikes on Kostyantynivka city in the east killed at least five people and wounded eight more. Russian drones also killed two people near Kyiv, including the Ukrainian journalist Tetiana Kulyk who worked for the Ukrinform news agency. Ukraine’s interior ministry said separately that two people were wounded in Kharkiv city during a drone attack. Ukraine’s largest private energy company, DTEK, said one of its facilities had been damaged in the Dnipropetrovsk region.Any peace deal for Ukraine must include “security guarantees” involving the “Atlantic alliance”, according to Giorgia Meloni, who was referencing Nato. The Italian prime minister spoke as it emerged a draft deal between the US and Ukraine does not include security guarantees, but only references Ukraine somehow obtaining them. Peace in Ukraine “can only be achieved if Kyiv is given adequate security guarantees to make sure that what we have seen over the past three years does not happen again”, Meloni said on Tuesday.While Donald Trump said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, would sign their “very big agreement” in Washington on Friday, Zelenskyy insisted that “guarantees of peace and security” remained vital as he prepared for “talks” with Trump. “For me and for all of us in the world, it’s important that US support is not stopped. Strength is needed on the path to peace,” Zelenskyy said during his evening address to Ukrainians on Wednesday. Zelenskyy elsewhere suggested the deal provides a “framework” under which security guarantees would be agreed jointly with the US and Europe. On security guarantees, Trump said “we’re going to have Europe do that” and Ukraine should forget about joining Nato.Zelenskyy is expected to visit Britain this weekend for talks with its prime minister, Keir Starmer, and other European leaders. Zelenskyy said on Wednesday that after his proposed trip to Washington on Friday, “I plan to go to London: and immediately after this I and the Europeans will meet there with Keir Starmer”. Keir Starmer will convene the meeting after he returns from also meeting with Trump in Washington.The Romanian parliament has authorised its army and allies to shoot down drones illegally breaching Romanian airspace. The EU and Nato member has had Russian drone fragments repeatedly fall on to its territory as Moscow has attacked Kyiv’s ports. Continue reading...","Thu, 27 Feb 2025 01:43:03 GMT",-0.5994,-0.9468

Then you spot spring’s first flower ...There’s no such thing as gardener’s block, I once read. This from, I believe, a famous writer who was making the point that if you’ve got writer’s block, you should just go and do something else for a bit. Point taken. There is no such thing as gardener’s block because if you get stuck doing one job, even in the smallest garden, there are roughly 10m other jobs you can be cracking on with. Which is quite right. And this is what makes gardening either the worst thing for you if – like me&nbsp;– you have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or possibly the best.I stride into the garden full of purpose and ambition, with a smile on my face. Invariably, several hours later, I stagger out of there, aching all over, scratched, bloodied, filthy and demoralised, having dug, scraped, cursed and carried myself to physical and mental exhaustion. The clarity of purpose I have at the outset vanishes very quickly, along with my secateurs. In its place, as things that need doing proliferate around me like Japanese knotweed, there comes a confusion of purpose. Lots gets done a&nbsp;little bit, but nothing gets done properly.

The Guardian,"The Last Laugh review – Eric Morecambe, Tommy Cooper and Bob Monkhouse’s antic triple act","Theatre Royal BrightonBob Golding, Simon Cartwright and Damian Williams, who have played the comedy giants before, summon them like spirits to the stage in this tribute‘You tell ’em a joke they’ve heard before, and: silence.” So says Eric Morecambe in The Last Laugh on audience resistance to secondhand comedy. But it’s a sentiment contradicted by the show itself, which recycles lots of jokes we’ve heard before in its tribute to three 20th-century comedy giants, and makes us laugh plenty. Writer-director Paul Hendy’s play imagines Morecambe, Tommy Cooper and Bob Monkhouse sharing a dressing room preshow. There is no plot, there are no narrative surprises, just chat and banter among the threesome about their lives and the nature of comedy. Oh, and jokes. Lots of – usually terrific – jokes.It’s as much tribute act as drama, the chief pleasure of which is to see these stars of (some of) our childhoods brought uncannily back to life. It helps that Bob Golding, Simon Cartwright and Damian Williams have played their alter egos before, extensively, and summon them like spirits to the stage. Jus’ like Cooper, Williams need only gather his awkward bulk and peer haughtily down from under his fez, and we’re laughing. Cartwright’s Monkhouse, bordering on animatronic and caked in makeup that would make Donald Trump blush (not that we’d see it), is fascinated by Tommy and Eric’s “funny bones”.

The Guardian,Tornado review – windswept samurai western set in apocalyptic Scotland,"The second feature from John Maclean is an almost surreal tale of itinerant martial arts performers and a band of thieves in 18th-century Scotland John Maclean’s new movie is a dour, pessimistic, almost surrealistically downbeat revenge western set in Scotland in the late 18th century – but it could as well be happening in some post-apocalyptic landscape of the distant future or on another planet. This is the follow-up to his debut Slow West, and as with that film it is shot by Robbie Ryan with music by Jed Kurzel (director Justin’s brother and collaborator). I have to admit, though, that this does not quite have the energy or the fluency of that previous film, perhaps not the same production resources either – and by comparison it is more strenuously contrived. Yet the pure strangeness of the movie commands attention and there is a charismatic lead performance by Japanese actor-musician Mitsuki Kimura, or Kôki.She plays a dancer called Tornado, who travels around what looks like utterly empty terrain with her impresario father Fujin (Takehiro Hira) in a covered wagon, putting on a samurai show. They perform with puppets, whose little lopped-off heads and limbs squirt out fake blood with tiny ingenious pumps; they also demonstrate samurai sword-twirling combat themselves. They appear to have once been part of a travelling circus encamped elsewhere. And who do they perform to? A crowd of people show up out of nowhere, having presumably walked many miles from the (unseen) villages where they live. Continue reading...","Wed, 26 Feb 2025 19:30:15 GMT",-0.6597,-0.2987

The Guardian,Dirtier BP is still miles away from resetting its share price,"Fossil fuel giant’s strategic U-turn may be far-reaching but even after ditching climate goals the shares fellBP to ramp up oil and gas output in major shift away from green goalsExplainer: why has BP pulled the plug on its green ambitions?BP’s new strategy is “exciting”, said chief executive Murray Auchincloss at one point during Wednesday’s long City presentation. Did the stock market agree? Hardly. Even after he ditched the climate goals, and vowed to pray solely at the altar of shareholder value, the shares fell by 1.4% on a day when the FTSE 100 index was up. The rotten share price, down by almost a quarter in the past two years, is a very long way from being “fundamentally reset”.The strategic U-turn itself, one can agree, is far-reaching. A company that until recently was still mouthing (just softly) former boss Bernard Looney’s old 2020 refrain about “reimagining energy for people and our planet” has relegated investment in low-carbon energy to 5% or less of the overall budget. Even that portion will need to be “underpinned by government support”, the finance director emphasised. And, having bought full control of solar developer Lightsource only last year, BP now wants to find a partner to share the capital load.

The Guardian,"As the far right surges around the globe, what can a new TV series about Mussolini teach us? | Caroline Moorehead","Joe Wright’s new drama gives a theatrical take on the dictator’s flaws but there is so much more history viewers need to knowOn 3 January 1925, Benito Mussolini delivered the most important speech of his life to the Italian parliament. His career was about to be over. The body of the socialist deputy and his bitter foe, Giacomo Matteotti, had been discovered in a shallow grave near Rome and mounting evidence pointed to Mussolini’s responsibility for his murder. With the king, the old liberal democratic elite, the left and many of his own party pressing for his dismissal, Mussolini declared that everything – the fascist violence, the immorality, the turmoil into which Italy had sunk – was his fault, “because I, I alone, created it”. By the same token, he alone was the man “capable of dominating the crisis”. Parliament, stunned, sat silent. There was no voice of protest. The dictatorship was saved.Based on the first volume in a trilogy of the same name by Antonio Scurati and garlanded with praise by Italian critics, the television drama Mussolini: Son of the Century covers just six years in Mussolini’s life, from his days as a brawling but highly effective journalist in Milan to his assumption of total power. Joe Wright, better known for his gentle approach and light touch in Pride and Prejudice and Atonement, has produced a series that is loud, provocative and violent. The music that accompanies it is throbbing, incessant and often intrusive, with occasional snatches of Verdi and Puccini. All is dark, deeply gloomy and sepia-coloured.

But businesses know multiculturalism is good for the economyFor people who believe that the world should be run by straight white men, these are heady times. Probably the most powerful social conservative on the planet occupies the White House again, and seems determined to drive “immoral” and “discriminatory” diversity policies out of American life.Two years ago, the US supreme court banned the use of affirmative action in university admissions. A growing list of American and British companies, from Ford to BT to Goldman Sachs, appear to be reducing their commitment to the once fashionable corporate principles of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Meanwhile, Reform UK promises to “scrap DEI rules that have lowered standards and reduced economic productivity”. In politics, commerce and education, a huge, potentially lasting counterrevolution seems to be under way.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"Starmer doesn’t do performative politics. When he faces Trump, that will be an advantage | Tom Baldwin","The PM knows there is no use picking a fight. He will try to persuade the US president that what is in Europe’s and Ukraine’s interest is also his best betTom Baldwin is the author of Keir Starmer, The BiographyKeir Starmer is neither the kind of leader to light up Britain with a shining vision of the future, nor one of those populists who reheat supposedly glorious myths from a largely imaginary national past. On Tuesday, however, the prime minister proved there are few better than him at communicating the heavy weight of decisions that bear down on him – here and now – in the present world upheaval.Indeed, from the funereal manner of his announcement, you might have been forgiven for thinking that he was saying something deeply unpopular. Yet polls have suggested for some time that about two-thirds of the public – especially those parts of it Labour fears losing to Reform – want less taxpayers’ money spent helping the poorest in the world. More funding of Britain’s defence is usually backed by voters who also strongly support Ukraine in its fight for freedom. And, most importantly of all, it has been the key demand of a president threatening to withdraw US security from Europe and whom Starmer meets at the White House on Thursday.Tom Baldwin is the author of Keir Starmer, The Biography Continue reading...","Wed, 26 Feb 2025 14:22:38 GMT",0.25,0.9392
The Guardian,"Everyone has gone nuts for pistachios. But they’re just an upmarket green peanut, aren’t they? | Emma Brockes","Encased in chocolate, blended into martinis, baked in a croissant – tasty, maybe, but let’s not kid ourselves about the health benefitsOn my desk as I write this I have a packet of shelled, unsalted pistachios, a snack about which I have no particular feelings beyond the fact they’re better for me than Hula Hoops and, like so many things I’ve been persuaded to buy by my doctor, can be integrated into a “heart healthy diet”. Pistachios are also, it turns out, having a moment. We’ve been here before, with pomegranates and acai and, a few years ago, bone broth and anchovies. Now it’s the turn of the upmarket green peanut (oh look, I do have an opinion), which, once you start noticing it, you’ll find appears to be everywhere.It started last year with the rise of what is informally known as Dubai chocolate, the so-called confectionery invented by the British-Egyptian entrepreneur Sarah Hamouda, that took over the world – and that became, according to Deliveroo, one of last year’s top items ordered worldwide. If you haven’t encountered it, the Can’t Get Knafeh Of It chocolate bar is a fancy slab of milk chocolate stuffed with a mixture of shredded filo, date syrup and pistachio cream, which tastes like a blocked artery and looks like wet tobacco. The original bar – the market is teeming with knock-offs – costs about £15.99, and if you can finish it in one sitting I raise my cholesterol to you.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Wed, 26 Feb 2025 16:59:18 GMT",-0.1655,0.9505
The Guardian,"Starmer’s cuts are a huge mistake – foreign aid is an investment, not an expense | Halima Begum","At the height of the cold war, the west advanced its soft power through aid and development spending. If we cut that now, who will fill the vacuum?Halima Begum is the chief executive of Oxfam GBThe savagely deep cuts that Keir Starmer has announced to the international aid budget make a mockery of the pledge his party made to the British people in its manifesto. Then, it promised to restore development spending at the level of 0.7% of gross national income “as soon as fiscal circumstances allow”. On Tuesday the prime minister stood in front of parliament and announced that he will cut it from 0.5% to 0.3% of GDP. In the same manifesto, Labour made a commitment to “rebuild Britain’s reputation on international development with a new approach based on genuine respect and partnership with the global south”. This week, the government turned its back on it.Of course, I understand the argument that defence spending has to be increased, but cutting our aid budget still further when governments around the world are cutting theirs too will only increase division in our already deeply divided world. More than that, cutting aid amounts to a collective betrayal of the most vulnerable and dispossessed by western leaders.Dr Halima Begum is the chief executive of Oxfam GB Continue reading...","Wed, 26 Feb 2025 11:00:33 GMT",-0.3182,-0.8894
The Guardian,The Guardian view on Starmer in Washington: don’t compromise on the truth | Editorial,"The prime minister must handle Donald Trump with tact, but without flinching from a duty to confront falsehoods in the president’s worldviewIt is hard to set expectations ahead of a summit with no useful precedent. British prime ministers have visited the White House before and in a wide variety of geopolitical contexts, but never has the hosting president been hostile to the transatlantic alliance. Never before could it be said that Washington’s foreign policy regarding European security was closer to a Moscow line than a London one.Conventional platitudes about a “special relationship” and common values are of little use to Sir Keir Starmer in handling Donald Trump. History is not&nbsp;irrelevant, but on matters of substance – most urgently, a settlement to end the war in Ukraine – Mr Trump is behaving more like a mafia boss than a statesman. His method is to demand tribute in exchange for protection.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Spain: a progressive beacon in dark times | Editorial,"Pedro Sánchez’s Socialist-led government has welcomed immigration and boosted public spending, with stellar resultsCoverage of this week’s seismic election result in Germany focused on the disturbing rise of the far right, and chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz’s warning that Europe can no longer rely on the United States for its security. But for European progressives, there was also a third depressing takeaway: the comprehensive rejection of Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic party, which&nbsp;recorded&nbsp;its worst postwar result.Across the continent, centre-left parties have been exiled from the corridors of power, while the radical right has fuelled anxieties over immigration and economic stagnation to extend its influence. There is, however, one startling outlier to this dismal trend. Last year, Spain recorded the highest growth of any major country, at 3.2%. This was achieved under a Socialist-led coalition government that has welcomed high levels of immigration as a driver of economic prosperity, and which from this year plans to offer residency and work permits to up to 900,000 undocumented migrants. In 2024, over 400,000 vacancies were filled by migrants and dual nationals, as overall unemployment figures fell to their lowest level since the 2008 crash.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Cutting aid to buy arms won’t make the UK safer | Letters,"Readers express dismay at the government’s decision to cut the foreign aid budget to pay for increased spending on defenceWhen Rishi Sunak cut the aid budget during the Covid pandemic from 0.7% to 0.5% of GDP, it was described by Larry Elliott in the Guardian as an act of “wilful political vandalism” (29 November 2020). This was partly because the amount saved, £3bn-£4bn, was “chickenfeed” in the context of a budget deficit running at 20% of GDP, but mostly because it completely undermined “the idea of aid as global public investment for the common good”.Keir Starmer’s aid cut is even more cynical, as your editorial (25 February) correctly identifies, because it is self-imposed without any economic logic to gain political traction in the Trumpian unilateralist world order. The moral bankruptcy of this approach was particularly evident in Elon Musk gleefully posting on X that “We spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper”. Starmer’s “aid for arms” announcement may find favour in the White House, but it will destroy the Labour government’s reputation and undermine multilateral approaches&nbsp;to poverty eradication when they are needed most.Stephen McCloskeyDirector, Centre for Global Education, Belfast Continue reading...","Wed, 26 Feb 2025 17:56:59 GMT",0.3182,-0.9462
The Guardian,Inside the mind of Trump – a president who talks tough but surrenders to Putin | Letters,"Trump has the classic authoritarian personality – not the same as being authoritarian, writes Mary Wilkinson, plus, letters by Tom Brown, Jim Hatley, Sally Burch and Alison RouthJonathan Freedland’s comments about Donald Trump highlighted two Trumps: the shoot-from-the-hip tough guy and the supplicant at the court of Vladimir Putin (Trump is the world’s greatest showman – and the weakest strongman it has ever seen, 21 February). Isn’t he an example of the authoritarian personality (not to be confused with being authoritarian)?Rupert Wilkinson’s 1972 book The Broken Rebel explored the subject. Some of the characteristics of the authoritarian personality that he listed are submission to a strong, admired authority; aggressive hostility to people in authority whose traits he resents, often as a result of being dominated himself in childhood or to compensate for a sense of weakness; open hostility to outsiders and admiration for his own side; a desire to be strong, to hold power and assert it aggressively; detests ambiguity and uncertainty; craves simple solutions and obvious results.Mary WilkinsonLondon Continue reading...","Wed, 26 Feb 2025 17:56:43 GMT",-0.0644,0.1184

Arne Slot’s relentless side stretched their Premier League lead to 13 points with 10 games to play courtesy of an assured victory over Newcastle. The strongest team in the league is improving while so-called title rivals falter, and Anfield knows what is coming.At 9.22pm news filtered through of Arsenal’s draw at Nottingham Forest in the earlier kick-off. The first chant of “Liverpool, top of the league” emerged from the Kop. Alexis Mac Allister soon added to Dominik Szoboszlai’s first-half goal with an emphatic finish of his own and the title-winning atmosphere cranked up. Anfield was denied the chance to roar home league championship No 19 due to the pandemic. The procession towards No 20 affords Liverpool supporters plenty of time to make amends.

They were energetic and incisive, threatening to tear Tottenham apart. Erling Haaland was back after injury and his 20th goal of the Premier League season – and 28th overall – was scant reward for their dominance.City’s previous visit to this stadium in late October had brought their first defeat of the season – in the Carabao Cup – and it is remarkable to consider how they have fared since then.

The Guardian,‘Champagne for my real friends!’ Francis Bacon masterpiece escapes to the artist’s old drinking den,"Seeing Bacon’s stunning depiction of his lover Peter Lacy hanging in a reincarnation of the watering hole where his skeletal friends would drink, stagger and cackle was a fleeting yet unforgettable experienceWhen a work of art fails to excite, interest or move me, the word that comes to mind is “dead”. Bad art is lifeless, good art is alive and great art is supervital. And it’s a supervital masterpiece I am looking at right now. Face as sharply hewn as a Congolese mask, with a flesh-coloured pullover melting into the shadows of his loins, Peter Lacy dominates the room, captured in a gold-framed portrait by his lover Francis Bacon.That room is the Colony Room Green in London, not the original Colony Room but a bar nearby that lovingly recreates, with the precision of an art installation or stage set, the bohemian drinking den run by Muriel Belcher where Bacon would order drinks all round with his famous toast: “Champagne for my real friends and real pain for my sham friends!” Its green walls are covered with art and memorabilia, including a wanted poster made by artist Lucian Freud to recover his own lost portrait of Bacon.

The Guardian,Seeking Satoshi: The Mystery Bitcoin Creator review – a documentary so thin it features the creator’s mum,"This attempt to discover the identity of the cryptocurrency’s originator is clearly a labour of love. But all the information is old and it’s so padded out it’s the TV equivalent of a Zoom call that could have been an emailWho is Satoshi Nakamoto? It’s a mystery that has vexed the internet since long before crypto went mainstream, via Silicon Valley bros and that weird period where celebrities got really into NFTs. Finding out the identity of the person who designed bitcoin – the decentralised, multitrillion-dollar currency – would be a big (and potentially dangerous) deal. Think WikiLeaks, if Julian Assange was also a potential kidnapping target with a handsome digital ransom fee. It is also – you may be unsurprised to hear – a mystery that this digital two-parter from Channel 4 does not get to the bottom of. At the outset, its journalist host, Gabriel Gatehouse (known for the BBC’s Trump podcast, The Coming Storm), warns viewers that: “The film you’re about to watch – in fact, this whole series – consists almost entirely of middle-aged white guys talking about tech”, as their middle-aged, white-guy faces flash up on screen. That wouldn’t be so much of an issue if any of these “cypherpunk” pioneers – or Gatehouse himself – had anything to say that hadn’t already been debunked on Reddit.It’s not the interviewees’ fault. Gatehouse blames a possible omertà code for their silence, but with Satoshi potentially a target for all manner of cartels, criminals and governments, why would any of these computer scientists – namely fellow Briton Adam Back, who ducks and dives away from Gatehouse at a conference in Miami – give anything away? In lieu of revelations, we get an Adam Curtis-inspired visual treatment to distract us – all film noir clips juxtaposed with old cartoons and animations of faceless automatons marching in lockstep.

The Guardian,The Last Showgirl review – Pamela Anderson dazzles as Vegas dancer hitting midlife,"Anderson’s depiction of an older performer’s struggles, as youth slips away and family fractures, rivals Demi Moore’s in The SubstanceWarm and generous performances carry this good-natured movie from director Gia Coppola; it’s actually the sort of approachable, actor-led drama for grownups that pundits complain Hollywood doesn’t produce any more. Pamela Anderson stars as Shelly, a middle-aged Las Vegas showgirl and 30-year veteran of a cheesy spectacle called Le Razzle Dazzle, gamely putting on the feathers and the sparkly rhinestones and revealing costumes alongside dancers in their teens – all for dwindling audiences who are looking for novelties and more overtly sexualised shows elsewhere.Shelly is stunned to learn that the show is getting canned and must now figure out what to do with her life and how to repair relations with her grownup daughter Hannah (Billie Lourd), who always felt she came second in her mother’s life to the pseudo-glamour of her nudie showbiz vocation. It is a film about families, adoptive families and ersatz families; the director is famously the granddaughter of Francis Ford Coppola and a cousin to producer Matthew Shire, who is married to the film’s screenwriter Karen Gersten, but this is a film with more than nepo status.

However, I now have to admit that the right clothes for the right weather can bring a freedom. Enter: the humble anorak.I spent my 20s dreading winters, which I spent freezing, only thawing out come summer.

But with adulthood came an admission that anoraks are low-key amazing. I bought one and – by keeping me dry and therefore warmer – it has, without hyperbole, changed my life.

Felicity Cloake tries out supermarket takes on chilled, ready-made chicken and vegetable soup• The best blenders to blitz like a pro, tried and testedAs a small child, my dream was to open an underwater restaurant (no, me neither), and the short menu I painstakingly wrote out for said venture started with chicken and vegetable soup. Which is to say, I have history with this dish. It feels familiar, comforting and overwhelmingly wholesome, yet I don’t often eat it these days, not least because I’ve never found one commercially that makes any welfare claims for the chicken concerned (and I’m generally too cheap to make it myself).So I was quite excited about this particular taste test – and perhaps inevitably disappointed that even the most expensive samples gave so little information about the provenance of their meat. That said, with a handful of exceptions, the standard was pretty high flavour-wise, and Aldi, Marks &amp; Spencer, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s all at least note that they use British chicken, which is a start.

From Bridgerton to The Sopranos, some have insisted on moments being axed – although they don’t always get their wayAs professional show-offs with A-list ambitions, you might assume that any TV star wants to maximise their screen time – the meatier the role and the more minutes in the limelight, the better. Yet that isn’t always the case. Sometimes, actors want their scenes to be cut, either from the script or from the edit. And they can have all sorts of reasons, from personal politics to second thoughts about stripping off.The recent Channel 4 docudrama Brian and Maggie, written by Sherwood’s James Graham, saw Dame Harriet Walter deliver a nuanced, non-cartoonish portrayal of the, let’s say, “divisive” figure of Margaret Thatcher.

Society is unspooling before our eyesEverything was going so well in my local Co-op. I’d gone in for vape juice, which they often run out of. I could see my preferred brand and I was having a comradely moment with the assistant, who is only too used to my crestfallen face when I have to make do with blueberry flavour. Then, right next to me, a man started to slither through the adjacent service hatch. The first I made of it was that the friction of his body against the counter was pulling his trousers down. I was close enough to see the whites of his pants, which were not that white. I thought: “That young man should really wear a belt next time he tries to hijack the till-cockpit of a Co-op.” Then: “NO WAY! That young man is hijacking the Co-op!”He was wearing a face bandana, so he had at least got that far with his accessorising, and he yelled at the lady to get out from behind the tills, then let his two friends in. It was a classic in-through-the-trapdoor, open-the-drawbridge manoeuvre. The manager was on the phone to the police, saying in neutral tones: “Robbery in progress, robbers in the building,” as they piled cigarettes into three giant bags-for-life, which they had definitely stolen from their mums in advance. The planning was meticulous. We watched for a few seconds, fascinated. I asked the lady if she thought we should hide and she made a noncommittal noise that I have spent ages since deciphering. It was something in the realm of “they’re just kids, they’re probably not armed”; she is probably not paid enough to defend the cigarettes.
