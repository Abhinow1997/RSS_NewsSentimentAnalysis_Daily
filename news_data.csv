Add to that the element of performance, and the worry that proving you care is measured in the messages you send … and it can all get too much.“Where has Remona gone?” panicked one friend, when I went awol while juggling a deadline, babysitting, and hosting house guests.

Sometimes, I’m happy to be entirely mute – as I was in one unnecessarily large group I was added to without consent.

This alone does not explain why the Dutchman is such an effective leader, nor why his Liverpool side are currently so successful, but it certainly helps. There are many kinds of captain, many ways of leading, but above all the one unarguably necessary thing is to be present. You cannot lead a team from the stands.At which point it is tempting to go in two-footed on Manchester United’s Bruno Fernandes, as many newspaper headlines did on Friday morning. The Portuguese is, for a couple more days at least, one of only four other captains to have played in every game of this Premier League season but that run ends with the visit of Newcastle on Monday, for which he will be suspended after Tony Harrington, just after half-time in the Boxing Day defeat to Wolves, became the third referee to show him a red card this campaign.

Yet after another disappointing performance from his side that made it six matches without a victory and allowed Brentford to pick up only their second away point of the season, the 31-year-old is being forced to confront reality.Despite creating a plethora of chances, Brighton couldn’t find a way past Thomas Frank’s battling side, who lost their goalkeeper Mark Flekken to injury in the first half and handed a Premier League debut to Hákon Valdimarsson. For all their positivity and possession under Hürzeler, in the absence of top scorer Danny Welbeck – who has been sidelined during their winless run with an ankle injury – Brighton lack a cutting edge in attack that was exposed again.

The Guardian,"Across the west, the centre right is collapsing – and with it, any notion of what is ‘too extreme’ | Owen Jones","So-called moderates are mimicking populist demagogues, with potentially disastrous consequencesIt was once known as the “centre right”, and this was the year it definitively perished. It never had a coherent political philosophy, but it tended to blend deference to the perceived needs of large business interests, the championing of so-called traditional values that were actually longstanding prejudices, and admiration for established institutions. Above all else, it supposedly offered a cordon sanitaire, preventing anything further to the right from acquiring political legitimacy.That hasn’t quite worked to plan. Nigel Farage now claims his populist-right Reform party has a higher membership than the Tories: if true, it is the first time in British history that members of a rightwing rival have outnumbered the Conservative party’s.

The Guardian,I imposed a holiday WhatsApp ban – but would my friends and family respect it?  | Poorna Bell,"After one too many moany voicenotes and streams of incessant notifications, I knew something had to changeThough my internal age is set to about 28, the time when I feel profoundly 43 is when I get nostalgic for things rendered obsolete by technology. One of those things was being able to go on holiday without being continually contacted, because the price of sending a text message was the same as a glass of wine. WhatsApp has obliterated that.Over the past year, I’ve noticed how much harder it has been to switch off as a result of the incessant flow of information. I have walked in the Polish countryside foraging for mushrooms under a crisp blue sky, while listening to a friend’s voice note about their work worries in minute detail. After I spent a glorious day out with my 10-year-old niece in Barcelona, eating dumplings and buying stickers, a friend decided to share a non-urgent but emotionally difficult update about a mutual friend’s bad health. While I was in the Maldives, after I had watched a stingray glide below me in a cobalt-blue ocean, a cousin sent me a rundown of a date where the guy had sneezed all over her food.Poorna Bell is a freelance journalist and author of Chase the Rainbow Continue reading...","Fri, 27 Dec 2024 10:00:07 GMT",0.8271,-0.5789
The Guardian,White British people aren’t under threat from multicultural Britain – they are part of it | Kieran Connell,"Reform would have you believe that multiculturalism is an act of exclusion. In fact, the opposite is the caseAs the dust settled on last summer’s English riots, I found myself taking part in a radio discussion on the question: has multiculturalism failed? It was a depressing response to events that were themselves deeply depressing: an all-too-vivid reminder of how acute Britain’s problems with racism and Islamophobia continue to be. Yet the radio discussion also showed how multiculturalism acts as a scapegoat when it comes to concerns about issues such as immigration and community cohesion. For decades now, multiculturalism has functioned as Britain’s bogeyman.There was opposition to the term almost as soon as it began to gain traction in the late 1970s and 80s. Initially, multiculturalism was associated with policies that some local councils introduced to address inequalities in education. What this meant in practice was things such as an expanded religious education curriculum, the provision of halal meat options for Muslim schoolchildren, and the distribution of information about a child’s schooling in their parents’ first language.Kieran Connell is a writer and historian at Queen’s University BelfastDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Can Europe switch to a ‘wartime mindset’? Take it from us in Ukraine: here is what that means | Oleksandr Mykhed,"Buy a power bank and write a will. You’ll need a ‘bug-out bag’ packed and ready to go.  In Kyiv, we’ve learned how to survive Russia’s hybrid warfareDay 1,024 of the invasion. Kyiv, 7am. Friday the 13th. In a former life, someone would have observed that this is a day that portends bad luck. But in a country where shelling is a daily occurrence, it has become irrelevant. I wake up to the sound of an app on my phone warning me of an increased missile threat. While my partner and I are hiding in the corridor, I read the news that the Nato chief, Mark Rutte, has called on members of the US-led transatlantic alliance to “shift to a wartime mindset”.With the first bang of the air defence system, a thought strikes me: for those who have not already been living with it for nearly three years, how would you explain this mindset?

The Guardian,"Potholes everywhere, shoplifters rampant – today’s Britain looks as broken as it feels | Simon Jenkins","This is what happens when power over public services is stripped from local councils and handed to WhitehallEvery day in Britain the police are failing to arrest about 670 shoplifters. Down the road, your median wait in A&amp;E is three hours. Meanwhile the number of care home beds has fallen by 18% in a decade, and the recent budget will cut them further. Prisons are bursting. Schools are turning away autistic children. Meanwhile, the Treasury is promising to spend £1.6bn filling in 7m potholes on England’s roads – presumably with gold.Something is badly wrong with Britain’s public sector. In the US in the 1990s, “broken windows theory” was used to explain New York’s sharply rising crime rate and a fall in the public’s sense of security. The trouble was said to lie in the city’s visible environment. Walls were covered in graffiti, trains were dirty, beggars harassed passersby. New York’s police chief, Bill Bratton, ordered the city to get to work. So called low level crime was given more attention by police. Graffiti was cleaned, litter cleared, youths made to behave and beggars moved on. The effect was extraordinary: felonies such as assault and burglary fell by more than 40%.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Fri, 27 Dec 2024 11:00:07 GMT",-0.4767,-0.9817

The Guardian,"My family call it Old Lady Clubbing, but my giddy ‘nights out’ have lit up a dismal 2024 | Gaby Hinsliff","Dance till you drop, then home by 10pm – daytime events offer a glorious escape for those of us bogged down by responsibilityLast Saturday night, I went clubbing with friends. Once upon a time, this wouldn’t have been a remotely odd sentence to type, because it was what I did pretty much every weekend. But a lot has changed since then – let’s just say that in my peak raving years there was a Labour government in power, only it was actually popular – and like most people whose happy place was once on the dancefloor, inevitably with time comes the feeling that you no longer belong. Deep down, you still come to life when the bassline kicks in. But you morph from hardened raver to the kind of person who’s always up for dancing at parties and weddings, and then finally into the kind of person whose friends aren’t getting married any more and who spends their Saturday nights giving their children lifts to parties. So eventually you tell yourself sadly that those days are over now, and that clinging on would be a bit mutton-behaving-as-lamb.Well, not any more. Enter what was almost certainly the cheeriest thing about an otherwise lousy 2024: the rise of what is now regrettably known in my house as Old Lady Clubbing, AKA daytime events specially laid on by music promoters for the over-30s. It’s like going back in time, but better: partly because this time round you have learned to wear the big coat, instead of going without and shivering glamorously to death in the queue, but mostly because it starts in the afternoon. The secret of middle-aged socialising, it transpires, is to do roughly what you always did – but earlier: hitting the club at 3pm means being home in time for the 10 o’clock news, and blissfully asleep by last orders. (Though the truly multitasking could do as one of the DJs at Day Fever, the over-35s night set up by the actor Vicky McClure and her promoter husband, Jonny Owen, reportedly sometimes does and cram in a big supermarket shop on the way back.) Even the bar staff love it, one told me, because unlike most nights there’s no hassle: everyone’s just too thrilled to be out of the house.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Fri, 27 Dec 2024 12:00:09 GMT",-0.8126,0.9868
The Guardian,The Guardian view on arms control: essential to prevent the total devastation of nuclear war | Editorial,"Over the holidays, this column will explore next year’s urgent issues. Today we look at why an unqualified belief in nuclear deterrence can’t keep us safeNext November marks 40 years since the US president Ronald Reagan and the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev declared that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought”. The statement was striking – not least because their militaries were pouring billions into preparing for an unwinnable conflict.A year later, at Reykjavik, the two came tantalisingly close to eliminating nuclear weapons entirely. That historic chance slipped away over Reagan’s insistence on his unproven “Star Wars” missile defence system. The moment passed, but its lesson endures: disarmament demands courage – and compromise.

The Guardian,Rare earths: another reason we mustn’t allow Russia to win in Ukraine | Letters,"Dictators in Russia and China should be denied further control of raw materials used in electronics, writes John E Havard. Plus a letter from Fawzi IbrahimA footnote to the excellent article by Timothy Garton Ash (What if Russia wins in Ukraine? We can already see the shadows of a dark 2025, 21 December). The so-called rare earths are essential raw materials for advanced electronics industries. China – with the world’s largest economically exploitable reserves – has a major strategic advantage in access to rare earths, underlined by the tight export controls that it has recently imposed. In Europe, it is eastern Ukraine that has the best reserves. To gain and maintain control of Ukraine’s reserves would be a major boost for Russia.A defeat here for Ukraine, enabled by the failure of the west to provide the long-term support that it has promised, would signal to China that it should not be too concerned about western resolve in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Taiwan is a dominant supplier of the advanced electronics, incorporating rare earths, that will continue to be a major determinant of economic success.

Here’s the only answer I have, 20 December), as it is a question that’s continually on my mind. There’s much substance in his well-informed piece, though the ending’s quite simple and resonates with my own take: “Perhaps by accepting that it’s the only one we have and that it’s not always so terrible – that sometimes, even quite often, it can&nbsp;be rather beautiful.”One of my responses to this ever-present question is to have gratitude for what I call “magic moments” in nature – like this morning catching sight of the heron, almost invisible, being so amazingly camouflaged among the reeds by a stream; I said “good&nbsp;morning, heron” softly, but&nbsp;didn’t linger because I’ve come&nbsp;to realise that they don’t like&nbsp;being looked at for long.

Dams and dikes are erected around the lake’s edges to protect against flooding. But this year, not for the first time, they were overwhelmed.For three days in early July, more than 800 rescue workers in Hunan province scrambled to block the breaches. One rupture alone took 100,000 cubic metres of rock to seal, according to Zhang Yingchun, a Hunan official. At least 7,000 people had to be evacuated. It was one of a series of disasters to hit China as the country grappled with a summer of extreme weather.

Every Guy Fawkes Night, Dad made sure we watched the action from inside the house.Here in Texas, things are different. I&nbsp;moved to the US in 2007, and each year, as the Fourth of July approached, containers would appear by the road, selling enormous fireworks to anyone, no questions asked.
