But given the impenetrable source material and workaday plot, it’s shrug-worthy TV at bestIs Robin Ellacott in love with Cormoran Strike? “I definitely don’t want to be,” says Robin (Holliday Grainger) of her friend and private-investigator business partner. “That’d screw everything up.” In the sixth season of Strike, a crime drama based on the sixth Strike novel by Robert Galbraith, AKA JK Rowling, it feels more than ever as though the show itself is afraid that this is true. Grainger and Tom Burke, who plays the titular Strike, do a lovely line in will-they-won’t-they romance, but the series might expire if that ever resolved itself, because the sleuthing part of it is moribund already.As a work of crime fiction, the TV version of Strike is several removes from having a compelling reason to exist. It is based on a series of hit novels – fine, nearly all detective dramas are – but these books aren’t especially well regarded.

Heroism on a scale that was previously thought unimaginable.For decades now, Prince Andrew has veered between being a national joke and a figure of shame.

The Guardian,A sea anemone: I have pronounced their name incorrectly most of my life | Helen Sullivan,"It is probably wrong to touch, even gently, these creatures. But even now I find it difficult to resistIn her book Theatres of Glass, Rebecca Stott writes about the Victorian craze for home aquariums – which swept London in the 1850s, with people taking animals from the seaside and making miniature rock pools at home in large glass enclosures or pie dishes. The craze did not last long; people didn’t have a way to oxygenate the water and most of what they collected died. 
 But among the people who loved the idea that you could create a rock pool at home was Mary Ann Evans – who wrote as George Eliot. She and her partner, the philosopher and critic George Henry Lewes, spent two summers hunting sea anemones in the town of Ilfracombe, where they were “absolutely fascinated” by what they saw, Stott says. Commenting on how difficult they found it at first to spot the anemones they had been told were as “plenty as blackberries”, Eliot wrote that it is “characteristic enough of the wide difference there is between having eyes and seeing”.Lewes, meanwhile, wrote in an article for the Westminster Review:We must always remember the great drama which is incessantly acted out in every drop of water, on every inch of earth. Then and only then do we realise the mighty complexity, the infinite splendour of nature. Then and only then do we feel how full of life, varied, intricate, marvellous, world within world, yet nowhere without space to move is this single planet, on the crust of which we stand and look out into shoreless space peopled by myriads of other planets, larger, if not more wonderful than ours.Viciously, then, I lock my door.
 The gas-fire breathes. The wind outside
 Ushers in evening rain. Once more
 Uncontradicting solitude
 Supports me on its giant palm;
 And like a sea-anemone
 Or simple snail, there cautiously
 Unfolds, emerges, what I am.At nights birds hammered my unborn
 child’s heart to strength, each strike bringing
 bones and spine to glow, her lungs pestled
 loud as the sea I was raised a sea anemone

The Guardian,How Black Doves subverts the gay best friend stereotype,"Ben Whishaw is Keira Knightley’s gay bestie in pulpy Netflix thriller Black Doves but he’s playing more than mere sassy sidekickBlack Doves, starring Keira Knightley as a spy whose cover is about to be blown and Ben Whishaw as the hitman, mentor and confidant who comes to her rescue, goes off the rails after its impressive opening episodes. One element that remains consistent, however, is the show’s blasé approach to a type of character who would once have been treated as sidekick, comic relief or exotic pet: the gay best friend (GBF). No special song-and-dance is made about the sexuality of Whishaw’s character, Sam, whose opening scene proves that he applies the same precision techniques to both business and pleasure. Whether it’s a hook-up in a hotel bar or a target in his crosshairs, Sam gets his man. “I like that he’s just this queer guy who shoots people,” Whishaw told me.Nor is Sam the only queer character in the series: there is also a smattering of snarky lesbian assassins. All of which would feel like tokenism were Sam and co not lively, vital creations with demonstrable social and sexual lives. Sam even has gay chums himself – yes, this GBF has GBFs of his own! – as well as an ex-boyfriend whose presence complicates the hitman’s work/life balance. None of this will be news to anyone familiar with the show’s creator, Joe Barton. Black Doves is cut from the same cloth as previous work such as Giri/Haji and The Bastard Son &amp; The Devil Himself, which led to Barton being commended recently on social media for “consistently delivering slutty queer anti-heroes … That’s allyship!” Continue reading...","Mon, 16 Dec 2024 15:07:41 GMT",0.7269,0.9504

The play is an adaptation of Annie Ernaux’s slim book in which, with scalpel-like prose, she details her life from the end of the second world war to present-day France. From a provincial childhood to grammar school and university, she moves through the 1960s counterculture and changes to the social order, then on into motherhood and life in the suburbs, our all-encompassing capitalism, the freedom of divorce and a late-flowering sexual awakening.Yet this is a totally incomplete way to describe it as a piece of theatre. “Annie” is played by five different actors of different ages, ethnicities and backgrounds. We play her in different periods of her life and also play the other characters: her mother, priest, uncle, children, university friends and many lovers.

I have vague memories from my childhood of carrying to school homemade shortbread on paper plates, wrapped in green or red cellophane. A generic message on a cardboard tag.

Legally binding rules that prevent government employees from accepting gifts above a certain value.

The Guardian,Trump will destroy the government agencies that most help working people | Katrina vanden Heuvel,"For all its supposed ‘populism’, the new administration will probably target offices that protect consumersThe Republican party has shellacked its clean-cut corporatism, in recent years, with a veneer of economic populism. See JD Vance’s pseudo-criticisms of Wall Street, so gestural they could be mistaken for an interpretive dance routine, or Donald Trump’s stint as a McDonald’s “employee”, which seemed more inspired by his contempt for Kamala Harris than his affection for fry cooks.But when it comes to how the second Trump administration actually intends to govern, there have already been plenty of signals that they intend to target and weaken – if not outright destroy – the parts of government most beneficial to working people. And right now, the agency most clearly in their crosshairs is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).Katrina vanden Heuvel is the editorial director and publisher of the Nation.

The Guardian,Bird flu is a real pandemic threat. Are we prepared for the worst? | Devi Sridhar,"A strain now circulating in dairy cows appears to carry little risk for humans at present, but we need to develop an effective strategy before it mutatesAs usual, I’m back with cheery topics to get us through the dark, cold winter months. No, I’m not talking about the studies on how dark chocolate reduces your risk of type 2 diabetes or why eating cake for breakfast isn’t as bad as we think it is. Instead, in the global health world, the main news is about avian flu, the H5N1 virus, and also the deadly outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo of a mystery illness. It’s in these moments that I wonder why I didn’t choose a career in baking.But trying to replicate a Mary Berry recipe would require eggs – and the United States is facing a shortage of eggs – like Britain did last year – with the main culprit being avian flu, which has either killed off or triggered the culling of hundreds of thousands of chickens. Avian flu has caused concerns recently given several step-changes in the seriousness of the potential threat: becoming endemic in wild bird populations; then its spread among domestic birds, causing a turkey lockdown in winter 2022; then reports from across the world about infections in mammals such as sea lions that feed on or live near wild birds. In the past year, a big shift has been the confirmation of mammal-to-mammal transmission among dairy cows in the US.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh Continue reading...","Mon, 16 Dec 2024 11:00:11 GMT",-0.8481,-0.9572
The Guardian,Things could go very wrong in Syria – they could also go very right. Let’s gift its people optimism | Nesrine Malik,"With the tyrant Assad gone, it’s important not to impose a negative script on what comes next. Syrians deserve support and hopeLast week, time collapsed. Bashar al-Assad’s fall recalled scenes across the region from the start of the Arab spring almost 14 years ago. Suddenly history felt vivid, its memories sharpened. In fact it no longer felt like history. Scenes that it seemed we would never see again – of crowds thronging the squares; the obscene riches of despots exposed, their fortresses stormed, their iconography desecrated – unlocked a familiar, almost sickening sense of possibility. Of giddiness, of horror at what fleeing dictators had left in their wake, and of hope. Syria’s long revolution – the death, torture, imprisonment and exile that Assad’s crushing of it unleashed – makes its successful end bittersweet. The price was so high, which makes its spoils even more dear.The moment is also different in another way. In those 14 years, other revolutions across the region either unravelled or resulted in the retrenchment of dictatorial regimes under new management. And so that sense of untrammelled optimism that followed the fall of that first crop of dictators is tempered by some wariness of what comes next. But it can and should be a productive wariness rather than a reason for despair. Because what Syria benefits from now is an understanding of the fragility of this period. To those of us who experienced it before in other countries, it felt like a time when the momentum of revolution was unstoppable and cleansing. It had a kinetic energy that swept away the old systems to be replaced by new administrations, armed with good intentions and popular support, that would simply figure it out.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Mon, 16 Dec 2024 06:00:06 GMT",0.5058,0.905
The Guardian,Have those who say Starmer is failing forgotten the madness of the Tory years already? | Andy Beckett,"The PM can’t simply sit back and hope things will settle down. But look to history: there is an inevitability about his predicamentFor anyone on the right, a Labour government under siege is one of the most reassuringly familiar sights in British politics. The party’s intermittent attempts to rule this country usually face regular policy controversies, proliferating enemies and relentless press attacks. There are often deteriorating Labour poll ratings, panicky government communications and policy lurches to the right. Minor scandals are magnified and ministers forced to resign. Despite attempted relaunches, Labour’s sense of momentum in office begins to ebb away. The many people hostile to the party look up the dates of coming elections and lick their lips.From Labour’s first short-lived governments in the 1920s and its struggling ones in the 1970s to Gordon Brown’s gloomy premiership in the late 2000s, most Labour administrations have become beleaguered sooner or later. No matter that the Tories have often been more out of their depth in office, as Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak’s administrations have recently reminded us: it’s Labour that is most associated with government as crisis management.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Mon, 16 Dec 2024 09:00:09 GMT",-0.7964,-0.9703
The Guardian,The Guardian view on local government reform: the risk is disruption but no progress | Editorial,"The white paper promises devolution. But sweeping away district councils will not drive growthGiving with one hand while taking away with the other, the government’s devolution white paper promises to empower local councils in England while simultaneously telling them what to do. Like their Conservative predecessors, ministers are mainly interested in local authorities because they recognise that they are key to economic growth. The kind of development that the government is desperate to see will not happen unless councils can work with businesses to address the need for investment in skills, transport and housing as well as jobs.Housebuilding and green energy infrastructure are at the forefront of Labour’s ambitions for the English regions. So it makes sense that the choicest offering for localists in the new legislation is the promise of increased planning powers for beefed-up strategic authorities. Metro mayors will soon have the chance to shape local rail services and to copy Andy Burnham in Manchester by introducing contactless, integrated ticketing across the buses, trains and trams that link up localities.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on political turmoil in Paris and Berlin: an ominous end to the year | Editorial,"The European Union’s two most powerful member states are plunged into introspection, as Donald Trump prepares to enter the White HouseAfter a brief weekend hiatus, action has resumed in the real-life political boxsets playing out in the EU’s two most important capitals. In the Bundestag on Monday, a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Olaf&nbsp;Scholz’s battered coalition government duly paved the way for a snap election in February. Over in Paris – where the same manoeuvre collapsed Michel&nbsp;Barnier’s short-lived government a fortnight ago – his prime ministerial replacement was putting his feet under the desk after being appointed on Friday by an increasingly desperate&nbsp;Emmanuel Macron.As Europe faces big decisions and dilemmas over&nbsp;Ukraine, how to deal with Donald Trump, and the&nbsp;challenge of China, this is no time for the continent’s fabled Franco-German engine to temporarily conk out. But there are no easy fixes in view on either side of the Rhine. In both France and Germany, the rise of the far right and a concomitant crisis of trust in mainstream politics have pointed to a&nbsp;deep political malaise for some time.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Why do we keep failing abused children like Sara Sharif? | Letters,"Readers on the death of the 10-year-old girl at the hands of her father and stepmother and the grave weaknesses in the child protection system The death of Sara Sharif yet again highlights failures to properly assess risk and protect children (What were the missed chances to prevent Sara Sharif’s death?, 11 December). But what will we learn from it? How depressing to read the statement of the children’s commissioner for England, Rachel de Souza, which says: “We can have no more reviews, no more strategies, no more debate. When we say ‘never again’, we have to mean it – let that be Sara’s legacy.”If it were that easy, wouldn’t we have found the answer after 50 years of reports into child deaths stretching back to Maria Colwell in 1973? Of course we need reviews, strategies and debates, because of the fiendish administrative and emotional complexities of child protection work. Sadly, mistakes will continue to be made. We must always have fresh strategies and debates, because child protection is a problem that is not amenable to simple sloganised solutions.

The Guardian,Staffing shortages and ministers’ illusions blight the civil service | Letters,"Dr Jamie Gough says we need more government officers, not fewer, Prof Peter Golding questions Pat McFadden’s ‘startup’ idea, and a civil servant responds to ministers’ recent comments on his and his colleagues workThe government claims that there are too many civil servants (Ministers planning to cut more than 10,000 civil service jobs, 11 December). This sits oddly with your report (11 December) that unpaid carers are still being pursued for absurdly defined “overpayments” because there are insufficient staff to deal with cases, following a cut in the number of such staff of 14% in the past two years. Staffing numbers are enough to meet the department’s financial targets, but not to deliver&nbsp;justice to carers.This situation is not exceptional but typical of all areas of the national civil service, local government and state regulatory bodies. Every public service and field of policy suffers from a shortage of officers, resulting in chaotic, inefficient or in some cases non-existent delivery of (supposed) government policies; egregious examples are PPE procurement and home-insulation grants.

Bournemouth has long been established as a relaxing seaside holiday destination but for Premier League teams it is becoming an increasingly uncomfortable, turbulent trip.

It would have been a travesty had the hosts exited the pitch empty-handed and in the end an unstoppable free-kick from 25 yards by the substitute Enes Unal, two minutes after falling behind, earned Andoni Iraola’s side a point.

The Guardian,Carry-On up the cockpit: we’ve got it in for the title of Netflix’s new airplane thriller,"A tense new American film will be landing in the UK carrying unintended innuendo. Sid James might have laughed but the studio won’tFrom time to time, a film made in the US will reach these shores with a slightly different title. Ford v Ferrari, for example, was released in Britain under the name Le Mans ’66 due to prohibitions on using brand names in British films. The Avengers was called Avengers Assemble, for fear that people might think someone had remade the terrible Ralph Fiennes spy movie of the same name. Zootopia was called Zootropolis because Disney apparently enjoys arbitrarily messing with people.What I’m trying to say is this: there is precedent here. If an American film has a title that seems like it might be problematic, or misleading, or offensive, or rude, producers have no qualms with just changing the name to something else.

The Guardian,‘People should feel there’s more than doom and gloom’: Monument Valley 3’s environmentalist hope-punk,"How the pandemic and climate migration have influenced this third outing of a formerly sterile architectural puzzle gameArchitectural surrealism is Monument Valley’s signature. Austere, beautiful structures transform and rotate at the player’s touch, creating new paths and staircases for its minimalist characters to traverse. Doorways can lead anywhere. Switches cause columns to rise out of the ground, a perspective shift can reveal a cache of hidden pathways. Since 2014 these games have been smartphone must-plays, one of the best and most elegant examples of satisfying touch-screen puzzlers. But the third in the series, released last week, is a little different.The Moroccan-inspired architecture that made the game famous is still present, but this time your geometric character Noor walks alongside blooming flowers and twisting vines, too. She sails a small boat. She gets lost in fields of bright yellow wheat. And there are many more people around her: she is a lighthouse-keeper’s apprentice, charged with the welfare of her community – which, a few scenes into the game, is ravaged by a flood. In some scenes she is accompanied by someone else, or there is someone there to rescue. It is a game about buildings still, but also a game about rebuilding, together.

The Guardian,The 50 best albums of 2024: No 5 – Beyoncé: Cowboy Carter,"This freewheeling embrace of the singer’s roots was also a triumphant reclamation of a genre that had long shunned its Black origins• The 50 best albums of 2024• More on the best culture of 2024Beyoncé weaves Cowboy Carter’s origin story into the album’s opening track, Ameriican Requiem. Against a psychedelic country-gospel backdrop that unfolds with both determination and frustration, she establishes her southern roots – Alabama, Texas, Louisiana – but notes this background hasn’t always been respected: “Used to say I spoke too country / And the rejection came, said I wasn’t country ’nough.”It was a literal story. In November 2016, Beyoncé drew criticism (and overt racism) from country purists after an exuberant performance of her Lemonade track Daddy Lessons with the Chicks at the Country Music awards. A month later, she received a stinging rebuke from the music industry when the Grammys refused to nominate the song in country categories. The subtext was clear: many people refused to accept a Black woman playing country music – and had no interest in hearing Beyoncé out.

The Guardian,Versailles: Science and Splendour review – blazing breakthroughs from stuffed rhinos to anal ops,"Science Museum, London Feats of hydraulic engineering, surgical innovations, midwifery machines … there was much more to the palace than Marie-Antoinette’s shepherdess cosplayWhen Louis XIV had an anal fistula, his doctors paced the mirrored halls of the vast palace he had built at Versailles pondering how to treat it. Eventually the Sun King agreed to an operation – a risky choice in the 17th century when modern surgery was barely in its infancy. The royal surgeon Charles-François Félix invented a curved silver scalpel to get at the fistula – you can see it in this glittering science history blockbuster – and practised on local paupers, killing several. The rehearsals worked: he fixed the royal fistula and Louis XIV lived on until 1715, his 72-year reign a world record.In Versailles: Science and Splendour a silver scalpel slices through the cliche that the French palace was a world of pure fantasy frolics. The royal surgeon’s experiments were brutal but they also illustrate how Versailles in the 1780s was spearheading science. Continue reading...","Mon, 16 Dec 2024 13:58:55 GMT",0.4939,0.0772
The Guardian,Nosferatu: The Real Story review – insightful probe into a vampire classic,"Robin Bextor’s documentary about FW Murnau’s 1922 silent masterpiece makes some sharp points but leaves noticeable holesThere are two types of vampire: one is the vulpine, Bela Lugosi-esque seducer, while the other is the “verminous” kind pioneered by Count Orlok in the 1922 German silent horror classic Nosferatu. That’s one of the sharper observations in this reasonably interesting but shakily organised documentary timed to coincide with the Robert Eggers remake; a comeback, after decades of hot vampire dominance, for the hideous original progenitor in our atavistic, post-pandemic times.FW Murnau’s Nosferatu, a first but unauthorised adaptation of Bram Stoker’s Dracula, was almost lost when the author’s widow succeeded in having most copies of it destroyed. What a loss that would have been: a sui generis masterpiece that was instigated by producer Albin Grau meeting a Serbian soldier on the western front who claimed his father was a vampire, and which compressed mass anxieties about war and disease into an oppressively deathly fable. It would surely have taken the emerging horror genre years to reconstitute Nosferatu’s visual vocabulary of eerie dissolves and other uncanny effects. Not to mention a key piece of the vampire legendarium, also invented by the film: that they are killed by sunlight. Continue reading...","Mon, 16 Dec 2024 15:00:21 GMT",0.0,-0.8912

For people prone to eating disorders, this can lead down a dangerous pathWeeks after giving birth to my son in early 2022, I found a lump in my breast. After an ultrasound, it was deemed suspicious and required a biopsy. The two-week wait for results was terrifying, not least because I have a family history of breast cancer. The chronic eczema I have always suffered from flared up, thanks to stress, sleep deprivation and the upheaval of early parenthood.The lump turned out to be benign, but the experience brought my mortality into sharp relief and my anxiety levels to new highs. After treating my skin with round after round of prescription medication, to little avail, I became committed to “naturally” curing the eczema, staving off disease and perfecting my already cautious diet.

For a 65kg (143lb) person that might mean eating a chicken breast, 200g (7oz) of Greek yoghurt and an egg (57g of protein). That figure rises slightly if you work out. “The average couch-to-5K runner might need 1.2g per kg,” she says. If you are trying to build muscle then that could rise to 1.8-2.0g per kg.

The Guardian,Gotta lotta bottle: doing the rounds with Britain’s last milkmen – photo essay,"Their floats were once a regular sight, quietly whirring down the country’s streets, delivering daily pints. Photographer Maxine Beuret captures the vanishing world of electric milk floats (and their drivers)You often hear them before you see them: the unmistakable clink and tinkle of glass bottles in crates, and the low whine of the electric motor. Milk floats are a uniquely British sight, and an increasingly rare one, which is why the British photographer and cultural historian Maxine Beuret has spent 20 years documenting their use by dairies across England, as part of her project Two Pints Please.Beuret, who calls herself a historian of the commonplace, has documented several quirks of British culture that are at risk of disappearing (or have since gone), including slam-door commuter trains, TfL’s Routemaster buses before they were decommissioned, and traditional shops in the Midlands including a sweet shop, a men’s outfitters and a hardware store. She first photographed an electric milk float while undertaking another project called Familiar Interiors of Leicester – her hometown – in 2005. As well as creating a record of the library, the hospital, the pub and other cherished places, she visited the local dairy, Kirby &amp; West, and “instantly fell in love” with the milk floats, she says. “I&nbsp;loved the compact, functional design, clean lines, and fragile sense of history they carried with them.”Overlooking the yard at Parker Dairies Continue reading...","Sat, 14 Dec 2024 08:00:10 GMT",0.0,0.765
