The Guardian,"Ukraine war briefing: Biden-approved weapons still flowing, says Kellogg","Trump to push European allies to buy US arms for Ukraine – report; Zelenskyy expected to meet with JD Vance and US envoy Kellogg. What we know on day 1,084See all our Ukraine war coverageWeapons approved under Joe Biden’s presidency are still flowing to Ukraine, the new US special envoy to Kyiv, Keith Kellogg, said on Monday. “There’s not necessarily any need in the next 24 hours to [do] it any different,” Kellogg said in an interview with the Reuters news agency.The Trump administration plans to push European allies to buy more American weapons for Ukraine – as they did under the Biden administration – ahead of potential peace talks with Moscow, Reuters has reported, citing two people with knowledge of the matter. Kellogg will discuss this with European allies this week during the Munich security conference, which begins on Friday, Reuters said, citing its sources. The development, if confirmed, may be reassuring to Ukrainian leaders that the flow of arms will continue.Kellogg declined to confirm the plan to Reuters but said: “The US always likes selling weapons made in America because it strengthens our economy. There are a lot of options out there. Everything is in play right now.” It is believed that administration officials view an arms purchase deal with Europe as a potential workaround, allowing Washington to support Kyiv without spending US taxpayer dollars. The Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, has said Europe would pay for US arms for Ukraine.On the potential for peace talks, Kellogg told Reuters: “I wouldn’t say we’re at the beginning of the [peace planning process] because we’ve been thinking through it,” adding that US officials in Munich would “deliver our expectations to the allies … More importantly, we want to hear from them”.Donald Trump on Monday confirmed that Kellogg would soon visit Ukraine. A source in the Ukrainian president’s office told Agence France-Presse that Kellogg would arrive in Ukraine on 20 February. Zelenskyy spokesperson Sergiy Nikiforov told AFP that Ukraine’s president would meet with the US vice-president, JD Vance, on Friday on the sidelines of the Munich conference.The pro-Russian separatist region of Moldova, Transnistria, rejected on Monday a new European gas offer despite experiencing a severe energy crisis since Gazprom deliveries via Ukraine stopped. Separatist leadership said the region would instead take Russia-financed gas transported from Hungary, which receives gas from Russia via the Turkstream pipeline through Turkey. Moldova has criticised the whole affair as a destabilisation tactic by Russia. “The European Union’s offer was a solution to free the territory from blackmail and energy instability” but “Russia won’t allow it to accept European aid because it is scared of losing control” of the territory, said the Moldovan prime minister, Dorin Recean.

The Guardian,"Virdee review – tremendous, tantalising, action-packed fun","You will have a wild ride watching this ineffably cool Bradford-based cop thriller. But it’s also surprisingly moving – and may well leave you in tearsIf Virdee is what we get to mark the naming of Bradford as this year’s city of culture (congratulations, Bradford!) then I’m going to need it to be so anointed until at least 2029. The six-part thriller is an adaptation by Amit Dhand of his own book City of Sinners. It’s the third in a series set in the troubled West Yorkshire town and centred round Detective Harry Virdee and his conflicted personal and professional loyalties, and I am going to need them all.This is a switchbacking ride from the off. We open with a man apparently on the run from the police, until it turns out he is the police. Virdee (Game of Thrones’ Staz Nair) is in pursuit of the man he suspects can give him the whereabouts of missing teenager Ateeq Farooqi (Yousef Naseer). But, after the eventual arrest, he is taken to task by his brother-in-law Riaz (Vikash Bhai) for not letting him handle the matter “unofficially”. They are on the same side here, he insists to Virdee. A missing kid is bad for business. It is clear that Riaz is a very shady brother-in-law indeed, but neither Virdee the man nor Virdee the show is in the habit of lingering, so with the first of many tantalising set-ups complete, he is off to a friend’s wedding to plunge us into the maelstrom of difficulties that is his private life.Virdee aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.

This hidden, shameful family history was almost lost to time, almost forgotten, but Kiefer couldn’t let that happen. So he put on the overcoat and “Sieg Heil”-ed all across Europe, taking pictures along the way. This early art project in the late-1960s was the German artist attempting to embody and confront the past.A picture of him doing the banned salute – forbidden in Germany under the long process of denazification – is at the heart of this show of his early works. He stands, arm raised, against a barbed-wire fence in shimmering, solarised black and white. It’s a ghostly and quiet photo, but amazingly powerful in its simplicity. That overcoat became a historical burden for Kiefer to bear in the first gesture of an artistic career dedicated to raking through history so that it would not be forgotten, or repeated.

Shrink-wrapped foam blocks. Designers reveal the secrets of faking drugs onscreen – from popping sugar pills to snorting vitamin D‘Suitcases of drugs are not exactly something you’d expect to bring to work,” says Paul Cross, who was the production designer of Supacell, the crime-laced superhero series that launched last year. Cross has had to handle quite a few in his time though, albeit fake. He recently found himself driving around London with a vanload of fake cocaine bricks. “It’s quite an odd feeling,” he says. “Not something you’d do in your day-to-day life.”From hip teen shows to crime dramas, scenes involving drugs are often pivotal in modern TV series – and ensuring these moments are safe, legal and realistic has become so important to producers that thousands of pounds can be spent on getting it right. For every brick of fake cocaine off-loaded into a fake drug den, someone like Cross has spent weeks crafting the perfect powder texture. For every pill taken by an actor, a huge amount of toil has gone into making sure it’s not harmful. Continue reading...","Mon, 10 Feb 2025 16:00:47 GMT",-0.5423,-0.5191

The Guardian,Donald Trump has declared war on international justice. Australia must speak up | Geoffrey Robertson,"The ICC sanction is designed to intimidate and stop it from working against war criminals, Geoffrey Robertson writesDonald Trump has declared war on international justice by the dictatorial device of an executive order. He has sanctioned the international criminal court. This empowers him to seize any funds belonging to the court or its judges or employees and to ban them from entering the US. He issued a similar sanction, during his previous presidency, but it was overturned by Joe Biden before court challenges to it could be heard. This time it will prevent ICC leaders from entering New York to report to the UN and will end cooperation to provide evidence to ICC prosecutors for action against Russian commanders. The greatest beneficiary of Trump’s sanction will be Vladimir Putin.Australia is one of the 125 state members of the ICC but, inexplicably, it has not yet spoken out against Trump’s puerile initiative. Seventy-nine state members immediately did so, with allies including the UK, Germany and France describing their support for the court’s independence, impartiality and integrity as “unwavering”. They warned that Trump’s decision might imperil the confidentiality and safety of victims of the crimes being investigated.Geoffrey Robertson AO KC is the author of Crimes Against Humanity, the Struggle for Global Justice, the next edition of which is published by Penguin this month Continue reading...","Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:38:12 GMT",-0.128,0.9186
The Guardian,Trump is driving political debate to ever new lows. The left must hold on to its values | Zoe Williams,"Even his most ridiculous executive orders have an ugly effect on politics around the world. We can’t just ignore the US president. But nor can we succumb to the momentum of the rightThe problem with Trump’s America is that everything happens so fast, and across too many categories. There are moves so stupid and trivial that you can lose hours wondering whether there is a long game or if it’s all just trolling: renaming the Gulf of Mexico, bringing back plastic straws. There are moves so inhumane, causing so much deliberate suffering, that they are hard to fathom. The cancellation of USAid is so consequential that reaction has almost frozen in place, as the world figures out which immediate humanitarian crisis to prioritise, and waits for some grownup, such as the constitution, to step in. Into that baited silence steps Elon Musk, with a hoax about the agency having been a leftwing money-laundering organisation. Then everyone hares off to react to that, first debunking, then considering, what it might mean, for a man of such wealth and power to have come so completely unstuck from demonstrable reality. This is not an accident – and yet it has no meaning. So why is he doing it? To galvanise a base, or make a public service announcement that observable reality can’t help you now, so get used to having it overwritten by fantasy? It’s an understandable thing to worry about.Then there are the chilling direct legislative moves against sections of US society: banning the use of any pronouns that are not male or female in government agencies, defunding gender-affirming medical care, signalling a ban on transgender people in the military with an executive order that says being trans “conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honourable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life”. There’s the assault on immigrant rights, which is vivid and wide-ranging from the resurrection of Guantánamo Bay as a for ever holding-house, to the shackled people deported to Punjab, to the reversal of a convention that schools, churches and hospitals would not be raided by  Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

There are several, varying definitions, but ultimately it comes down to the same answer: a large group of people bound together through shared culture, history and language. For us in Cymru, the idea of a Welsh nation is something about which we are pretty sensitive and protective. Our most provocative historian, Gwyn Alf Williams, said that Wales has “from birth … lived with the threat of extinction” and that the survival of Welsh nationhood is “one of the minor miracles of history”.To those of you who mainly know Wales through the occasional holiday, the Six Nations and Gareth Bale, this might sound an odd thing to say. After all, whenever you see Wales or Welsh people represented anywhere they are loudly and unequivocally, well, Welsh. Continue reading...","Mon, 10 Feb 2025 12:17:15 GMT",-0.5859,0.5041
The Guardian,Drax is the subsidy show that goes on and on | Nils Pratley,"Government cranks handle again for group owning Yorkshire power plant because cheaper generating capacity not in placeUK halves subsidies for Drax and says it must use 100% sustainable woodSurprise, surprise, a mighty £7bn of subsidies since 2012 have not been enough to get Drax to stand on its own feet. More bungs are required to keep the wood fires burning at the enormous power plant in North Yorkshire – this time an estimated £1.8bn from 2027-31.The energy minister Michael Shanks at least sounded embarrassed. He railed against the “unacceptably large profits” Drax has made, said past subsidy arrangements “did not deliver a good enough deal for bill payers” and vowed that that the definition of a “sustainable” wood pellet would be tightened. But the bottom line is that the government has agreed to crank the subsidy handle once again, just at a slower rate. Continue reading...","Mon, 10 Feb 2025 18:33:30 GMT",0.0,0.3176
The Guardian,The Guardian view on Trump’s trade betrayal: rhetoric hides trickle-down economics on steroids | Editorial,"The US president’s tariffs pose as worker protection, but they’re a smokescreen – his bluster trades US credibility for a $4.6tn tax-cutting giveaway to the richIn 2020, Donald Trump scrapped the North American free trade agreement, replacing it with the “United States Mexico Canada agreement”, which he bragged was “the fairest, most balanced, and beneficial” trade deal ever. That agreement between the three nations explicitly bans tariff hikes beyond what was agreed. Yet, on his return to the White House, Mr Trump immediately threatened steep levies on goods from Canada and Mexico – the US’s key allies – retreating only after they made token concessions on drugs and illegal immigration. Now, he’s vowing fresh steel and aluminum tariffs, a direct hit on Canada.Mr Trump is exploiting presidential emergency powers to push these tariffs with no real constraints. The bottom line is the US is breaking its word. Friends, such as the EU and the UK, as well as opponents like China are also under threat. Allies will think twice before signing deals with Washington, fearing future betrayals. Yet Mr Trump’s administration doesn’t care – it thrives on defying global norms. Skipping this year’s G20 summit – citing host South Africa’s focus on diversity, equality and climate action, alongside Elon Musk’s fixation on white South African farmers – Mr Trump’s team is mulling an exit from the IMF and World Bank.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Kosovo’s election result: a gateway to rapprochement with the EU,"A new coalition government may seek to rebuild bridges with western partners, at a perilous geopolitical momentSeventeen years after Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, its future remains shadowed and compromised by relations with Belgrade. More than a decade of normalisation talks have so far been a road to nowhere, stymied principally by Serbia’s refusal to recognise its former territory’s right to the attributes of nationhood. In the country’s four northern Serb-majority municipalities, the deadlock has occasionally turned deadly as Kosovo’s prime minister, Albin Kurti, has attempted to enforce sovereignty, resisted by Belgrade-backed rebels.There are tentative grounds for hoping that the outcome of Kosovo’s latest election on Sunday, in which Mr Kurti’s ruling party came first but lost its majority, can deliver a route out of this impasse. Mr Kurti’s understandable but sometimes heavy-handed moves to demonstrate Pristina’s control over the north – such as imposing ethnic Albanian mayors after a mass election boycott by ethnic Serbs – have been strongly criticised by both the European Union and the US. On the eve of the poll, Richard Grenell, the newly appointed US special envoy for special missions, said that relations between Washington and Pristina had “never been lower”.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"Benefits system should protect, not punish, vulnerable people | Letters","Labour’s focus on crackdowns and fraudsters lodges in the psyche, feeding precarity and self-doubt, says Dr Jay Watts. Plus a letter from Stephanie O’Brien Frances Ryan underestimates the effect of repeated attacks on benefits claimants and the damage that the potential changes being floated would unleash (As Labour touts more brutal cuts to benefits, how is this different from life under the Tories?, 5 February). As a mental health clinician, I cannot emphasise enough how many relapses have been triggered by the relentless media drumbeat about “cracking down” on benefits. This is not just political rhetoric; it lodges in the psyche, feeding precarity and self-doubt.When the government frames itself as the defender of the public purse at the expense of “fraudulent” claimants, it makes nearly all claimants feel like frauds. To combine this with the terrifying reality of what these speculative reforms could mean – sanctions for those too unwell to comply with back-to-work schemes, and the appalling prospect of removing or gutting the limited capability for work and work-related activity (LCWRA) group that overwhelmingly consists of people at substantial risk of mental collapse – is unconscionable.

A&nbsp;seriously impressive defence, it was just a pity they weren’t playing. Instead, Marcelo was there so they could pay homage to the full-back, who won 25 trophies with the club, in the week he announced his retirement. The other four had come to join him and support their teammates. None were dressed in white; all are injured.All of which would be bad enough, but it was about to get worse. The following afternoon, having been named in the squad to travel to Manchester, the captain pulled out too. In the past fortnight Lucas Vázquez had missed visits to Valladolid and Leganés as a precaution but eventually he too fell, calling from home after Sunday’s training session to say something wasn’t right in his thigh. He was the backup, a midfielder at full-back, albeit one who has played there for so long now that it has become his default role. There have been 36&nbsp;injuries at Madrid this season, 26&nbsp;of them muscular. Continue reading...","Mon, 10 Feb 2025 22:00:02 GMT",0.1027,-0.1979
The Guardian,"White cornerback, Black QB: did Eagles grab ultimate DEI Super Bowl win?","Observers have jokingly pointed to Cooper DeJean as a diversity hire for the NFL champions. But they have succeeded by challenging outdated ways of thinkingBy now, those who watched Sunday’s Super Bowl have most likely forgotten about the house ads promoting racial and cultural unity. That’s no doubt because a much stronger statement was delivered midway through the second quarter when a pass by the Kansas City Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes was intercepted and returned for an touchdown by Philadelphia’s Cooper DeJean.DeJean, the first white player to start at cornerback in a Super Bowl in 24 years, has cheekily been described by media figures such as Bomani Jones as the league’s ultimate DEI hire.

According to my favourite Wikipedia wormhole, that’s just one of the many possible ways our universe could bite the bullet some 100 quindecillion (give or take a few septillion) years from now.To me, Wikipedia’s seemingly innocuous Timeline of the far future page (along with its existentially harrowing cousin, Ultimate fate of the universe) is the perfect encapsulation of the internet’s inbuilt dissonance: monolithic in meaning but oh-so pedestrian in its presentation. It offers a snapshot of mind-boggling scientific theory wrapped up in a boring, colour-coded spreadsheet, built and tended to by faceless back-end contributors who are probably goosing up Elon Musk’s own Wikipedia page at the same time as they’re casually cataloguing the theoretical extinction of the Y chromosome 5m years from now.

The Guardian,Cyndi Lauper review – still showing her true colours in fun farewell tour,"Co-op Live, ManchesterThere’s still no-one else like the 71-year-old star: she gives rambling speeches and accidentally hits someone with a recorder, but her voice punches through the chaosWithin 10 minutes of appearing on stage, Cyndi Lauper has sung about masturbation, played a tuneless recorder solo, accidentally hit a crew member with said instrument, and given a rambling speech about wrestlers, the Goonies and how, after more than 40 years in music, this will be her last tour. “I figured if I was going out,” she says while sporting a mint-green wig, “I’d go out with a bang.”That’s certainly one way to describe the approach to the Girls Just Wanna Have Fun Farewell Tour, Lauper’s first (and now final) arena shows since 1987. The tour began last year in North America, although that time on the road hasn’t reined in the chaos: the show is all over the place. Along with the incident involving the recorder, Lauper is plagued by technical difficulties, poor sound that buries her voice beneath an admittedly slick band, an uneven setlist, dodgy costumes, and her own garrulous monologues.

The Guardian,From Brad Pitt’s F1 to Lilo & Stitch: the year’s big Super Bowl movie trailers,"The US’s biggest TV night of the year saw new looks at 2025’s most anticipated movies, costing studios $8m a spotWhile there might have been a brief uptick in the viewership for recent awards ceremonies, the act of communal live TV watching is still not what it used to be. In the US, the one constant is sport and while weekly games might only appeal to an impassioned subset of fans, the Super Bowl’s broader appeal makes it the most attractive night of the year to advertisers, their big chance to make an impression with an audience that’s typically over 100 million.It’s also inevitably the most expensive with a 30-second spot costing about $8m this year – a record amount – and so it’s left up to the biggest of the big companies to get involved. On the film side, that translated to just Paramount, Disney, Universal and Warners flashing the cash but was it money well spent? Continue reading...","Mon, 10 Feb 2025 14:40:42 GMT",0.5994,0.7715
The Guardian,"‘Unusually soft, mushy, oddly bland’: the best (and worst) baked beans, tasted and rated by Felicity Cloake","Our resident perfectionist applies her forensic insight to the high street’s baked bean offerings• The food filter: which supermarket has the best extra-virgin olive oil?Baked beans are one of those homely foods that are so familiar that most of us don’t give them even a second thought on the shelf – we reach for our usual brand, tick it off the list and reserve our mental bandwidth for more exciting foodstuffs. After all, just how different can a tin of beans be? To my surprise, I discovered very striking disparities between the ones I tested, so if you’re someone who routinely decants excess juice or reduces the sauce to achieve that authentic school dinner effect, you might be better off simply switching allegiance. Similarly, the sugar content varied between 9% of your recommended daily allowance to 13%, so if that’s a concern, look out for reduced- or no-sugar brands instead.There’s a significant price difference between supermarket own labels and the leading brands, too. If you’re after a gourmet experience, I’d recommend the Bold Bean Co’s rich tomato baked beans (£3.50), because they remind me of those homemade beans you sometimes get with a fry-up at fancy cafes: intensely savoury and packed full of herbs. They don’t qualify here, because they are to ordinary baked beans what rye sourdough is to white sliced, but they’re bloody lovely all the same. That said, you can’t go wrong with any of our best buys served on buttered toast with a light dusting of grated cheddar. Small pleasures don’t come much cheaper.

He said authorities had had 'no prior warning signs' of the attack, which happened soon after 12.30pm at a campus housing an adult education centre and other learning facilities, and that it was believed the gunman acted alone.Sweden shooting: 10 people dead after attack at education centre in Örebro, say police – latest updatesSwedish police say about 10 people dead in Örebro campus attack Continue reading...","Tue, 04 Feb 2025 19:50:59 GMT",-0.8555,-0.9918

The Guardian,"The big picture: wedding celebrations in London’s Banglatown, 1991","Wayne Tippetts’s shot of young Bangladeshi women preparing for a Gaye Holud ceremony is part of a series exploring a pivotal moment in the  neighbourhood’s historyWayne Tippetts took this picture in what became known as Banglatown – the area between Brick Lane and Whitechapel High Street east of the City of London – in 1991. Tippetts was, he recalls, in the habit at the time of walking up from near the river at Wapping where his photo agency, Select, had its offices, and taking pictures of the Bangladeshi community, families who had mostly arrived in London in the 1970s. Tippetts’s pictures have now become a monograph that captures a pivotal moment in the history of that ever-changing part of London, when second-generation Bangladeshis were starting to assert their cultural identity, and to feel fully at home.In this image, the photographer recalls, “young Bangladeshi women, known as ‘sakhis’, friends of the bride, had gathered outside her home on a council estate in Tower Hamlets”. The women were preparing to shower other guests from the balcony with yellow and red flower petals and sweets during the Gaye Holud ceremony, a pre-wedding tradition. Though embracing the customs of their parents, Tippetts notes, the young people he met, including these young women, were at that time balancing that heritage with “multicultural influences of fashion, music, and youth subcultures that were flourishing in the city at the time”.Wayne Tippetts – Banglatown, London 1991 is published by Café Royal Books (£6.70) Continue reading...","Sun, 09 Feb 2025 07:00:42 GMT",0.0,0.743
The Guardian,Where the heart is: the artist memorialising homes lost in the LA fires – in pictures,"On 10 January, as fires raged across Los Angeles, local portrait artist Asher Bingham made an offer via an Instagram reel: “ To anyone that has lost a home in the #LAfires I will draw [it] for free.” She had already drawn the house of a close friend that had burned down; by offering her services more widely, she hoped to help others grieve for what they’d lost. She wasn’t prepared for the response. So many people sent in photos – 1,300 and counting – that she had to recruit volunteers to keep up with demand. For Bingham, it’s all about the small details: wind chimes, potted plants. “Anywhere I can see people put love into their home, I draw it,” she says. “I’m trying to recreate a memory that only lives in their minds of the beautiful time they lived there.”See more on instagram.com/asherbingham.fineart Continue reading...","Sat, 08 Feb 2025 17:00:26 GMT",0.4404,0.8428
