Yet, the writer reveals, Orbital is actually ‘a celebration of Earth’s beauty with a pang of loss’ – fuelled by her anxiety-induced insomniaSamantha Harvey very nearly gave up on her novel Orbital, which last night won this year’s Booker prize. Set on the International Space Station (ISS) 250 miles from Earth, Orbital follows the day-to-day lives of four astronauts and two cosmonauts as they hurtle through the universe at 17,500mph. She was a few thousand words in and suddenly lost her nerve. She felt she was trespassing in space. “I am so spectacularly not an astronaut,” she laughs, when we meet for coffee the morning after the Booker ceremony. “I’m so unadventurous, so unaudacious, so impractical, cowardly, anxious. I would be terrible.”After a few months of dabbling with other ideas, she opened the abandoned word document on her computer by mistake. When she read it she found it had an integrity and pulse that drew her more than any of the other projects she was working on. “I thought, ‘I shouldn’t be afraid of this. If I can do it in a way that’s different to the way astronauts write about their time in space, then maybe there’s something here.” So she climbed back in and achieved lift-off.

The Guardian,Secrets of the Spy Whale review – the bizarre tale of how Russia used a cetacean as a secret agent,"The alleged operative surfaced in 2019 wearing a camera harness labelled ‘equipment of St Petersburg’ – but sadly this documentary is thin on other detailsSpy Whale does exactly what it says on the tin. It’s a documentary about a whale that was, in all probability – if not in all cetacean consciousness – a spy. For the Russians. In 2019, a beluga whale who would eventually be named Hvaldimir (a portmanteau of the Norwegian word for “whale” and Putin’s first name) approached a fishing boat off Ingøya Island, virtually the northernmost point of Scandinavia. It was wearing a harness that was cutting into its flesh and appeared to be seeking help, as intelligent marine mammals are known to do.The boat’s captain, Joar Hesten, radioed for help from Jørgen Ree Wiig – whose job at the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries it is to free whales who get caught up in fishing equipment – and kept Hvaldimir with the boat by feeding him fish until Wiig could travel the five hours to meet them. Together they eventually got the harness off. There is footage of their achievement, which involved Hesten risking his life by joining the distressed whale in the freezing water. “People had put him in this situation in the first place,” he says. “We had to make it right.” Hesten is the calmest man you will ever meet. If you were a panicking beluga whale stuck in a harness, he is the man you would want at your side. When the last buckle finally opens, “it is one of the best moments of my life,” he says. “I just wished him luck on his journey.” Continue reading...","Wed, 13 Nov 2024 22:30:55 GMT",-0.3182,0.9209

Sign up hereBy 2004, video games were well into their adolescence. The war between Sega and Nintendo that defined the early 1990s was in the rear-view mirror – the PlayStation had knocked both of them off their perch, and Microsoft had released the Xbox. The critical and commercial hits of the day were not cartoon platformers but operatic space shooters (Halo) and anarchic crime games (Grand Theft Auto). There were lots of guns, and most games were embracing increasingly cinematic cutscenes.Nintendo, meanwhile, had fallen into third place with its Game Cube home console – but it still owned the handheld game market with the Game Boy Advance. Everyone was expecting the next iteration in the Game Boy family. But instead, Nintendo released a strange-looking silver clamshell console that you controlled with a stylus.

The trailer for Hot Frosty, Netflix’s newest foray into Hallmark’s holiday territory, promised to answer the question no one was asking: what if Frosty the Snowman had abs?Curious minds do, in fact, want to know. Thankfully, the actual finished product, 90 minutes of extremely unserious, occasionally sweet fluff written by Russell Hainline, delivers logistical and spiritual answers to the quandary of Half-Naked Alive Snowman with complete dedication to the genre. Said snowman, Jack (Dustin Milligan), awakens with barely a strategically placed scarf to cover him.

There have been no consequencesThis is a story about an apparently invincible fortress: the west’s official narrative about Israel’s war on Gaza. No matter how depraved the atrocity, or overwhelming the evidence, or confessed-to the crime, the fortress will not crumble. In fact, even when Israel flagrantly insults its main sponsor, the US, as it did this week, nothing changes.The case in point here starts with a letter that the US sent to Israel last month, which set out in detail how life-saving aid was being systematically blocked from entering Gaza and threatened undefined action if specific demands to reverse the siege were not taken within 30 days. As the Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen suggested, the letter was a political ruse to woo voters in the run-up to the election (given most Democratic voters correctly believe that Israel is committing genocide).Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

After 14 wretched years of Tory austerity, stealth privatisation, draconian outsourcing, the Brexit staff drain and the horror and trauma of Covid from which – as you know – staff haven’t remotely recovered, the big NHS plan is to be … naming and shaming? Complete with inflammatory language that’s designed to scapegoat staff, such as the bad managers you’ve branded the NHS’s “guilty secret”? Do you genuinely think this is constructive?At a point when Ofsted – having contributed to the suicide of headteacher Ruth Perry – has finally rowed back from its absurdly blunt tool of one-word school inspection ratings, it beggars belief that the new health secretary thinks hospital league tables will help the NHS. Streeting insists the new public rankings are a necessary way of stamping out poor performance. He wants hospitals judged on quantifiable factors such as A&amp;E waits, cancer care and the size of their budget deficits. Trusts will be publicly ranked from best to worst, with the CEOs of the worst offenders facing dismissal. Meanwhile, the best-performing trusts will be rewarded with extra money to buy new equipment or repair facilities, further skewing the playing field.Rachel Clarke is a palliative care doctor and the author of Breathtaking: Inside the NHS in a Time of Pandemic Continue reading...","Wed, 13 Nov 2024 14:47:24 GMT",-0.2023,-0.8924

On Wednesday morning, this was the news that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy had been appointed by the president-elect, Donald Trump, to run something called the Department of Government Efficiency, a newly created body tasked with cutting back federal bureaucracy and given the larky acronym Doge. (Musk has been a longtime promoter of the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, so there’s a great conflict-of-interest gag straight out the gate.)On X, Musk duly posted an image of himself in gangster pose, with digitally volumised hair alongside the lettering D.O.G.E, the message of which was clear: cutting $2tn from the federal budget, a figure touted by Musk before the election, was going to be not only satisfying, but fun!Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Wed, 13 Nov 2024 15:44:23 GMT",0.0,-0.1028

The Guardian,Thames Water should explain its murky logic on fundraising,"Transparency around this emergency process has been miserable as company looks for approval to borrow £3bn moreCongratulations to Thames Water: it is not going bust early in the new year. Probably. The necessary three-quarters of A-class bondholders have backed a proposal for the company, already drowning in £15bn of debt, to borrow another £3bn at the nose-bleed rate of 9.75% plus a hefty serving of fees on top. And, critically, the numbers are looking good to get permission from bondholders to access £400m of cash reserves.A court still has to approve the new £3bn of “super senior” funding – meaning debt that ought to be super-safe because it ranks above both the A class of bonds and the junior Bs. But if that hurdle is cleared next month, Thames will have shoved its debt mess around another U-bend. The script then imagines a more permanent restructuring of the finances – surely with hefty debt write-downs – at some point in the next 18 months. The company may also take a detour to the Competition and Markets Authority to appeal against Ofwat’s final proposal (also due next month) on bills for the next five-year period.

His words were not all milk and honey. Take, for example, this passage from the gospel of Matthew: “If anyone causes one of these little ones – those who believe in me – to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.”Catherine Pepinster is a writer on religion and a former editor of the Tablet, the Catholic weeklyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But everything I try just makes it worseThere are several problems with my face, not least of which is that I look so bloody miserable all the time. Honestly, I’m usually smiling inside. A nice woman stopped me in the street on Sunday to tell me that she never looked very happy either. We were kindred spirits, she said, because she, like me, had a resting not-happy face.She turned out to be a vicar, and said that when she did manage a smile, her congregations were very relieved and pleased. Nice. While I don’t have a congregation of my own, I knew what she meant. But still I think it’s time to change my face. Not with the help of a surgeon, you understand – I just need to give my countenance a bit of a lift.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on NHS reform: evidence not dogma should be the guide | Editorial,"The health secretary is right to link investment to accountability, but he must be wary of creating perverse incentivesFor any government contemplating NHS reform, the 2012 Health and Social Care Act is a textbook case of what not to do. Despite promises of “no more pointless reorganisations”, the Tory health secretary Andrew&nbsp;Lansley did just that, abolishing management tiers and imposing new care commissioning and competition systems on reluctant doctors.The whole thing was a political nightmare that wasted resources, demoralised staff and undermined public confidence. In an independent report published earlier this year, Lord Darzi described the Lansley method as “scorched earth”, from which NHS management capacity has not yet fully recovered. And that was before the full social cost of austerity had weighed on the health service, and before it had been battered by the Covid pandemic.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Lords shake-up: meaningful change goes beyond scrapping birthright | Editorial,"MPs are right to abolish hereditary seats in the upper house. However, Britain needs a representative second chamber fit for modern democracyMore than a century ago, the 1911 Parliament Act restricted the House of Lords’ powers under threat of a flood of Liberal appointees. The act boldly declared that “it is intended to substitute for the House of Lords as it at present exists a Second Chamber constituted on a popular instead of hereditary basis, but such substitution cannot be immediately brought into operation”. This “temporary” measure has become a historic understatement, frustrating those who seek reform – including this newspaper.MPs took a step forward this week, voting to abolish hereditary peers in the Lords. The bill aims to end the 92 seats reserved for those inheriting titles through paternal lineage – a long-overdue decision. It completes what Tony Blair began in 1998 when ministers tried to expel those in the Lords by birth. The hereditary principle is a relic. While royalty endures ceremonially, inherited political power undermines equality, representation and accountability in government.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Why the left is losing respect and elections | Letters,"Colin Montgomery says people are tired of being told how backwards they are if they don’t play along with priggishness, while Martyn Thomas ponders societal changes. Plus a letter from Dan RaineyIn John Harris’s article (From Trump’s victory, a simple, inescapable message: many people despise the left, 10 November) there is a nugget of text that best describes the abominable mess the “left” (a catch-all descriptor which is in itself part of the problem) finds itself in, because it beautifully expresses both the problem and solution for those of a progressive bent in one fell swoop – albeit he delivers them in reverse.It came when Harris spoke of an agenda often “expressed with a judgmental arrogance, and based on behavioural codes – to do with microaggressions, or the correct use of pronouns ...”. That rings true with many people who aren’t that fussed with identity politics (or politics in general) and feel alienated by those who are.

Despite our farm being relatively small, we too have been feeling the immediate stress and worry of Labour’s budget announcements, and thousands of others are similarly feeling the strain (Tax changes in budget last straw for UK farmers after ‘years of being squeezed’, 8 November).Mental health has always been a massive issue in the farming industry.

The Guardian,"Bob Dylan review – melancholy, reflective, but still utterly unpredictable","Royal Albert Hall, London He may be well into his ninth decade but his seasoned sidemen are still racing to keep up with mercurial twists on new and old songsYou could infer a lot from the way Bob Dylan’s backing band arrange themselves on stage. They form a kind of huddle around their leader, who these days performs mostly at a grand piano centre stage: sometimes seated, more often standing, occasionally not playing it all, but leaning against it, elbows on the lid, as he sings or plays harmonica. Perhaps there’s something protective about this formation. After all, Dylan is now 83; quite an age to be on the ninth leg of a three-year world tour. But even as an octogenarian, Dylan very much gives off the air of someone who can look after himself, thank you.It seems more likely their position speaks of a state of high alert. These are musicians for whom the term seasoned professional was invented – longstanding crack sessioneers, men whose collective CV encompasses everyone from Paul Simon to Steely Dan to sundry former Beatles – and yet you somehow get the impression that even they aren’t quite certain exactly what’s going to happen next. An artist who pronounced himself freewheelin’ in 1963 seems no more inclined to keep to any script 61 years on. Best to stick close to the guy in charge and keep your eyes peeled for clues as to where he’s headed. As they hawkishly follow his unpredictable vocal phrasing and a piano style that’s simultaneously florid and ragged – Art Tatum by way of Les Dawson – he’s still capable of wrongfooting them: there are moments when you could swear the band start building to a climax or slowing to a conclusion, only to discover their leader has other ideas.

Suddenly, we see and hear Malcolm X giving a speech at New York’s Harlem Square in 1960. It’s like being shaken from a delicious reverie and thrown into the ice bath of reality.“You’ll never get Mississippi straightened out,” Malcolm X snaps at the Harlem crowds, “until you start realising the connection with the Congo.” The curious connection between Black Americans’ fight for civil rights and the second-largest country in Africa is the subject of Johan Grimonprez’s documentary.

The Guardian,"‘Bad boy come again!’ The life, death and resurrection of jungle MC Stevie Hyper D","His ultra-fast rapping ruled 90s raves and influenced garage and grime, but he died young and fell into obscurity. The makers of a new documentary revisit his brilliance‘Steve is the Jesus Christ of MCs, man. He died for all these guys.” With a chuckle, Darrell Austin is lionising his uncle Steve – who under the moniker Stevie Hyper D was the 1990s’ main man in live drum’n’bass MCing.A swaggering, gap-toothed, stentorian town crier for the scene at key raves like One Nation and Dreamscape, he was credited with accelerating the fastchat of Caribbean soundsystem MCs into exhilarating “double-time” rapping, which defined the sound of jungle and pointed the way towards garage and grime. He also coined or popularised many of the rudeboy battle cries doing the rounds at the time: “Bad boy come again!”; “Junglists, are you ready!” Then, after dying of a heart attack in 1998 aged 31 on the eve of releasing his first album, Stevie Hyper D fell into obscurity. “When I first met Jamie, I was still very raw and bitter about how Steve’s legacy was being handled,” Austin says.

The Guardian,‘A phenomenon’: how World of Warcraft smashed out of geekdom and conquered gaming,"The ultimate multi-player has survived ‘frat boy’ slurs, a ropey film, one mega lawsuit, legions of change-averse puritans – and Mr T in a Night Elf Mohawk. As it hits 20, join us on a trip to the green hills of Stranglehorn In 2004, Holly Longdale was a game designer on EverQuest, then the champion of a new genre of video game that allowed for multiplayer role-playing on a huge scale. In these online fantasy worlds, players could quest together rather than alone, adding a fascinating new social – and competitive – dimension to the static, offline role-playing that Holly’s generation had grown up with. But whenever she could, Longdale would sneak in a few hours playing EverQuest’s main competitor instead. That game was World of Warcraft (WoW).“There were so many moments in WoW I was envious of,” she says, “and completely lost in. I remember running through Ashenvale as a Night Elf Hunter and the music and the ambience – there was a mood you couldn’t deny. Then I saw another player running in the opposite direction, a Druid who buffed me on their way by. That was when I knew I was going to be in this for the long-haul.” Twenty years later, Longdale is now WoW’s VP and executive producer at its developer, Blizzard, as well as one of millions who embraced the game as part of their lives.

It’s amazing how three little letters can encompass something so big. From sexual identity to sexual pleasure, sex can mean so many things. But what about sexual wellness? And what does sexual wellness, in the context of menopause, even mean?Wildly open to interpretation, I’d say my sexual wellness anchors around three things: the mind (as in desire or lack of), the body (relating to both comfort and discomfort), and the soul (should I really be enjoying/pursuing sex given the broader stereotypical view when it comes to older women and sex?).

After years of stop-start relationships and a broken engagement, he led me to a happier worldWhen I got engaged in 2002, I was 33. Somehow, after growing up on a self-sufficient farm in the 1970s, I had bolted to London at 17 and ended up in the fast lane as a freelance journalist, writing about sex, parties and cars. My 20s were full of stop-start love affairs and crazy jobs. I was unsure of who I was, scared, fun-seeking, defensively cynical and desperate to write, and I suspect I wasn’t entirely lovable or reliable. But after meeting my fiance I thought I was on the home straight to a wedding and kids.About a year into our engagement, I pitched an idea to a women’s magazine. What if I hosted a dinner party for 12 single people to “see what happens”? The magazine agreed, saying they’d confirm the details later in the summer.
