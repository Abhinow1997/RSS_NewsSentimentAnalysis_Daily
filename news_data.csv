The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Ukraine ‘captures two North Korean soldiers in Russia’,"Pair being interrogated in Kyiv, with intelligence agency SBU saying one had fake Russian military ID; Russia claims control of village near PokrovskSee all our Ukraine coverageUkraine said it was interrogating two North Korean soldiers after capturing the pair in Russia’s Kursk region – the first time it has announced the capture of North Korean soldiers alive since their entry into the war last year. The president, Volodymyr Zelensyy, said on X on Saturday the soldiers were captured by Ukraine’s special forces and were being interrogated by the SBU domestic intelligence agency in Kyiv. The SBU released a video showing the two men in hospital bunks, one with bandaged hands and the other with a bandaged jaw. It said their questioning was being done in Korean with the help of South Korea’s NIS intelligence agency. Neither Russia nor North Korea immediately reacted to the announcement.The SBU said the two captured North Korean men had told interrogators they were experienced army soldiers, and one said he was sent to Russia for training, not to fight. It said one PoW carried a Russian military ID card “issued in the name of another person” while the other had no documents. The SBU showed an ID issued to a 26-year-old man from Russia’s Tyva region bordering Mongolia, adding that he was a rifleman born in 2005 and had been in the North Korean army since 2021. The other man, who wrote his answers because of his injured jaw, said he was born in 1999, had joined the army in 2016 and was a scout sniper, the SBU said.Zelensyy said it was difficult to capture North Koreans alive because “Russians and other North Korean soldiers finish off their wounded” to cover up “evidence of the participation of another state, North Korea, in the war”. He said he would provide media access to the prisoners of war because “the world needs to know what is happening”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andriy Sybiga, wrote online: “We need maximum pressure against regimes in Moscow and Pyongyang.”Russia said its army had gained control of a village near the eastern Ukrainian logistical centre of Pokrovsk, a key target in its advance through the Donetsk region. Ukraine’s military made no mention of the village of Shevchenko in its latest account of frontline activity, but said Russia had launched more than 50 attacks against its forces’ positions near Pokrovsk in the past 24 hours. The Russian military report said its troops launched strikes with aircraft, drones and missiles on Ukrainian military airfields and energy infrastructure that service its army. Ukraine’s general staff said its forces repelled 46 of 56 Russian attacks around about a dozen towns in the Pokrovsk sector. Ten clashes were continuing. The governor of the part of Donetsk region held by Ukrainian forces, Vadym Filashkin, said one resident was killed and four injured when a village north of Pokrovsk came under Russian shelling.Russia launched 74 drones at Ukraine overnight, Kyiv’s air force said early on Saturday, adding it had downed 47 of them, while 27 others disappeared from radar without reaching their targets. The air force said buildings and vehicles in seven different regions were damaged by falling debris from downed drones, but there were no casualties.Ukraine launched drone attacks across several regions of Russia, striking two houses in the Tambov region and injuring several people, Russia said on Saturday. Ukraine denies attacking civilian targets in Russia. The regional head, Evgeny Pervyshov, said on Telegram that people were treated for injures resulting from shattered windows as drones hit two houses in the town of Kotovsk, 480km (300 miles) south-east of Moscow. The Russian defence ministry said it intercepted and destroyed 85 Ukrainian drones overnight in several regions of the country, including 31 drones over the Black Sea, 16 each in the Voronezh and Krasnodar regions and 14 over the Azov Sea.Vladimir Putin awarded Russia’s highest honour for bravery on Saturday to Cpl Andrei Grigoryev after a widely posted video showed him killing a Ukrainian opponent in hand-to-hand combat. Ukrainian media identified the soldier killed as Dmytro Maslovsky from the southern Odesa region. Continue reading...","Sun, 12 Jan 2025 02:34:55 GMT",-0.5994,-0.9948

The Guardian,Our Tiny Islands review – wonderful proof that it is still possible to live a life of contentment,"This fascinating documentary looks at people who have traded modern life to live on minuscule British islets. Its script might be banal, but their existence is a joy to seeOur Tiny Islands is dangerous television. Ostensibly the gentlest of concepts, this four-part series of hour-long documentaries narrated by Meera Syal is about life on some of the hundreds of minute, ancient islands scattered off Britain’s coastline. Not your Lundys, Lindisfarnes or Merseas – which are Manhattan, Vegas and Dubai compared with what is on offer here – but scraps of land where birds and wildflowers outnumber humans by thousands to one, the only transport is boats or bikes and life is what you make it. It is paradise for introverts.We are talking about the likes of Rathlin, a puffin-stuffed 14.5 sq km (5.6 sq miles) off the coast of Northern Ireland, home to 150 people including ferryman Tom and assorted RSPB staff and volunteers who are preparing to rid the place of rats and ferrets – non-native species whose appetite for eggs is causing the island to become less puffin-stuffed than it once was. Or Tresco, much of whose 1.15 square Cornish miles are taken up by the Abbey Gardens established in the 19th century by the then proprietor (whose family now leases the island from the Duchy of Cornwall) and which are now overseen by head gardener Andy and his wife, Kate.

Michael Chabon has called him “one of the best writers of dialogue in the history of American literature”. Born and raised in the Bronx, he lives in Harlem – the setting for his new novel, Lazarus Man, in which four strangers cross paths amid the collapse of a tenement block.The book’s acknowledgments mention its “incredibly long gestation”...
 I signed the contract to write this 17 years ago; if it was a baby, it’d now be applying to college. I’d just written Lush Life, a sort of panorama of the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and I wanted to try to do the same for Harlem, but I’d only just moved there. New York City is 1,000 cities – move five blocks, you’re in a different one – so I had to live there a while to pick up the nuance. Plus, I was in a new relationship and it took about two years to calm down: it’s not just get up, write, sleep, get up, write, sleep, you know. And I needed dough – you can’t live on royalties from a novel – so I was doing TV serials. Also, honestly, I was intimidated: I’m a white writer in a time where people are very sensitive to who gets to write the stories of who. When I wrote Clockers, there wasn’t that policing of language; the whole world became hyperconscious, probably in a good way. Continue reading...","Sat, 11 Jan 2025 18:00:10 GMT",0.3612,0.8765

Salcedo, 65, has long made herself a channel of collective trauma, her art expressing profound anger at political crimes and atrocities at home and abroad – as well as creating imaginative spaces for mourning. Her hair project, she says, comes in response to what she has come to think of as “domicide”: the calculated bombing and destruction of places that people call home.“Most of my work is a response of some kind to war,” she says. “And we have all witnessed – of course for decades in Colombia, but also now in Ukraine and Syria and Sudan and in Gaza – this destruction of houses for the sole purpose of escalating human suffering. In Gaza some people have rebuilt their houses several times and seen them destroyed again. So I was thinking, how does it feel to be somewhere where there are no bricks, no concrete, no wood, absolutely nothing you can build with? And I thought: OK, it’s like a spider, wanting to construct something from inside. So I’m trying to make a gigantic spider web house out of human hair. And on top of being made out of human hair, it’s being ripped apart.” Continue reading...","Sat, 11 Jan 2025 16:00:07 GMT",-0.6249,-0.963

The Guardian,Sam Moore was more than a Soul Man – he was one of the 20th century’s great live performers,"Sam &amp; Dave singer’s electrifying artistry was revered by musicians ranging from Bruce Springsteen to Mariah CareySoul Man singer Sam Moore dies aged 89 from surgery complicationsSam Moore had put out a Christmas album in 1998, but it wasn’t until 2006 that he released his debut solo album proper. There was clearly something tongue-in-cheek about its title. Overnight Sensational arrived a quarter of a century after the duo he had formed with Dave Prater had finally broken up after decades of acrimony: before the split, Sam &amp; Dave had not actually spoken to each other for 13 years, Moore horrified by a domestic incident in which Prater had shot and wounded his wife.That it took so long for one of the most lauded figures in 60s soul to release an album under his own name says something about the difficulties Moore faced in establishing himself as a solo artist. Part of the problem was that Sam &amp; Dave’s career had been on the commercial skids ever since they stopped recording at Stax Records’ Memphis studio and working with the songwriting and production duo of Isaac Hayes and David Porter in 1969: fatally, when Stax’s deal with Atlantic Records had ended, the pair stayed on Atlantic, rather than moving to Stax. Moore was also dogged by heroin and cocaine addiction in the years after the duo’s split, claimed that someone had been spreading a rumour that he was suffering from throat cancer in an attempt to harm his career, and had spent most of the 80s still competing with Sam &amp; Dave, Prater having responded to their break-up by simply recruiting another singer called Sam and carrying on as before.

The Guardian,Penaud leads brilliant Bordeaux in 11-try Champions Cup humiliation of Exeter,Pool 1: Exeter 17-69 BordeauxDamian Penaud scores hat-trick in masterclassThe gulf between the top French sides and the Premiership’s lower reaches grows wider by the week. First Toulouse and now Bordeaux have travelled to Exeter this season and been so markedly superior that a boxing referee would have stopped the fight long before the end. This was not even the visitors’ strongest team and it still resulted in a record drubbing.There was never much chance of this rebuilding Chiefs squad punching above its weight in this season’s Champions Cup anyway but they finished an embarrassingly distant second against opponents who exuded attacking class all day and could go deep in the competition if their key men stay fit and the Six Nations does not stall their momentum.

The Tunisian, whose sublime skills and smile have lit up the women’s Tour over the past decade, reached the Wimbledon final in 2022 and 2023 and earned herself the nickname Minister of Happiness.Somewhere along the way, Jabeur lost the joy. Keen to start a family, she had told herself if she won Wimbledon in 2023, that would be the perfect time to take a break. It didn’t happen – she lost to Marketa Vondrousova – and so continued playing. But injuries, illness and the scenes of human suffering in Gaza made her struggle over the past year.

The Guardian,Joan Didion and Mike Davis understood LA through its fires. Even they couldn’t predict this week,"Fire is an inextricable part of the region’s identity, as the writers knew. But the way this divided city burns has been transformedTalking about fire and Los Angeles is an exercise in repetition. Southern California does have seasons, Joan Didion once noted in Blue Nights, among them “the season when the fire comes”.Fire in Los Angeles has a singular ability to shock, with its destruction that takes “grimly familiar pathways” down the canyons and into the subdivisions. The phrase comes from the writer and activist Mike Davis’s 1995 essay The Case for Letting Malibu Burn, and it is as true for the fires as for our talk of the fires. Even our reflections take on that grim familiarity: we cite Didion citing Nathanael West. We fall in with the great writers of this great city who are always so ready to judge it.

The Guardian,Jane Austen’s plates or the woods near her home? I know which I’d rather save | Martha Gill,"Why this hierarchy of heritage? Our obsession with buildings and artefacts is blinding us to the value of natureI was struck last week by a story about Alton, a town in Hampshire, where residents have hit on a new basis for object to development in the area: Jane Austen sometimes used to walk there from nearby Chawton. The surrounding landscape, a petition reads, is therefore an important part of our literary heritage and must not be built on.On the one hand, this is a story about nimbyism and the lengths to which people will go to try to prevent the nightmare of local housebuilding: months of extra noise, increased traffic, a destroyed view and the headache-inducing realisation that complaining about any of this will probably put you in the wrong. After all, as some smug person living outside the development zone will rightly remind you, Britain badly needs more houses and we have to build them somewhere.

The Guardian,"Joe Biden got plenty right at home, but on the world stage he let himself be taken for a fool | Simon Tisdall","In another era, the outgoing president would have made a great cold war leader. Instead, his tenure was dogged by errors, naivety and overcautionIn a week when the US bade a sad farewell to Jimmy Carter, presidential legacies came under particular scrutiny. Yet few presidents are widely remembered beyond their lifetimes, their “historic” achievements even less so. In the 20th century, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D Roosevelt, John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon make the truly memorable list. Most of the rest are mere school-book names and dates.Joe Biden’s standing in this unprepossessing pantheon is now being assessed, as he prepares to depart the White House on 20 January. Like his 44 predecessors, he reportedly frets about his “place in history”. All presidents do this. It smacks of vanity.

The Guardian,We built our world with fire. Now heat is destroying our lives | John Vaillant,"We fell in love with the power and speed that fossil fuels brought us. But the price being paid in California, and around the world, has become too highZero per cent contained. In layperson’s terms, that means “out of control and burning at will”. It’s a common designation for a wildfire – in the wild. But when a fire like this enters an urban area such as Los Angeles County, the most highly populated metropolitan area in the US, it becomes an exploding bomb, and this one has been detonating since last Tuesday.By now, the energy release from this wind-driven, drought-fuelled firestorm turned urban conflagration is into the megatons, and the nuclear-scale destruction is there for all to see: block after block and neighbourhood after neighbourhood levelled – roughly 12,000 structures destroyed or rendered uninhabitable, 55 sq miles of city and mountain burnt, nearly 200,000 residents evacuated – so far.

It’s 1995, cargo pants were slung low, Oasis were riding high. We were all going to Live Forever. And then the New York supreme court ruled against a long-forgotten company called Prodigy, which hosted online message boards. An unknown user had posted a message that the brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont (which had inspired The Wolf of Wall Street) had committed fraud. Stratton Oakmont sued for defamation and a crucial question was asked: was the site that hosted the comment responsible for it, in the way a traditional publisher would be for a comment on its letters page? The court decided that, because Prodigy had moderators and content guidelines, it was responsible. Another company that didn’t moderate had previously gone unpunished.

The Guardian,Trump’s punishment for his crimes? None | Moira Donegan,"At many points, it looked as if he never would be sentenced. That he was sentenced to nothing, then, is itself a small victoryWhat kind of a sentence, exactly, is an “unconditional discharge”? When Judge Juan Merchan, of New York, issued the sentence on Friday, he declared that Donald Trump, convicted in his courtroom of 34 felonies, will face no jail time, no probation and no fine for falsifying business records in order to conceal an affair he had with the adult film actress Stormy Daniels in the days leading up to the 2016 election. His punishment, that is, is that there will be no punishment at all.Trump was never likely to get jail time, which would have been unusual for any defendant faced with these charges, and over the past days Merchan had signaled that he would not impose probation, either. And maybe that’s just as well – any punishment or sanction at all that he had imposed on Trump would have been likely to be appealed and suspended, at least for the duration of Trump’s time in office. There was, that is, no formal mechanism really available by which the criminal justice system could punish Trump for the crimes he was convicted of. “This court has determined that the only lawful sentence that permits entry of judgement of conviction without encroachment on the highest office of the land is a sentence of unconditional discharge,” Merchan said, explaining his reasoning: there is no way to punish a man who is about to be the president. In a sense, the sentencing merely confirms what many of us already know: that by virtue of who he is, Trump is beyond the reach of consequence.

The Guardian,"The Observer view: With Hollywood ablaze, ditching carbon targets would be an act of recklessness | Observer editorial","Legislation aimed at limiting the US’s role in global warming is likely to be an early target of Donald TrumpThe devastating wave of wildfires that has reduced thousands of Hollywood homes to ashes could not have afflicted the US at a more telling moment. Figures released last week revealed that for the first time the world overshot the 1.5C limit in global temperature rises that had been set as a desired upper figure by the Paris climate accord of 2015.It is clear that the floods that engulfed Valencia last year, along with the typhoons that ripped through the Philippines and the drought that afflicted the Amazon were all made more likely by this unwanted temperature rise, say scientists. From this perspective, Hollywood’s misery is just one of many examples of the destruction heaped upon the planet by our burning of fossil fuels and ever-rising emissions of greenhouse gases. Crucially, such disasters are only going to worsen until humanity abandons the widespread combustion of coal, gas and oil. Continue reading...","Sat, 11 Jan 2025 19:00:15 GMT",0.0,-0.9487
The Guardian,The Observer view: Donald Trump’s imperial bullying must be nipped in the bud | Observer editorial,"Countries that cherish democratic values need to take a stand against the president-elect’s throwback to unabashed American expansionismWatching politicians promise one thing, then do another, is a common experience in all democratic countries. Situations in which voters do not expect a politician to keep his word, and in many instances fervently hope and pray he will not, are rarer. Donald Trump, the US president-elect, fits this latter category. When Trump threatens to subjugate Canada, a Nato ally, by force, unilaterally annex Greenland, the autonomous territory of a friendly EU state, and override Panama’s sovereignty for bogus security reasons, most people assume he is not serious and his remarks carry little real significance. This response, while comforting, is a mistake.It’s entirely possible that Trump, pumped with hype, hot air and testosterone in the lead-up to his 20 January inauguration, is being gratuitously disruptive. He likes to shake things up. It amuses his Make America Great Again (Maga) hyper-nationalist fanclub. It may be that this former property developer and convicted felon, who counts himself a shrewd negotiator, is deliberately raising the stakes before more reasoned discussions about security and trade. But it is also possible Trump means what he says. Continue reading...","Sat, 11 Jan 2025 18:00:10 GMT",-0.5994,0.9227
The Guardian,"From racism to ableism, Of Mice and Men still sparks a debate | Letters","Readers respond to a piece by Nels Abbey on the book’s place in schools and share their perspectives as students and teachersHaving taught Of Mice and Men for 30 years in multicultural schools in London, I wholeheartedly agree that it is a difficult, problematic novel to teach in secondary school classrooms, particularly because of some of the characters using racist slurs (Would you drop Of Mice and Men from the exam syllabus? The answer isn’t black and white, 6 January). However, to imply that it is educationally redundant does not acknowledge other important positive messages it contains, still relevant today, that do not appear in less problematic alternatives.During the 1930s, John Steinbeck was inspired by marine biologist and ecologist Ed Ricketts to describe how survival ultimately depends on diverse individuals or groups collaborating and working towards collective benefits. In his novels, Steinbeck champions the inclusive diverse group over the individuals holding power. He provides a counter argument to the sweeping enthusiasm for eugenics in California at that time.

If those landings go well, then the first crewed flights to Mars will be in four years.”Then came a grand restatement of even more impressive intentions. “[The] flight rate will grow exponentially from there,” he wrote, “with the goal of building a self-sustaining city in about 20 years.” For those who still doubt whether this plan ought to be quite the priority he evidently thinks, he finished with a familiar insistence: “Being multiplanetary will vastly increase the probable lifespan of consciousness, as we will no longer have all our eggs, literally and metabolically, on one planet.”Although Mars’s volcanoes are no longer active, some of its dune fields are. Wind blowing from the north drives dunes of dark basaltic sand across the floor of a small crater Continue reading...","Sat, 11 Jan 2025 11:00:01 GMT",0.0,0.5625

The Guardian,The food filter: who makes the best crunchy peanut butter?,"From Whole Earth and Meridian to supermarket staples, which is the best crunchy peanut butter, and how much do you really need to spend on it?The best tinned tomatoesI came late to the peanut butter party, and my mum remains convinced that it’s extremely unhealthy stuff, which, to be fair to her, is probably true of the sugary versions of my childhood. In the past few years, however, peanut butter has gone back to its health-food roots. It is now championed for its protein and monounsaturated fat content, as brands stripped of their sweeteners and emulsifiers have occupied the premium end of the market. Given that these new-wave natural peanut butters tend to contain nothing but peanuts – give or take the odd pinch of salt – the difference between supermarket own-label and luxury jars tends to be slight. The biggest variations are largely in the sourcing and quality of the peanuts themselves.This means that peanut butter is a handy thing to have in the cupboard at all times. Personally, I prefer a loose, crunchy consistency; for all the claims about sustainable palm oil, there’s simply no need for it in peanut butter, which, like tahini, separates naturally over time and is just as easily stirred back together. To slow the separation, simply beat the oil back in, then store the jar upside down in the fridge – assuming it lasts that long. Continue reading...","Sat, 11 Jan 2025 10:00:10 GMT",0.6369,0.7966

The Guardian,"‘I don’t like being revered’: Brian Eno on art, AI, and why he hates talking about David Bowie","He’s worked with some of the biggest names in music, but his latest book claims there’s an artist in all of us. Brian Eno and co-author Bette Adriaanse discuss the myth of genius, and how to really unlock your creativityBrian Eno’s studio in Notting Hill is tucked away at the end of a cobbled mews, its facade a quarter of the normal size. The effect is like a kind of fairy-door, and as you enter, it opens on to a vast light-filled room with a spiral staircase at the centre. On one side, Eno, in a purple shirt, is hovering silently over a table top making marks on something. On the other, his latest collaborator, the Dutch artist and writer Bette Adriaanse, busies herself with the same task (they’re signing copies of their new book about art). An airy piano melody wafts over the scene: entering it feels like exhaling.It does for me, anyway. I’ve been anxious about this interview, not least because of a warning from Eno’s assistant to avoid talking about his musical history, which he doesn’t feel is relevant; she apologises for flagging it up but thought she had “better be safe than sorry”. Eek. A few years ago a Guardian interviewer was given short shrift for daring to ask about Eno’s famous collaborations (“I so don’t want to talk about this,” a sleep-deprived Eno snapped).

The Guardian,Maria review – Angelina Jolie excels as tragic Callas,"Jolie goes full-blown diva in Pablo Larraín’s reverential portrait of the great soprano – a thoroughly operatic affair steeped in hauteur and griefThe final film in Chilean director Pablo Larraín’s triptych of portraits of wealthy, influential, melancholy women, Maria stars a magnetic Angelina Jolie as autocratic, temperamental soprano Maria Callas. Like Jackie and Spencer it’s a film about grief. But what Callas mourns, in the week leading up to her death in September 1977, is not a husband, as with Jackie Kennedy, or a marriage, as with Diana, Princess of Wales, but the loss of her younger self: the celebrated prima donna whose career broke records and whose voice broke hearts.Naturally, Maria is steeped in opera. It’s present in the mise-en-scène, which turns the streets of 70s Paris into a grand stage, complete with full orchestra and chorus. La Divina, Jolie-style, is as much a performance as a person – a diva who never encountered a rococo staircase she couldn’t imperiously sweep down. There are operatic levels of drama, too, in the costume choices: fur, brocade and anything that can be swished are favoured.In UK and Irish cinemas Continue reading...","Sat, 11 Jan 2025 15:00:06 GMT",0.128,-0.8519

Making it was as much of a high-wire act as the show itself, the film’s director Jason Reitman and stars revealThere is no show in history more obsessed with its own lore than Saturday Night Live. Almost every week the long-running sketch show is sprinkled with returning alumni and jokes that reference the show’s illustrious and controversial past: its social club status for the great and good of New York; the drug-fuelled deaths of its brightest lights such as John Belushi and Chris Farley; the superstars it created in Eddie Murphy, Bill Murray, Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell and Tina Fey, to name but five of hundreds.SNL is so fabled that it’s already inspired scores of documentaries and numerous scripted TV shows based on it, including 30 Rock and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. In February, there will be a three-hour primetime special celebrating the show’s 50th anniversary, an event likely to be more starry than the Oscars (at a similar event for the 40th anniversary, Taylor Swift, Paul McCartney and Prince formed an impromptu band to entertain the afterparty).

Many new restaurants are said to be “much anticipated”, but in AngloThai’s case it has been anticipated for so many years now that many had given up hope of it ever becoming a reality.But you realise almost the moment you walk through the door where all that time went, because creating something as beautiful as this takes money and a great deal of planning.

The Guardian,Couldn’t put it down: David Hurn’s photographs of people reading – in pictures,"In 1983 David Hurn met one of his photographic heroes, André Kertész , and jokingly suggested that, when he reached Kertész’s age of 89, he would remake his seminal volume, On Reading. True to his word, the Magnum photographer has now done so. Wherever Hurn travelled as a photojournalist, he took images of people reading books, magazines and, lately, on mobile phones. “One of the things that happens in every country in the world is people read,” he says. “It’s lovely to read – the touch of the paper, the ease of being able to check back a few pages. But we’re at a time now where we’re not quite sure whether, in the future, books on paper are going to disappear.”David Hurn’s On Reading is published by RRB Photobooks (£35) Continue reading...","Sat, 11 Jan 2025 17:00:09 GMT",0.0,0.6336

It’s not uncommon for people here to step away from the office grind for a while and find solace in lunchtime sports. Where we were meeting, a startup company had set up a&nbsp;basketball and tennis court to bring their employees together and encourage a social spark.” Continue reading...","Sat, 11 Jan 2025 10:00:08 GMT",0.891,0.9109

The Guardian,On asphalt we grow: the skateboarders of Ukraine,"Amid the devastation in Ukraine, the photojournalist Robin Tutenges has captured how skateboarding provides a vital escape for the country’s young people – an act of resilience and freedom as they reclaim the streets in the face of conflict and traumaFar from the frontlines, the streets of some Ukrainian cities may seem to be returning to a semblance of normality, but nothing is quite the same. War imposes itself at every turn, between the shell-torn buildings, the sandbags on the corners of caulked windows and the antitank obstacles – dozens of them are piled up under a tarpaulin, as pictured below. By reclaiming these scarred spaces, Ukrainian skateboarders want to give themselves permission to live. To regain control of their lives in the face of a war that blurs their bearings.‘Ukraine is like a jail you can’t get out of and Kyiv is my cell.
