The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Nato warns that Putin wants to ‘wipe Ukraine off the map’,"Nato secretary general Mark Rutte says people should gird themselves for the prospect that Russia might try to use ‘swarms of drones’ in Europe. What we know on day 1,024Nato secretary general Mark Rutte has warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to “wipe Ukraine off the map” and could come after other parts of Europe next. Rutte told the Carnegie Europe thinktank in Brussels it is “time to shift to a wartime mindset” and that people should gird themselves for the prospect that Russia might try to use “swarms of drones” in Europe as it has to deadly effect in Ukraine. The former Dutch prime minister was making his inaugural speech just over two months after he took office as Nato’s top civilian official.US President Joe Biden announced another package of weapons aid for Ukraine on Thursday, valued at $500m, secretary of state Antony Blinken said in a statement. White House spokesperson John Kirby said earlier the US would continue to provide additional packages for Ukraine “right up to the end of this administration.” Washington said 10 days ago it would send Ukraine $725m worth of missiles, ammunition, anti-personnel mines and other weapons. Biden’s outgoing administration is seeking to bolster Ukraine in tackling Russia’s invasion, before Biden’s term ends in January when president-elect Donald Trump takes office.In a wide-ranging interview with Time magazine, US president election Donald Trump offered his thoughts on global affairs, including the war in Ukraine. The president-elect has previously derided US aid to Kyiv. Pressed on whether he would abandon Ukraine in its efforts to stave off Russia’s invasion, Trump said he would use US support for Kyiv as leverage against Moscow in negotiating an end to the war. “I want to reach an agreement,” he said, “and the only way you’re going to reach an agreement is not to abandon.”Ukraine’s top military commander says fighting around a key eastern Ukraine city is “extremely intense” after a months-long Russian push. Analysts estimate Russian forces are now within just a few kilometres, or miles, of Pokrovsk. Ukraine’s general staff said on Thursday that Ukrainian troops had repelled nearly 40 Russian attempts to storm defences around Pokrovsk over the previous 24 hours. Ukraine’s stretched defences in Donetsk have been creaking since early this year under a fierce Russian drive. Pokrovsk is one of Ukraine’s main defensive strongholds and a key logistics hub in the Donetsk region.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff said in an interview broadcast late on Thursday that Kyiv was not yet ready to start talks with Russia as it lacked the weapons, security guarantees and international status that it sought. Andriy Yermak’s comments to public broadcaster Suspilne come as Zelenskyy publicly considers the possibility of a negotiated settlement to the war with Russia, launched by Moscow’s full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February 2022. “Not just yet today,” Yermak told Suspilne, when asked whether Ukraine was ready to embark on talks. “We don’t have the weapons, we don’t have the status that we are talking about.”French President Emmanuel Macron and Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said Ukraine must have a pivotal role in any potential negotiations over Russia’s war in the country, after a meeting Thursday in Warsaw. Macron also insisted Europeans must be involved in security talks in “very close” coordination with the United States to ensure Europe’s interests are taken into account. The meeting comes after Macron held key talks with Trump and Zelenskyy on Saturday in Paris.Billions of Russian state funds frozen in the European Union should be used to aid Ukraine, the EU’s top diplomat has said. Kaja Kallas, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs and security, told the Guardian and four other European newspapers that Ukraine had a legitimate claim to compensation and that Russian assets held in the EU were “a tool to pressure Russia”. “Better to have a small bird in your hand than a big bird on the roof,” she said. “So we have the small bird in our hand [the frozen assets] and this is the tool to also pressure Russia.” Her proposal comes amid growing questions over how to fund Ukraine in the medium term and pay its colossal reconstruction bill.

But at a public funeral for Mazen al-Hamadah – before his disappearance in 2020 one of the most vocal survivors of torture in the regime’s prisons system – the joy gave way to sorrow, as the country begins to grapple with the fact that many of the estimated 130,000 people missing may be lost forever.Thousands of people flooded the streets on Thursday, following Hamadah’s body, wrapped in a traditional white shroud, as it was driven slowly from a hospital to the Abdulrahman Abu al Ouf mosque for funeral prayers. At a vigil afterwards in nearby al-Hijaz square, thousands of men, women and children cried and hugged each other, many carrying pictures of their own disappeared loved ones.

For most of this time it is what I thought I wanted, but the closer it gets, the more trepidation I have. I used to put up with behaviours from people that I didn’t really like, but kept relationships going for fear of what would happen if I ended them. I’m not that person any more.I left my husband of 25 years a decade ago and have dropped many friends who I feel no longer give me what I need, who I was “people pleasing” – doing what they wanted to my detriment. I love my partner very much. He is a good, kind, caring man who adores me. But I’m so scared that suddenly I’ll “go off” him like I have other people and that I’ll be stuck living with someone I don’t want to be around. I know I sound dismissive of people. But I have cultivated my own space, my own understanding of my needs and wants. I eventually went off my husband. I don’t want to go off my partner too. How can I be at peace and not be scared of him moving in? It would be positive in so many ways. Continue reading...","Thu, 12 Dec 2024 23:00:29 GMT",0.6956,0.9885

The Guardian,Knitting with dog hair was a craze in the 90s – let’s make it happen again,"Clothes made from a canine you know are much more special than clothes from an anonymous sheepSeveral decades ago, the idea arose of writing a book to examine the ways in which dog hair could be used by knitters. Most people thought the concept was a few puppies short of a litter, if not downright crazy. The exceptions were experienced spinners (for whom dog hair was merely another nifty fiber to experiment with) and people of exceptional vision and imagination (nearly all of whom owned beloved dogs who shed exasperating quantities of fuzz).The project began when I was spinning fluff from Ollie, a Great Pyrenees belonging to my friends Barbara Binswanger and Jim Charlton. Like many spinners, I already knew that dog fuzz could be spun – many books devoted to the craft of spinning carried a paltry brief paragraph on it, but the information was often sketchy and seemed like an afterthought, a footnote to more substantial sections on alpaca, vicuña and other exotic fibers. After collecting Ollie fuzz over time at each dinner date with Barb and Jim, I spent a weekend spinning, which yielded enough yarn to make nothing less than a sweater for Barb and a vest for Jim.

Personally, I don’t get caught up in trends. Or maybe it’s that I’m a bit sceptical of them: if something is good – really good – then it’s timeless. Sure, we all get excited about the next big thing, but I don’t believe something’s value should be determined by how much attention it gets on Instagram or TikTok.But food trends can bring certain ingredients into the spotlight.

Fine, I’m not above a subscription box of IPAs or some nice fineliners, but when it comes to the essentials of life, I buy … the basics. A set of AirPods? You can get a set of Bluetooth headphones for less than £20. Designer glasses? Not when I look so stylish in my nerd-frames. A six-pack of white athletic socks? Yes, please — throw in a pack of plain T-shirts while you’re at it. Continue reading...","Wed, 11 Dec 2024 23:59:02 GMT",0.6597,0.9292
The Guardian,Did gerrymandering keep Republicans from a bigger majority? Absolutely not | David Daley,"Mike Johnson has an explanation for why the Republican majority is so thin – and it’s misleading and cynicalMike Johnson, the House Speaker, will soon have the challenge of leading a three-seat Republican majority. He has an interesting theory about why the Republican edge will be so slender. Last week, on Fox News, he blamed Democratic gerrymandering.While it’s always a delightful surprise to hear a Republican leader express concern about the evils of gerrymandering, Johnson has the facts and the math completely backwards.David Daley is the author of the new book Antidemocratic: Inside the Right’s 50-Year Plot to Control American Elections as well as Ratf**ked: Why Your Vote Doesn’t Count Continue reading...","Thu, 12 Dec 2024 11:00:15 GMT",0.0,0.5574

The Guardian,It’s not bigotry to worry about migration – the latest figures tell a complex story | Larry Elliott,"Large parts of Britain would not function without migrants, but there are consequences for housing, GDP and productivityRecord NHS waiting lists. Flatlining living standards. Rising levels of long-term sickness. The dire state of the public finances. The list of problems inherited from the Conservatives by Keir Starmer is long, but near the top is how to respond to record levels of net migration.According to official estimates released last month, the past three years have seen almost 2.4 million more people arrive in the UK than have left. Over the centuries, inward migration has been a feature of this country’s history, but the speed and scale of the recent increases are new. In the 1960s and 1970s, emigration tended to be higher than immigration and it has only been in the past quarter of a century that net migration began its upward trend. By way of comparison, net migration in the three years leading up the Brexit vote in 2016 stood at 865,000.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Labour and prisons: sustained courage is needed for rational reform,"Circumstances have forced the government into a more rational penal policy but it will take time to show resultsConvicted criminals do not rank high on most voters’ list of candidates for generous government spending. As a result, the prisons budget has historically been a soft political target for cost savings. The people most affected in the short term have little impact on public debate. Prisoners can’t vote. In the longer term derelict, overcrowded jails accelerate recidivism, exacerbate drug and mental health problems and incubate hardcore criminality. That has an impact far beyond prison walls, upsetting a wider swathe of the electorate and placing a heavier burden on the exchequer. Skimping on justice is the definition of a false economy.This is something Sir Keir Starmer, as a former director of public prosecutions, understands. There are encouraging signs that his government is serious about repairing the neglect and wanton damage done in this area by the Conservatives.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on the Murdoch family drama: mogul’s death could imitate art,"Events in a US court reveal a story that rivals HBO’s Succession with a patriarch’s waning control, sibling rivalries and a media empire at stake“All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,” begins Leo Tolstoy’s novel Anna Karenina. This is an appropriate lens to view Rupert Murdoch’s semi-public family feud. This week, it emerged that the media mogul had lost the first round in his legal bid to secure his empire for Lachlan, his eldest son and anointed heir, over his other children – James, Elisabeth and Prudence. More than a power play, it was Murdoch’s final push to secure his rightwing media vision, even at the expense of family unity.The familial strife – driven by blurred lines between business and family, ideological clashes and a patriarch’s weakening grip – exemplifies Tolstoy’s “unique unhappiness”. The Murdochs’ conflicts are shaped by their extraordinary wealth, influence and public scrutiny. The divisions could paralyse corporate decision making, destabilising a media empire with significant repercussions for the culture and politics of the Anglosphere.

The Guardian,Ben Stokes puts Ashes on back burner to focus on England’s here and now,"England captain admits he ‘spoke a little too much’ about Australia showdown instead of New Zealand and India TestsEngland are about to complete their busiest year of Test cricket with Ben Stokes encouraged by the overhaul in personnel that has taken place. Although the captain has a small regret from this period: publicly discussing the next Ashes series.
 The third Test against New Zealand that starts in Hamilton on Saturday (10pm Friday UK) will be England’s 17th in 2024, matching only their fixture list in 2016 by way of volume. That year saw a jaded Alastair Cook quit the captaincy but while Stokes called 2024 “a long, tough slog”, the 33-year-old completes it looking personally rejuvenated.The same goes for a side that finished 2023 with an average age of 32 and has since shaved that figure by nearly five years. The retirements of Jimmy Anderson, Stuart Broad and Moeen Ali – plus the decision to move on from Jonny Bairstow – account for much of this shift, while the subsequent arrivals of Gus Atkinson, Brydon Carse, Jamie Smith and Shoaib Bashir have largely vindicated the policy also.
 Ordering an all-time great such as Anderson to step aside at the start of the summer was not straightforward, however, and took some explaining publicly. And it was here where Stokes found himself using the 2025-26 Ashes – and the likelihood a seamer already in his forties would not make it that far – as the overriding justification.

The Guardian,From exquisite Elgar to razor-sharp Cage: our classical recordings of the year,"A piano prodigy burst onto the scene, studio opera recordings were few and far between – and the year’s most rewarding discs were the ones that ventured beyond the mainstreamMost end-of-year lists will surely be featuring a remarkable young pianist, Yunchan Lim, whose very special talent had first been spotted when he won the 2022 Van Cliburn competition and whose debut studio recording for Decca brilliantly confirmed those first impressions. But the release that heads our top ten was more of a surprise. Vilde Frang had already established herself among the leading violinists of her generation, but even so the sheer excellence of her recording of the Elgar Violin concerto, arguably the best to appear in 40 years, was totally unexpected.Meanwhile, the age of the all-star studio-made opera recording is very much over. DVDs of stage productions now easily outnumber new audio-only opera sets, and this year the highest-profile operatic releases on CD were all sourced from either stage or concert performances: Sony Classical’s Parsifal, with Jonas Kaufmann in the title role, was taken from the Vienna State Opera’s production; LSO Live’s version of Meyerbeer’s Le Prophète, conducted by Mark Elder, came from concert performances at the Aix-en-Provence festival, while the same label’s Janáček series, based on performances under Simon Rattle at the Barbican in London, continued with Kát’a Kabanová. The two outstanding rarities to have come from the ever invaluable BruZane stable this year started life in concert too - Louise Bertin’s fascinating Fausto, and the baritone version of Massenet’s Werther, with Tassis Christoyannis in the title role and Véronique Gens as an exceptional Charlotte.

The Guardian,Is making a holiday wishlist practical or tacky?,"Nearly 5bn lb of gift returns end up in landfills every year and yet there is a certain taboo around compiling a gift listThe first Christmas that I was with my boyfriend, his family asked for my Christmas wishlist. I was unused to the concept, apart from writing to Santa as a kid. Usually, my family’s norm is to haphazardly guess what each person might want – with a pretty conservative success rate, if I’m being honest. So I was surprised by the tradition of requesting and sharing wishlists – and even more surprised by how much I liked it.I’m the kind of gift-giver who keeps an eye out year-round for what people might enjoy, picking things up in advance and delighting them with my acuity and taste. Nonetheless, I don’t find the perfect gift for everyone every single year like clockwork, because I am not superhuman. Ever since adopting the wishlist tradition into my own family I find having gift ideas direct from the people in my life is unbeatably practical, massively stress-reducing and satisfying.

Living in Brooklyn and working as a financial headhunter, she moved into an apartment building with lots of other people her age. “There were 25 apartments in total and a rooftop where we’d go for parties,” she says. “It was like living in the cast of Friends. Everyone knew each other and we were always in and out of each other’s homes.”In the autumn of 1984, one of her neighbours invited her to his family home in New Jersey for Rosh Hashanah, a Jewish new year celebration. As soon as she arrived, she was introduced to his sister, Andrea, a market researcher who also lived in New York. For both of them, the friendship was like “love at first sight”, and they instantly bonded. Continue reading...","Wed, 11 Dec 2024 11:00:45 GMT",0.7717,0.9493

The Guardian,"The cochlear question: as the parent of a deaf baby, should I give her an implant to help her hear?","Cochlear implantation is controversial in ways that parallel medical situations – such as artificial limbs and cornea transplants – are not. Why does this issue provoke such fierce debate?This essay first appeared under the title The Cochlear Question on Aeon.coI knew my daughter could hear: not just because she loved music, but because she had perfect rhythm. She punched her fists in the air like a human metronome, and brought a doughy heel to the ground precisely on each downbeat. I had thrown off the yoke of milestone-tracking months earlier, having become fixated on her inability to roll during the precise developmental week for rolling. So when she didn’t form consonants at the prescribed time, I made a deliberate choice to ignore it. It didn’t occur to me that deafness might not be a binary, and that certain vibrations and pitches – the downbeat of a song by toddler-music group the Wiggles, say – could be apprehended, while other subtle speech sounds might be snatched out of a sentence. So it was a couple of months after her first birthday when we discovered that our Botticellian baby had mild hearing loss, and two years after that when she lost almost all of her remaining hearing entirely.Like most hearing parents of deaf children, my first close relationship with a deaf person was with my child. Despite a relatively broad cultural education, I knew next to nothing about hearing loss or deaf culture. What little I had absorbed was an incomplete and almost entirely inaccurate patchwork of pop culture snippets – the mother’s horror when her baby doesn’t react to the fire engine’s siren in the film Mr Holland’s Opus (1995); Beethoven’s struggle to hear the first performance of his Ninth Symphony; the lift scene in Jerry Maguire (1996) where the loving boyfriend signs “you complete me” to his partner; Quasimodo’s apparent industrial deafness from the bells of Notre-Dame; and, worst of all, the appalling memory of my university housemate imitating a deaf accent for laughs. This bleak landscape of ignorance and misinformation is often the lookout from which parents begin making decisions, as deaf critics have rightly pointed out. But although I began educating myself belatedly, it didn’t take long for the calcified layers of assumptions and approximations to disintegrate. Chief among them was the unquestioned belief that hearing loss, for an early deafened person, is even a loss at all. Continue reading...","Wed, 11 Dec 2024 23:59:02 GMT",0.4019,-0.9734

The Guardian,I was forced to give my baby away – and it was 40 years before I saw him again,"Abused as a child, barely able to support herself as an adult, Maria Arbuckle was one of thousands of unmarried women who suffered in Ireland’s mother and baby homes. She talks about her long battle to be reunited with her son – and the tragedy that struck soon afterWhen Maria Arbuckle thinks of her time in Ireland’s largest mother and baby home, she thinks of the nursery and its snug rows of cots, each one filled with a tiny, bleating bundle. She thinks of her boy, Paul, among them, and the 8lb 10oz weight of him in her arms. She thinks of how she fed and washed him under the careful watch of the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul. And she thinks of the refrain that ended each visit, when she had to&nbsp;hand him back to them: “He’s not yours any more. He doesn’t belong to you.”Arbuckle, 62, was six months pregnant when she was sent by social services in Northern Ireland to Saint Patrick’s mother and baby home over the border in Dublin. She was 18 and emerging from a childhood spent shunted between a children’s home, an abusive foster home and a church-run industrial school for children considered to be in “moral danger”. It was 1981, Northern Ireland was in the thick of the Troubles and she was living in the border county of Monaghan, far from her native Derry. Her first serious relationship had collapsed, she had no contact with the foster family who had raised her for 11 years and she was barely making ends meet with her traineeship with a bookmaker. “At the mother and baby home, they told me that I had nowhere to go,” she recalls, more than four decades later. “I&nbsp;was on my own. I had no man, no&nbsp;family. And they were right.” Continue reading...","Wed, 11 Dec 2024 10:00:44 GMT",-0.4588,-0.9605

The Guardian,‘It’s about total freedom’: Jeff Wall on his photographs of fallen horse riders and flooded graves,"A new exhibition displays 40 years of work by the artist who stages scenes to painstakingly replicate the images in his mind – and some, he says, are definitely easier than othersJeff Wall has long been championed as the master of slow looking. Back in 1985, the year before he turned 40, the British Columbia-born artist received a tip from a close friend. He had, by that point, published landmark scholarly essays, held professorships and made some seminal images, though not that many. His friend had seen a woman fall off her horse, and thought that was something Wall should photograph. “He said: ‘That kind of looked like a subject you could do,’ and I totally disregarded it because I just wasn’t interested at the time. But, two years ago, it came back to me.”Over the past 40 years, Wall has utilised the speed and precision of photography to make exquisite, arresting works based on furtive moments just like this. Ask him how he decides what to shoot and he’ll likely say he’s not sure. Somehow, a vision bubbles up to the surface of his mind. As the viewer, the work he makes in response demands your stillness.
