The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Ukraine dismisses Trump envoy suggestion that both sides will make concessions,"Adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskyy calls Keith Kellogg’s plan a failure after US envoy says he thinks both sides ‘will give a little bit’; British PM says Putin ‘rattled’ by Trump threats. What we know on day 1,076See all our Ukraine war coverageDonald Trump’s Ukraine envoy hinted that both sides would have to make concessions to end the war – which could include Kyiv giving up land occupied by Russia. After recently returning from a visit to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg told Fox News that “both sides will give a little bit”. Zelenskyy “has already indicated he will soften his position on land,” the retired lieutenant general said, adding that Putin “is going to have to soften his positions as well”. But the Ukrainian president’s communications adviser dismissed Kellogg’s intervention. “We haven’t seen Mr Kellogg’s full interview … But if his plan is just a ceasefire and elections, it is a failed plan – Putin won’t be intimidated by just those two things,” Dmytro Lytvyn told journalists.Trump’s threat of sanctions has left Vladimir Putin “rattled” and concerned about the Russian economy, British prime minister Keir Starmer has said ahead of an informal European defence cooperation meeting in Brussels on Monday. Starmer said it was necessary to “see all allies stepping up – particularly in Europe” when it comes to inflicting economic harm on Russia, and argued it would help bring about peace by ending the Ukraine war sooner. “President Trump has threatened more sanctions on Russia and it’s clear that’s got Putin rattled,” Starmer said ahead of the trip. “We know that he’s worried about the state of the Russian economy.”In talks with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, on Sunday Starmer stressed that it was important to ensure Ukraine “was in the strongest possible position in the coming months”, so that any peace deal to end its war with Ukraine “could be achieved through strength.” Starmer will also meet Nato secretary general Mark Rutte on Monday, before travelling to meet the leaders of the 27 EU member states at the informal meeting of the European Council.Kyiv and Moscow traded blame on Sunday for a strike on a school in a Ukrainian-occupied town in Russia’s Kursk region. The Ukrainian air force said four people were killed on Saturday in a Russian guided aerial bomb attack on a former school building sheltering civilians in the town of Sudzha. Four others were seriously wounded and 80 people rescued from the rubble, it added. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called Russia “devoid of civility”, sharing a video on social media showing a heavily damaged building, as well as a wounded man lying on the ground. But Russia blamed Ukraine for the attack, saying they had opened a criminal case against a Ukrainian commander who they said was behind it. A defence ministry statement accused Kyiv of a “war crime” with “no statute of limitations” by targeting the school.Ukrainian prosecutors charged two men on Sunday over the killing of an army draft officer in the central Poltava region, leading a top general to call for swift punishment as he warned of growing disrespect towards members of the military. One of the suspects, who was being driven to a military training centre on Friday with other conscripts, called an acquaintance who then arrived at the scene and shot dead one of the accompanying officers, the Prosecutor General’s office alleged. Two suspects were arrested a few hours later, the office said in a statement, adding that police had seized a hunting rifle, ammunition and two cases of hand grenades from the alleged shooter.Separately, an explosion near a recruitment centre for the Ukrainian military on Sunday wounded one person, police said. Taking place outside an army office in the central town of Pavlograd, Sunday’s blast was the latest in a series of similar incidents, just a day after another blast Rivne, a town in north-west Ukraine, killed one person. Without giving a possible cause, the Dnipropetrovsk regional police said an investigation was ongoing into Sunday’s blast which happened towards at 6.40pm. “According to preliminary information, a man was wounded by the explosion of a unidentified object,” the force said in a statement.A Ukrainian drone attack killed one civilian in the Russian region of Belgorod bordering Ukraine, the regional governor said on Sunday. “A man was killed,” governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said of the overnight strike in a post on the Telegram messaging app. “He died from his injuries before the ambulance crew arrived.” Gladkov said the attack took place in the village of Malinovka about 8km (5 miles) east of the border.

I was just having the time of my life in my early 20s.”Saffrey’s diagnosis came after she experienced symptoms such as extreme fatigue, to the point where she was falling asleep at work, as well as joint pains, headaches, and mouth ulcers. But fortunately, her GP immediately suspected lupus when Saffrey presented those symptoms and she received her diagnosis relatively quickly. “Having been diagnosed, I remember thinking: how is this going to change my life? I was in shock, thinking one minute I’m invisible and the next minute I’m not. I now have this illness, this shadow over me.” Continue reading...","Sun, 02 Feb 2025 14:22:34 GMT",0.296,-0.9153

I blame my Smash Hits-influenced recollections of a more wholesome boyband than most – but still, I question what this documentary could possibly have to expose about them. The pain of performing shirtless, even though you’re still wearing a waistcoat and tie?Very quickly, any scepticism disappears.

But that’s not the only reason we need more peace and quiet in our livesNo dogs barking. No lawnmowers. No revving engines. No sirens or car alarms. No planes. No construction work. No delivery lorries. Just pure, blissful silence. My ears could barely believe what they weren’t hearing when I opened the door, stepped into the garden and listened. It was autumn last year and I had just moved 600 miles north, from south-east England to Abernethy Forest in the Scottish Highlands. Occasionally, the wind shushed through the tree tops, like a slow wave breaking on the shore. Then it was quiet again. I lay in bed that night, letting my ears explore the faint thrum of silence, and for the first time in ages I didn’t reach for my earplugs.In the ensuing months, my ears let go, by degrees, of a tension that I hadn’t been aware I was holding. I almost expected to look in the mirror and find them drooping, like those of a drowsy puppy. “Isn’t it a bit quiet for you there?” people asked – either mystified by our move, or concerned that we wouldn’t hack it.

The Guardian,"As a surgeon in Gaza, I witnessed hell visited on children. It shames me that Britain played a part in it | Nizam Mamode","I saw them killed by sniper fire and drones. Why doesn’t Labour condemn it? Why do arms keep flowing in Israel’s direction?I had never imagined, when working as a professor of transplant surgery at a large teaching hospital in London, that one day I would find myself operating on an eight-year-old child who was bleeding to death, only to be told by the scrub nurse that there were no more gauze swabs available. But I found myself in that situation last August while operating at Nasser hospital in Gaza as a volunteer with Medical Aid for Palestinians (Map). Reduced to scooping out the blood with my hands, I felt an overwhelming wave of nausea – I was anxious that the child would not survive.

The Guardian,Does Labour really think Trump is a better bet than the EU? | William Keegan,"Rachel Reeves is all for growth; her party and the country needs it. But still we hear nothing about the most obvious solution…In 1935, Sinclair Lewis wrote a satirical book, It Can’t Happen Here, about a lying demagogue, Buzz Windrip, who rises to power and transforms the American scene for the worse within months.There were fears of parallels with the plot of the book when Trump first became president. This time, the fears are far more serious, as Trump’s barrage of executive orders challenges the constitutional checks and balances designed by the founding fathers to inhibit the autocratic desires of a future wrong’un becoming president.

The Guardian,Why do we go to coffee shops? It’s not just for the hot drinks | Emma Beddington,"Starbucks wants people to stop hanging out in its US branches without buying anything. But sometimes we all need somewhere to sit that isn’t homeThere has been a kerfuffle about cafes recently. In the US, Starbucks’ new “Coffeehouse Code of Conduct” is making people buy something or leave, reversing its previous laid-back attitude. Meanwhile, in Paris, cultural barricades are being raised between trad cafes and the kind that sell €5 almond milk cortados. The New York Times last month set out the “zinc bar v barista” philosophical divide between classic community hubs and hipster roasteries in the city, while a Parisienne on TikTok has posted a video pointing out three new-gen coffee shops within 50 metres of each other in the Marais, explaining that French people “take our time to have a coffee … we sit on a terrace”, but now “les Américains” are demanding takeaway americanos.This is about what cafes are for – and the answer has always been more than coffee. Seventeenth-century coffee houses offered a democratic meeting space (well, unless you were a woman). Revolution brewed in US and French ones in the 18th century. They were also, historically, a refuge. In one of her memoirs, Simone de Beauvoir described spending whole days in the Café de Flore through the freezing winter of 1942-43, arriving early to get the hottest spot, next to the stovepipe. “We always had a shock of pleasure, emerging from the cold darkness, coming into this warm, bright den,” she wrote. She and others who did the same became a&nbsp;“family” of regulars. “We felt at home, safe.” Continue reading...","Sun, 02 Feb 2025 14:00:13 GMT",0.0,0.8857
The Guardian,Airport expansion puts the government on the flight path to years of trouble and strife,"On top of the added levels of noise and air pollution, there’s the non-trivial matter of demolishing hundreds of homes, diverting several waterways and rerouting a long stretch of the M25Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has illuminated the “fasten seat belts” sign. Not only have Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves run into severe turbulence over Heathrow, the flight deck deliberately steered the Labour plane into storm clouds. That’s an interesting choice for a government that was already buffeted by serious unpopularity and it’s a choice that a lot of their own party are struggling to explain to themselves. Anger about the chancellor’s new commitment to back the expansion of the London airport and others is mingled with bewilderment. A lot of Labour people are scratching their heads trying to work out why she wants to burn political capital on a hugely contentious project that couldn’t possibly be complete until long after she’s done at the Treasury and Sir Keir is gone from Number&nbsp;10.It was her choice and his. She didn’t have to make airport expansion the centrepiece of her keynote speech about growth. The prime minister, if his title means anything, could have stopped his chancellor had he wanted to. One consequence of the fury about the subject&nbsp;is that it diverts attention from her more welcome&nbsp;thoughts about how to boost Britain’s growth-starved economy.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Star Wars II: US plans for missile shield risk nuclear instability | Editorial,"Donald Trump’s initiative echoes past mistakes and could provoke adversaries and undermine efforts toward nuclear diplomacyWith a stroke of his pen, Donald Trump last week ordered an “iron dome for America” – an act that risks sparking a destabilising global arms race. Mr Trump’s proposal takes its name from Israel’s air defence system, but it is cast in more ambitious terms for the US: a space-based interception system designed to counter nuclear, hypersonic and cruise missile threats.It is also the latest turn of the wheel in a cycle of escalation. Moves by Washington to “increase security” have repeatedly ended up making the world more volatile and unsafe. The historic chance to eliminate nuclear weapons in 1986 slipped away over Ronald Reagan’s insistence on America’s unproven “Star Wars” missile defence system. In 2002, George&nbsp;W&nbsp;Bush – citing the threat from North Korea – ditched the anti-ballistic missile treaty, which was built on the idea that mutual vulnerability cools the nuclear arms race while unchecked defences fuel it. In The New Nuclear Age, Ankit Panda points out that Russia and China responded with countermeasures to ensure “their nuclear forces would have the ability to penetrate a sophisticated US system”.

The Guardian,"The Guardian view on women’s unpaid labour: attitudes have shifted, but the burden hasn’t | Editorial","The Wages for Housework campaign asked a provocative question. More than 50 years later, it is still relevantIn 1987, just under half the population – 48% – still believed that a man’s main job was to earn money, and a woman’s to look after the home, according to the British Social Attitudes survey. By 2022 that had plummeted to 9%. Yet while the proportion of women in full-time jobs has soared, the burden of domestic labour still falls unfairly on their shoulders in&nbsp;heterosexual households – whereas same-sex couples tend to divide it more equally. Men are doing more than they did, but women still do most – even when they are the main breadwinners, US research has&nbsp;shown. Beliefs have been transformed, but behaviour has proved more stubborn.Globally, the UN has reported that women do at least two-and-a-half times more household and care work than men, equivalent to 10%-39% of the gross domestic product of member states. In the US, analysis suggests that women – who make up half of the paid workforce – account for almost 80% of the unpaid domestic work: worth around $3.6tn a year. Yet this labour is not included in GDP and in many countries is ignored or insufficiently recognised when it comes to divorce. Continue reading...","Sun, 02 Feb 2025 17:25:16 GMT",-0.5927,-0.251

And Rob Harris doesn’t want to see capital gains tax applied to his homeGeorge Monbiot (Home truths: the only thing Labour is building is a bigger, more dysfunctional housing market, 26 January) hits several nails on the head, but the most pivotal is his hunch that ministers “are intelligent people pretending not to be for political reasons”.In a housing market bloated by financialisation after a decade and a half of interest rates close to zero, ownership prospects have been increasingly confined to those inheriting property wealth, and the only way that will change within the mortgageable years of the current unendowed cohort will be through the puncturing of this Ponzi scheme by government intervention.

The Guardian,Men concerned about prostate cancer should think before asking for a PSA test | Letter,"Retired urologist Reginald Hall says men should consider the evidence before asking their GP for the screening testYour article quotes Prostate Cancer UK’s director of health services saying: “More men than ever are learning about their risk, speaking to their GP about the PSA [prostate specific antigen] blood test, and then taking the best next steps” (Prostate cancer becomes most common cancer diagnosis in England, 28 January). However, men should think very carefully and consider the evidence before asking their GP for a PSA test.In 2018, a review of the available evidence concluded that 1,000 men would have to be PSA-screened to prevent one man from dying of prostate cancer over 10 years, and screening probably did not improve men’s chances of being alive after 10 years. In 2019, a review of the results of the European Randomised study of Screening for Prostate Cancer reported that, after 16 years, 570 men had to be invited for screening to prevent one prostate cancer death. The results of these scientific studies are the reason why the UK does not have a prostate screening programme. Continue reading...","Sun, 02 Feb 2025 16:45:57 GMT",-0.6597,-0.9763

First my sister and I went to the Marcus Garvey Saturday school in Hammersmith. Later we went to the Saturday school in Acton, organised by Mr Carter. He was a light-skinned Black man with slightly ginger hair and freckles, bearing a strange resemblance to Jimmy Carter, who was the president of the United States.The sole purpose of the Saturday school was to help Black children who were underachieving or being failed by the education system. At that time, I didn’t know that these facilities were organised throughout the United Kingdom by Black parents, teachers and academics. In 1971, a London schoolteacher, Bernard Coard, wrote a pamphlet called How the West Indian Child is Made Educationally Subnormal in the British School System: The Scandal of the Black Child in Schools in Britain. Although there had been efforts to support Black children prior to this, this was the launching pad for a nationwide and organised act of self-determination.

The Guardian,Curtain up! Meet the new artistic directors with great plans for British theatre,"Our ​theatre critic welcomes inspiring developments at stages across the UK,​ from the Young Vic to the Liverpool Everyman while, below, some of the top new recruits talk about working post-pandemic in an era of funding cuts – and share the secrets of their tradeIt happens every few years. An artistic director leaves a theatre; another steps up or down or sideways to take the position; a third follows. Within months a sweeping change has occurred and the theatrical landscape looks entirely different.After the last spin of the wheel in 2019 the crucial changes were immediately evident. They marked the beginning of the end of a particular hegemony: that of the white British male. This time the alterations are inspiriting in a different way. The talent and the zeal, the raring-to-go of the directors taking up new positions, have survived one of the bleakest of arts eras. In lockdown the stage was shredded: the National Theatre in London was wrapped up in barrier tape saying “Missing Live Theatre”; freelance performers, designers and directors were stripped of all income, often forced to leave their professions. In the social distancing that followed, auditoriums looked like crime scenes, with seats sealed off. Continue reading...","Sun, 02 Feb 2025 10:00:07 GMT",0.6588,0.8625
The Guardian,I’ll Never Call Him Dad Again by Caroline Darian review – resilience and bravery in a book by the daughter of Gisèle Pelicot,"In this forceful and lucid memoir the author details the impact of her father’s crimes on the family and her decision to never forgive or forget“I was sacrificed on the altar of vice,” said Gisèle Pelicot in her opening testimony of a trial that shook France and the world between September and December 2024. Waiving her right to anonymity, the 72-year-old made her ordeal public so that, in her words, “shame must change sides”. For nearly 10 years, her husband of 50 years Dominique had invited dozens of men via an online site (now closed) to rape her while she lay comatose in bed in their home near Avignon. Each time, he had sedated her with a mix of anti-anxiety drugs and sleeping pills slipped into her food and glasses of wine. He filmed the rapes and stored the videos neatly in his computer under the title “abuse”.Dominique Pelicot may never have been arrested had it not been for the perseverance of supermarket security guards who noticed him making upskirt videos of female shoppers. They convinced three of them to file a complaint to the police in September 2020. A young police officer then seized Pelicot’s computer and electronic equipment to investigate further. Police technicians unearthed more than 20,000 pornographic videos and pictures documenting his crimes against his wife. In just a few weeks, the police established that Gisèle Pelicot had been raped at least 200 times, the equivalent of once a fortnight for almost 10 years. Convinced that she was in mortal danger because of the repeated sedation, they worked night and day until they could gather enough evidence and arrest Dominique Pelicot. On 2 November 2020, Gisèle accompanied her husband to the police station in Carpentras, near where they lived. He had admitted to upskirting and had cried for her forgiveness. While police officers dealt with her husband (he would never walk free again), Gisèle Pelicot was invited into a room by the young investigative officer, who started revealing the torture she had endured unknowingly. She now understood why she had suffered from severe memory losses, fainting and gynaecological problemss. She did not have Alzheimer’s, as she had feared.

The Guardian,"Ballerina Lauren Cuthbertson: ‘There’s a saying that dancers die twice, the first time when they stop dancing’","The Royal Ballet principal on her late career debut, taking her daughters to work, and playing goodies and baddiesBorn in Devon in 1984, Lauren Cuthbertson joined the Royal Ballet School aged 11 and the Royal Ballet in 2002, becoming a principal six years later. She has danced leading roles in all the great classical ballets including Swan Lake and The Sleeping Beauty, has performed in works by Kenneth MacMillan and Frederick Ashton, and created many new ballets, particularly those by Christopher Wheeldon, who cast her as Alice in his three-act Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and as Hermione in The Winter’s Tale. She has recently become principal guest artist at the Royal Ballet and is taking a teaching diploma. She lives in west London with her boyfriend and their two daughters, aged four and two.You’re about to make your debut as Tatiana in John Cranko’s Onegin, based on Pushkin’s classic verse-novel. How are you feeling?It’s a funny sensation making such a significant debut so late in my career: it made me feel quite vulnerable, but also it was very thrilling. It’s been a lovely journey but it’s surprisingly physical. I did my first run through on stage at an 11am rehearsal and when I went to tear up Onegin’s letter at the end [as Tatiana sends him away], I had no strength in my arms. I hadn’t anticipated that. Mind you, an early call is always weird – it’s hard to eat properly. You might have a bit of breakfast, but suddenly you finish the rehearsal, and it’s 2pm. You can’t eat a sandwich in the middle of a three-act ballet. Continue reading...","Sun, 02 Feb 2025 09:30:08 GMT",-0.7269,0.9246
The Guardian,Rob Auton: The Eyes Open and Shut Show review – eccentric observation and wonderment,"Soho theatre, LondonThe Yorkshireman’s half-banal half-profound ruminations on the subject of sight won me overA career that might be more successful if only he could describe to people what he’s actually doing. That’s how Rob Auton describes his life’s work – half- (or less) jokingly – in his new hour The Eyes Open and Shut Show. So what is he doing? At points tonight, the Yorkshireman self-identifies as a comedian, and as a poet. You might throw in philosopher too, or indeed aphorist – with reference to the pithy principles Auton hews from his inquiry into life and how to live it, and which, fashioned into homespun artworks, he touts as merch at the end of the show.If that sounds like a commercial instinct at play – well, I think the 42-year-old can be forgiven a rearguard effort to make his eccentric brand of performance pay. Tonight’s set takes as its soft focus the subject of eyes. What’s the difference between whale-watching and whale-seeing? If we sneezed with our eyes open, would they pop out of our head? And “can you imagine if you loved blinking?” Auton worries away at these half-banal, half-profound inquiries, sends up his own kooky interest in them, and gets meta on the jokes he constructs thereof. The upshot is a meandering monologue piloted by Auton’s curiosity about graveyards, the teachings of Eckhart Tolle, or the key to Mick Jagger’s success.

The Guardian,You’re Cordially Invited review – Will Ferrell and Reese Witherspoon are the draw in wildly uneven wedding comedy,"Two weddings, one double booking and a series of cliches are the order of the day in Nicholas Stoller’s Bride Wars-lite comedyAny film combining the comedy talents of Will Ferrell and Reese Witherspoon is unlikely to be entirely terrible. That said, the wildly uneven wedding clash comedy You’re Cordially Invited is certainly in the vicinity of terrible on numerous occasions. Ferrell plays Jim, the smothering, widowed dad of Jenni (Geraldine Viswanathan); Witherspoon is Margot, the overprotective older sister of Neve, played by Meredith Hagner. When, due to an administrative snafu, Jenni’s and Neve’s weddings are double booked at the same venue, Jim and Margot are determined that their loved ones will still get their day to remember, no matter the cost to the rival party or to personal dignity. Wedding catastrophe cliches abound (cakes, hair and frocks take the brunt of the physical comedy). Ferrell’s crocodile wrestling scene notwithstanding, this just feels like a Bride Wars rip-off without the bite.On Amazon Prime Video Continue reading...","Sun, 02 Feb 2025 12:00:10 GMT",0.3612,0.8494

It means January is over, which is cause for celebration already. The end-of-season sale rails have gone, so shop windows are again a source of new ideas. The weather is still rubbish, obviously, but the light is coming back: with a pinch of luck, you may even see daylight on the way home from the office by the end of February. The first snowdrops are nearly here. I like Valentine’s Day, which I know is deeply uncool of me, but I like pink and I like chocolate, so what’s not to love?But February can be a challenge to dress for.

Please keep reading for a puffer coat update and a fresh layering formula, not to mention a top-tier edit of the most delectable and affordable treats I’ve scouted from February’s shelves.

The Guardian,The food filter: which supermarket has the best extra-virgin olive oil?,"From luxury Sicilian to budget buys, our Rome correspondent tests supermarket extra-virgin olive oils – and reveals how much you should spend• The best hot sauces, tasted and rated by Thomasina MiersYears ago, a good cook, who happened to be Greek, told me to think of olive oil not simply as liquid fat, but as an essential ingredient, as flavour and as a seasoning, with the ability to act like herbs and spices. He’s absolutely right and his excellent advice continues to motivate me when I’m choosing extra-virgin olive oil, which is the single most important ingredient I buy, and my biggest expense in the kitchen. While I do have the odd special bottle for drizzling, I am more interested in a good-tasting all-rounder that I can use for everything (my cooking is largely vegetable-, pasta-, pulse-, cheese- and egg-centric), including deep-frying (in a very small pan).Just to recap, olive oil is the liquid fat obtained by pressing olives, which are fruits. Once picked, they need to be processed as soon as possible – that is, crushed, then centrifugally spun to separate the pulp, water and oil, all in scrupulously clean machinery and at a steady temperature, which preserves the natural aromas of the olives. It takes about eight kilos of olives to make a litre of oil, which, to be considered extra-virgin olive oil, needs to have no defects and no more than 0.8% of free fatty acids. And that comes at a price: expect to pay between £14 and £18 a litre. Continue reading...","Sat, 01 Feb 2025 10:00:39 GMT",0.6369,0.9847

But the restaurant is more than that. Much like Arabic Flavour in Aberystwyth, which I visited last year, it is both the story of exile and an act of memory.

The Guardian,‘Female narcissism is often misdiagnosed’: how science is finding women can have a dark streak too,"Research into ‘dark personality traits’ has always focused on men. But some experts believe standard testing misses the ways an antisocial personality manifests itself in womenPicture a psychopath. Who do you see in your mind’s eye? Chances are it’s a man. And chances are your answer would be similar if you were asked to picture a narcissist. From Charles Manson and Ted Bundy to Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler and Donald Trump, most famous people we consider psychopathic or narcissistic are male. That’s even the case for fiction – think Hannibal Lecter, Patrick Bateman or Norman Bates.Scientists long assumed that women were simply too wonderful to be significantly psychopathic or narcissistic, and didn’t bother to study the possibility much, according to Ava Green from City St George’s, University of London. But research over the past few decades is increasingly challenging this stereotype, suggesting women can have a dark streak, too. Much like in autism or ADHD, such traits just express themselves slightly differently in women – making them harder to spot with diagnostic tests that were essentially developed for men.
