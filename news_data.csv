The social worker knocks on a door and announces her arrival, moves into a tiny entranceway and past the tiled kitchenette from where an elderly lady waves, and into a skinny hall lined with what look like plywood cupboards. They are in fact individual units, Hong Kong’s infamous “coffin homes”, housing dozens of tenants in spaces not much larger than a single bed, stacked two high to the ceiling.Sze, the deputy director of civil rights group the Society for Community Organization (Soco), taps on a couple of the doors, a pile of paper topped with a hastily sketched map of residents scrunched in her other hand.

The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskyy hopes Trump’s ‘unpredictability’ can end war with Russia,"Ukrainian leader has sought to build bridges with Trump amid fears the president-elect could slow vital military aid once in office. What we know on day 1,045See all our Ukraine coverageUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed hope that US president-elect Donald Trump’s “unpredictability” can help end the war with Russia. Trump, who takes office on 20 January, has said he will end the nearly three-year conflict in “24 hours” once in power, a claim that has drawn scepticism from Kyiv, which fears it will be forced to give up land for peace. “He’s very strong and unpredictable, and I would really like to see President Trump’s unpredictability apply to Russia. I believe he really wants to end the war,” Zelensky said in an interview aired on Thursday with Ukrainian TV.The Ukrainian leader has sought to build bridges with Trump and his team since November’s election amid fears the Republican could slow vital US military aid or halt it entirely. Zelenskyy said that Trump could be “decisive” in the war. “He is capable of stopping Putin or, to put it more fairly, help us stop Putin,” he said, “He is able to do this.” Zelenskyy has said that achieving a just peace for Ukraine would mean receiving solid security guarantees from its allies, joining the EU and receiving an invitation to join the Nato alliance, a notion rejected by Moscow.The Ukrainian military said that it had carried out a high-precision strike on Thursday on a Russian command post in Maryino, in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces hold chunks of territory after a major incursion. Ukrainian forces remain in the Kursk region five months after sending troops across the border, though the Russian military says much of the lost territory has been recaptured. “These strikes disrupt the ability of the Russian Federation to conduct terrorism against innocent Ukrainian civilians,” the Ukrainian military said in a statement via the Telegram messaging app. The Russian military said air defence units had downed four Ukrainian missiles in the region, and the regional governor said the strikes had damaged a high-rise apartment building and other buildings in an adjacent village.Ukraine has opened a criminal probe into desertion and “abuse of power” after hundreds of soldiers were reported to have fled an army unit partly trained by France, investigators said Thursday. The 155th Mechanised Brigade, dubbed “Anne of Kyiv”, was one of several military groupings formed last year as Ukraine sought to boost preparations for possible new Russian offensives. The unit was to be made up of 4,500 soldiers, with France training roughly half of them and providing equipment. But its development has been beset with problems including what one lawmaker described as poor management.Gas supplies in Europe were stable with the exception of Moldova, the EU said on Thursday, a day after Russian gas transit via Ukraine stopped. Deliveries of Russian gas to Europe via Ukraine pipelines stopped on Wednesday, after Kyiv refused to renew a decades-long arrangement that earned billions of dollars for both countries. Although Russian gas accounted for less than 10 percent of the European Union’s gas imports in 2023 – down from more than 40 percent before Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in 2022 – some of the bloc’s eastern members are still heavily reliant on Russian imports. “The situation is stable with all member States using a mix of regular winter storage and imports from third countries, which provide stable supplies to their consumers”, said Poland, which has just assumed the EU’s rotating presidency.The cut-off of Russian gas supplies to Moldova’s breakaway Transniestria region, however, has forced the closure of all industrial companies except food producers. The mainly Russian-speaking territory of about 450,000 people, which split from Moldova in the 1990s as the Soviet Union collapsed, has suffered a painful and immediate hit from Wednesday’s cut-off of Russian gas supplies to central and eastern Europe via Ukraine. “All industrial enterprises are idle, with the exception of those engaged in food production – that is, directly ensuring food security for Transdniestria,” Sergei Obolonik, first deputy prime minister of the region, told a local news channel. “The problem is so extensive that if it is not resolved for a long time, we will already have irreversible changes – that is, enterprises will lose their ability to start up.” Continue reading...","Fri, 03 Jan 2025 01:10:24 GMT",-0.7184,-0.9595

The Guardian,Lockerbie: A Search for Truth review – Colin Firth’s disaster drama is worryingly close to a Casualty episode,"This dramatisation about a bereaved father’s heroic hunt for truth gets far too bogged down in detail – and fails to spark any emotion at allThere have been several documentaries about the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, most of them very good: sober, un-sensationalist but deeply moving. It remains the deadliest terrorist attack in UK history. A bomb exploded on Pan Am flight 103 as it flew over the small Scottish town. All 243 passengers and 16 crew were killed. Eleven people were killed on the ground by the debris that suddenly fell out of the night sky.Lockerbie: A Search for Truth dramatises the story of one bereaved father’s efforts to uncover what actually happened – how the bomb got on board the flight, who put it there, which organisation was behind it, and why the UK government seemed to be obstructing his pursuit at every turn. Jim Swire (here played by Colin Firth) was a GP living with his wife, Jane, and their children in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, when the flight exploded with his about-to-be-24-year-old daughter Flora onboard. The drama is based on the book Swire co-wrote with Peter Biddulph, The Lockerbie Bombing: A Father’s Search for Justice, which is the distillation of the years of investigation and involvement he had with the case, including the eventual trial of two Libyan suspects and Swire’s work thereafter to convince the courts and the public that the one convicted man, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi (played by Ardalan Esmaili), was innocent of the crime.

The Guardian,Canceling the apocalypse? What can we learn from films set in 2025,"From monsters fighting robots to a grim look at a decaying healthcare system, past movies set in this new year offer a mixed outlook on what’s to comeThe year 2025: It certainly has that futuristic ring, doesn’t it? Not round enough to come across overly tidy, not odd enough to appear chosen at random, 2025 sounds like a clear interval: a turning point, a historical marker or possibly a deadline. It could well turn out to be any or all of those things, though the outlook feels less futuristically ambiguous than anti-futuristically bleak at the moment.Is there a chance that humanity can back away from frighteningly destructive and relentless wars, rollbacks of human rights, and insistence on having some kind of debate about what kind of medical care works (vaccines) and doesn’t (denying people medical coverage)? It seems unlikely, and even the oddball soothsayers of cinema have a little trouble with this question, because for whatever reason the movies with major events keyed to 2025 have a secondhand quality, whether that’s in megabudget blockbusters of recent history or energetic schlock from earlier on. (Anyway, there’s less difference between the two than the blockbuster-makers would have you believe.) Let’s take a look at the citizens of cinema’s 2025 and see what lessons we might be able to extract from them. Continue reading...","Thu, 02 Jan 2025 14:18:29 GMT",0.0,-0.7848

The Guardian,Ridley Scott is a genius film-maker who can do anything – even start a political crisis in Malta,"It wouldn’t be a press tour without the Gladiator II director saying something contentious, and now he’s managed to upset big cheeses on the Mediterranean islandFor a while, it looked as if Ridley Scott was going to get through the Gladiator II press cycle without saying anything remotely contentious. That was a worry since, as we know, saying contentious things is the entire point of a Ridley Scott press cycle. The gold standard, of course, was Napoleon; a film about a historical French figure that he promoted by slagging off French people (they “don’t even like themselves”) and historians (“Excuse me, mate, were you there? No? Well, shut the fuck up then”). However, the most he managed for Gladiator II was a half-hearted potshot at Russell Crowe’s “bitching”. Slim pickings indeed.But now that awards season is cranking up again, Scott gets a second bite at the cherry. And so last month, during a discussion with Christopher Nolan, he decided to throw Malta into a minor political crisis. The country’s film commissioner Johann Grech shared a clip of the chat on social media, in which Scott made this tourist-friendly pronouncement: “Malta is a treasure trove of architecture. The architecture goes from medieval right through to Renaissance and when it’s good it’s spectacular.” Continue reading...","Thu, 02 Jan 2025 12:19:02 GMT",-0.6249,-0.7149

 As a kid, I did a lot of gymnastics and dance. That sort of physical movement is something I really enjoy, especially when you can apply that foundation into something like this [Kraven the Hunter], where there’s a lot of action and stunts. We wanted Kraven to have a signature style that was kind of animalistic, with a bit of fluidity. So we did a lot of things like quadrupeds (going on all fours), parkour, gymnastics, so it was like nothing you’d ever seen before. It was exciting to have that level of detail within the action.

The Confederation of British Industry reports its members are planning to cut hiring and output in the first three months of 2025. And the Bank of England has held back from another interest rate cut, forecasting higher inflation and stagnant growth in the coming year.Yet these are all very short-term indicators. In recent years, the need for governments to focus on immediate crises (Brexit, Covid, inflation, Liz Truss) has allowed us to forget that longer-term economic policies are also possible. But look behind the headlines, and it’s clear that Labour is trying to address some of Britain’s deep economic problems.Michael Jacobs is professor of political economy at the University of Sheffield and a visiting senior fellow at the thinktank ODI Global Continue reading...","Thu, 02 Jan 2025 14:00:27 GMT",0.0,0.6061
The Guardian,I thought I could be a ‘cool mum’ – just strap my baby to me and keep living life as usual. I was so wrong | Tara Kenny,"I’ve discovered new ways to be cool: rhyme time is my cocktail hour, the park my catwalk and I have a nappy bag that’s chicer than a Fendi BaguetteWhen I was six months pregnant, against all odds, I hosted a house party. An intense plus-one, herself a mother, cornered me to deliver an ominous, drunken warning: “You can’t be cool and be a mum.” This struck me as something that someone who had never been cool, with or without children, would say.Don’t blame your innocent spawn for your lack of rizz, I thought ruefully. Plus, I knew it wasn’t true, because I had grown up idolising my primary school friends’ chic and powerful mothers. They had covetable wardrobes, rock dog exes and misspent youths in far-flung locales such as Prague and Berlin. While we played in the courtyards of their St Kilda apartments, enjoying a luxuriously long leash, they smoked cigarettes and gossiped, unburdened by anxieties about their capacity to measure up to arbitrary standards of coolness.

The Guardian,Emmanuel Macron was the great liberal hope for France and Europe. How did it all go so wrong? | Oliver Haynes,"The French president’s failures offer an object lesson in what happens when liberalism is stripped of its morality and valuesWhen Emmanuel Macron was first elected in the spring of 2017, we were told that he was the future of liberal pluralism. The BBC said his victory was “a repudiation of the populist, antiestablishment wave” of that time. He was “the next leader of Europe” according to a Time Magazine cover. The Economist went one further. Its cover asked if he was Europe’s “saviour” and declared that he was mounting a revolution in democratic politics “without pike or pitchfork”.Seven years later, and Macron’s “peaceful”, “democratic” “revolution” is in ruins, as the president struggles to navigate a political crisis of his own making. In June, he called legislative elections that were unnecessary, lost them, and refused to concede defeat. Over the summer, France went through the second-longest period without a government in its recent history. The resulting Michel Barnier-led government was only able to survive for as long as it did thanks to a compact with the far right, before it crumbled after a vote of no confidence held on 4 December. Although Macron has now named François Bayrou as prime minister, it is unclear how this solves the fundamental problem that both the president and his agenda are widely hated in the country, and broadly opposed in the parliament.Oliver Haynes is a journalist and the co-host of the Flep24 podcast Continue reading...","Thu, 02 Jan 2025 10:00:39 GMT",0.4604,-0.9775
The Guardian,"We can tell the truth about pregnancy without scaring women to death – in fact, it’s vital that we do | Emily Oster","Many women have no idea about the potential complications until they happen. Without discussion there is no treatment or preventionThere is an inherent tension between two basic facts about childbirth. On the one hand, it has happened billions and billions of times in the course of human history and it has been successful in a wide range of settings, from neolithic caves to state-of-the-art hospitals. On the other, it is objectively dangerous in many cases.This tension can be felt in much of the modern popular discourse on birth. On my Instagram feed, there are depictions of unmedicated home births in a bathtub surrounded by flowers and a caption about how birth has got too medicalised. Some commenters are quick to note that, in their case, having that medical help was life-saving. To put it most starkly: yes, people have been giving birth at home for millions of years, but a lot of them died. Continue reading...","Thu, 02 Jan 2025 12:00:46 GMT",0.2514,0.525
The Guardian,Early phase-out of full hybrid vehicles may be a political risk too far for UK ministers | Nils Pratley,"Pragmatism will win over purism, unless the government favours early closure for car manufacturersThe main timetable is set: no new petrol and diesel cars will be allowed to be sold in the UK after 2030, and sales of all new hybrids will be forbidden from 2035. But that phasing still leaves open the critical matter – for the automotive industry, and for a couple of manufacturers in particular – of which new hybrids will be allowed to be sold until the last day of 2034.Just the variety that comes with a socket – plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)? Or should old-style hybrids, such as the Toyota Prius, which have smaller batteries charged by a main internal combustion engine, also be permitted?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on the New Orleans attack: a familiar horror marks an anxious new year | Editorial,"The deadly assault on crowds in the US city echoes those elsewhere. A bigoted and kneejerk reaction will not dispel the threat from terrorismThe deadly attack on new year revellers in New Orleans, which killed at least 15 people and injured dozens more, was all the more terrible for its familiar characteristics. The method of attack – ploughing a vehicle into crowds – and the decision to strike those celebrating at a time associated with togetherness and joy are now far too well recognised internationally. It is less than a fortnight since a man used a car to kill at least five, including a nine-year-old child, at a Christmas market near Magdeburg in Germany.Part of the grimness of this event is that ordinary activities that should require no special protections are now guarded as a matter of course – and that even such precautions can prove inadequate. Bollards were reportedly being upgraded in New Orleans ahead of next month’s Super Bowl, and patrols and barricades were being used in the meantime. In Magdeburg, the perpetrator used an entrance for emergency vehicles.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on the Blair-era archives: fateful decisions come in many guises | Editorial,"Document releases from 2004 show that the Labour cabinet was deeply divided and badly informed on how to handle migration from EuropeJudgments about Tony Blair’s Labour government tend inevitably to focus on the Iraq war. Iraq was traumatic and defining. Britain’s role, driven by Mr Blair, exposed his overly personal system of decision-making. The invasion was a historic and bloody failure, killing hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and sowing dragon’s teeth. At home, the war devastated Mr Blair’s reputation and drained support from Labour.The publication this week by the National Archives of Blair government papers under the 20-year rule does nothing to undermine Iraq’s importance in the history of that period. We read, for instance, of the US deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage complaining that President George Bush thought he was “on some sort of mission from God” in Iraq, and that Mr Blair needed to give the president “a dose of reality”. But by then, tragically, the damage was long done.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Second, long waiting times this year, compared with a similar period in 2009, for diagnostic scans and elective care, and in A&amp;E.My concern is not that the NHS is paralysed while waiting for the 10-year plan, but that its intentions have been overtaken by the package of NHS reforms of zero tolerance for failure announced on 13 November by the Department of Health and Social Care. That package looks like the regimes of the 2000s: sacking persistently failing managers, sending turnaround teams into struggling hospitals, rewarding the best performers with autonomy, and aiming to reduce waiting times from 18 months to 18 weeks.

The Guardian,Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend,"Antonee Robinson is running rampant while Eberechi Eze and Erling Haaland hope to build on goals from last time outThe contrast is significant. Newcastle arrive on the back of four league wins and four clean sheets. Tottenham have one victory in their last seven league games, four goals conceded against Chelsea before being hit for six by a rampaging Liverpool side. Spurs have had little trouble going forward but there remains a concern with the returns from their captain, Son Heung-min. The South Korean has had a quiet season by his excellent standards, seven goals in all competitions thus far, an eighth denied by a miss from the penalty spot against Wolves. Hamstring troubles hampered him earlier in the season and, amid Spurs’ wider difficulties, there is the subplot of a change in status within their attack. Dejan Kulusevski has become the central figure; Brennan Johnson, out on the right, is Spurs’ leading goalscorer across all competitions; Dominic Solanke is steadily finding his way.

The Guardian,Ethel Cain: Perverts review – pink noise and punishment as cult star heads underground,"(Daughters of Cain)Having struggled with the obsessive fandom drawn to her widescreen pop-Americana, Cain returns with 90 minutes of collapsing songs and confrontational power electronicsIn 2023, the Guardian interviewed Hayden Anhedönia, who records as Ethel Cain. She was, in theory, riding high on the critical success of her self-released debut album, Preacher’s Daughter, and the cult following that sprung up in its wake, entranced by its macabre lyrics, drifting, gothy sound – Lana Del Rey if she had ameliorated her latest bad-boyfriend woes by listening to the Cocteau Twins and sundry shoegazing bands – and Anhedönia’s strikingly unfiltered image. A sometime model, she has the names of both the angel Gabriel and a demon from various apocryphal Jewish and Islamic texts tattooed across her forehead, has talked openly about being trans and autistic, and is given to hair-raising social media posts in which she has variously called for the assassination of Joe Biden, armed insurrection in America and, most recently, the release of Luigi Mangione, the chief suspect in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.And yet, Anhedönia did not seem to be riding high in 2023. She protested at length about both the scale of her success, her popularity on social media and the intrusive nature of her most obsessive fans: complaints we’ve heard again and again from female artists including Mitski and Chappell Roan. She talked about wishing she “had a much smaller fanbase” and wasn’t viewed as a pop star, even an alt-pop star. Continue reading...","Thu, 02 Jan 2025 12:00:47 GMT",-0.7906,-0.9465

But this is Plexus Polaire, a French-Norwegian company that specialises in puppet theatre, and these players are just wood, foam and papier-mache. Yet their eerie fascination feels no less potent offstage than on, in the large-scale production of Moby Dick by the company’s founder and director, Yngvild Aspeli, based on Herman Melville’s novel.“Puppetry is like a ouija board,” she tells me later, on a video call from the arctic village of Stamsund, Norway, where she also directs Nordland Visual Theatre. “Even if you know someone is moving the glass, you still have that doubt: maybe it is moving by itself.

The Guardian,How to have a perfectly imperfect 2025 – podcast,"Instead of making grand new year’s resolutions, the smallest steps could lead to a more joyful life, says Oliver BurkemanWriter Oliver Burkeman was once a master of procrastination. Many years ago Helen Pidd worked at the desk opposite him and would watch him spend the day doing anything but writing, until, with a few hours to go before his deadline, he would finally knuckle down and begin. He says with every new deadline he would swear he would start earlier – but never did.Now, he says he has managed to finally stop this behaviour with a surprising method – which he calls “standing in the shed”. This he says is, when you have a huge task you are putting off – such as clearing out your shed. The most important thing to do is take a tiny first step. Even imagining yourself doing it, or just going to stand in the messy shed is enough. Continue reading...","Thu, 02 Jan 2025 03:00:31 GMT",0.4404,0.669

The Guardian,Life in a Gaza field hospital – in pictures,"Over the past three months Kieran Seager photographed and interviewed staff, patients, and their families at the UK-Med field hospital in al-Mawasi, Rafah. Approximately 40% of all patients treated at the field hospital are children or young people under 18UK-Med is a UK-based medical charity, headquartered in Manchester, that has been working in Gaza since January 2024. It works across three locations in Gaza: the al-Mawasi field hospital, a smaller clinic in al-Zawaida and the emergency department at Nasser hospital. The charity employs nearly 600 Palestinian staff, who are supported by a small cadre of international medics, some of whom are from the NHS. Since January, about 30 NHS staff have rotated through Gaza, mostly on short four- to six-week deployments, drawing on a variety of medical specialists including surgeons, emergency doctors, GPs, nurses and midwives.Razan was injured by a 7.92mm bullet at 3am on 1 September. The incident happened in al-Mawasi. The bullet passed through the tent, through her mother’s hip, and into Razan, lodging itself close to her spinal cord. Razan was taken to the UK-Med field hospital immediately, where she was referred to Nasser hospital for a CT scan, then returned to the field hospital for surgery. Her mother, who was only lightly wounded as the bullet had passed right through her hip, was taken to the ICRC field hospital for treatment. The UK-Med surgical team removed the bullet from Razan’s neck. The wound has healed completely, and Razan is not suffering from any complications. I interviewed Razan’s father, Diyar, and took the accompanying photo, on 19 November at the field hospital in al-Mawasi. Continue reading...","Thu, 02 Jan 2025 07:00:37 GMT",0.0,0.3724
