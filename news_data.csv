The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Trump urges China to help end Ukraine war,"After meeting US president-elect, Volodymyr Zelenskyy cautions that Ukraine needs a ‘just and robust peace, that Russians will not destroy within a few years’. What we know on day 1,020See all our Ukraine war coverageDonald Trump has called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, a day after meeting the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in Paris, claiming Kyiv “would like to make a deal” to end its war with Russia. “There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin. Too many lives are being needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed,” Trump said on Sunday in an online post. “I know Vladimir well. This is his time to act. China can help. The world is waiting!” Trump added. Trump said both sides had suffered enormous losses in the war – which he claimed on the US election campaign trail he would be able to end “in 24 hours” if elected. “Zelenskyy and Ukraine would like to make a deal and stop the madness,” he added.Zelenskyy described his discussions with Trump, brought together by French President Emmanuel Macron, as “constructive” but gave no further details. Zelenskyy cautioned that Ukraine needs a “just and robust peace, that Russians will not destroy within a few years.” “When we talk about an effective peace with Russia, we must talk first of all about effective peace guarantees. Ukrainians want peace more than anyone else. Russia brought war to our land,” he said Sunday in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Among Zelenskyy’s inner circle, there is an increasing awareness that, as the army struggles to hold back Russia on the frontline, some kind of negotiations will be necessary soon. But they fear that without solid security guarantees from the west, a ceasefire would be meaningless.Like Joe Biden, president-elect Trump made a connection between the upheaval in Syria and Russia’s war in Ukraine, noting that allies of ousted Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in Moscow, as well as in Iran, the main sponsor of Hamas and Hezbollah, “are in a weakened state right now”. Trump has suggested that Assad’s ousting could advance the prospects for an end to fighting in Ukraine.In an interview taped on Friday, Trump said that his incoming administration would be open to reducing aid to Ukraine, which the United States has been steadfastly backing since its invasion by Russia. “Possibly. Yeah, probably, sure,” he told NBC’s Meet the Press. Trump renewed his warning to Nato allies that he did not see continued US participation in the alliance as a given during his second term. Asked whether he would consider the possibility of pulling out of Nato, Trump indicated that was an open question. “If they’re paying their bills, and if I think they’re treating us fairly, the answer is absolutely I’d stay with Nato,” he said. But if not, he was asked if he would consider pulling the US out of the alliance. Trump responded, “Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.” He refused to say if he had spoken to Putin since winning election in November. “I don’t want to say anything about that, because I don’t want to do anything that could impede the negotiation,” Trump said. The interview was taped Friday and aired on Sunday, ahead of three-way talks with Macron and Zelenskyy over the weekend in Paris.Hopes for victory, a swift end to the war and prayers for their loved ones’ survival or return from Russian captivity are among the wishes scattered throughout letters sent by Ukrainian children living in frontline areas to a volunteer group. Every winter the volunteers travel to heavily damaged cities to deliver gifts and ensure that, despite the war, Ukrainian children can celebrate the holiday season. Gift requests include power banks to help families endure outages, as well as bicycles, books and even pets. This year, the group received 2,310 letters, according to project manager Inna Achkasova from the NGO Ukrainian Frontiers, who launched the St. Nicholas’ Reindeers initiative in 2015.

The Guardian,Assad’s murderous regime has been toppled – but what will fill the vacuum in Syria? | Simon Tisdall,"The challenges ahead are truly daunting for a country torn apart by 13 years of civil war and split between rival factionsFor once, use of the word “historic” is justified in describing the toppling of Bashar al-Assad’s regime after more than 50 years of brutal dictatorship, 13 years of on-off civil war and a world of suffering. The people of Syria, or most of them at least, are jubilant. They should enjoy the moment. They deserve it. It recalls the celebrations that accompanied the fall of Iraq’s Saddam Hussein and Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi. Yet such memories carry a warning and a threat.The warning is that joy can quickly turn to tears, and liberation to renewed repression, should the sudden collapse of hated but relatively stable authoritarian structures trigger an uncontainable descent into chaos. The threat is that the ensuing political and military vacuum will be contested by self-seeking actors interested not in justice and reconciliation, but power and retribution. In Syria, revenge is a dish served hot – and it’s back on the menu. Continue reading...","Sun, 08 Dec 2024 14:59:36 GMT",-0.3818,-0.9681
The Guardian,"Labour's big Farage problem has a simple solution: build, build, build | John Harris","It’s not immigration or lack of services fuelling Reform UK’s impressive gains in the polls, but lack of social housing. Huge investment is needed nowAt last week’s Spectator parliamentarian of the year awards, Nigel Farage took the stage in front of a large chunk of the Westminster establishment, including journalists in need of a story. Honoured with a seat next to the magazine’s new proprietor, he was there to receive the newcomer of the year trophy and deliver a pithy speech written to spread fear through his audience. And so it proved. “We are about to witness a political revolution the likes of which we have not seen since Labour after the first world war,” he said. “Politics is about to change in the most astonishing way. Newcomers will win the next election. Thank you very much.” Although booze and seasonal merriment were in plentiful supply, his words were reportedly greeted by a brief outbreak of complete silence.And then came an equally sobering opinion poll. A somewhat obscure outfit called FindOutNow gave the Tories the lead on a mere 26% – but the big headline was about Farage’s party, Reform UK, rising to second place on 24%, one point higher than Labour. In response, you could feel the government’s anxiety levels spiking – whereupon Farage made yet another appearance on BBC One’s Question Time and capped a week of mouthwatering promotion.John Harris is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Sun, 08 Dec 2024 12:00:52 GMT",-0.1027,0.9818

But the very fact the question arose is a reminder of the pressing need for political funding reform on this side of the Atlantic.Musk is the living embodiment of economic power in the modern US: a multibillionaire, with spicy political views, who has bought his way into a role as Donald Trump’s costcutter-in-chief.

The Guardian,Once I would have squirmed if a barista knew my order. But I’m learning to love being a regular | Emma Beddington,"It’s nice to be known – even as someone who’s utterly predictable, cake-dependent and often unwashedWe went to the same cafe almost every day during our month-long trip to Venice. It was the same one as on my last trip, its windows stuffed full of dry-looking biscuits, slices of Barbie-pink nougat and souvenir tins with Rialto views, while pigeons milled around the door as if daring each other to enter. Inside, there was a display case of pastries, a shelf of never-touched aperitifs and an overworked coffee machine behind a high counter. It’s always packed: pensioners, dog walkers, office workers, the postwoman, dithering tourists and the bravest pigeons, cruising for crumbs.I recognised the staff though obviously they didn’t recognise me, what with 2.1 million tourists trudging past every year. But gradually we infiltrated the morning ecosystem and, after 10 days, the tall guy who operated the machine started saying: “Normale e lungo?” when we reached the front of the coffee crush. In week three, one particularly busy morning, he caught my eye as I queued and gesticulated at our already-made coffees, waiting on the counter. Cutting through to claim them, I felt like, I don’t know, George Clooney? Or at least a pigeon with recognisable markings that they don’t bother kicking out. It was a special moment: the gift of a brief sense of belonging. Continue reading...","Sun, 08 Dec 2024 14:00:56 GMT",0.7783,0.8862

Many Democrats are convinced her campaign saved the party from an even worse result. To be fair, it achieved some real highs: she won the debate. But she never won the argument, at least not with the voters who mattered most.The US election triggered a scary deja vu moment for those of us who had watched the 2019 general election from behind our sofas, hands over eyes. The Democrats lost votes with almost everyone, almost everywhere, but, like Labour in the “red wall”, most dramatically with traditional heartland voters: working class, low paid, non-graduates. And, like Labour back in 2019, that lost connection with core voters had not happened overnight. Continue reading...","Sun, 08 Dec 2024 09:00:49 GMT",0.0,-0.5828
The Guardian,"Sorry, archbishop, you need to do a bit more work on your ritual contrition skills  | Catherine Bennett","In a year of wretched public apologies, Justin Welby beats even Gregg Wallace Is a crap apology worse than no apology at all? Gregg Wallace, until Friday a strong contender for the worst public apology of the year, is not of course unusual in his struggle to act convincingly remorseful. Justin Welby, the outgoing archbishop of Canterbury – despite being one of the great institutional apologisers of all time – now seems likely to take the British title; internationally the clear winner is South Korea’s Yoon Suk Yeol. Even Wallace could tell him that when you’ve carelessly imposed martial law, it’s important to apologise to everyone, not just “the people who were very surprised”.Plainly, there are differences in style. The Wallace apology, the only one the 60-year-old has yet supplied for insulting “middle-class women of a certain age”, not only made the elementary mistake of apologising “for any offence that I caused” – as if only the pathologically over-sensitive could conceivably have objected – but compounded it, as apology novices are apt to do, with a note about his own suffering, or “poor headspace”.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"The Guardian view on the fall of Assad: a tumultuous, fragile hope in Syria | Editorial","The Middle East enters a new chapter as a dictatorship collapses, leaving a nation facing daunting challenges of reconciliation and reconstructionBashar al-Assad’s downfall came not with a bang but a whimper. The Syrian dictator reportedly fled his home in the wake of a blitzkrieg advance by a coalition of anti-government rebels. By Sunday morning he was gone – leaving armed groups as the country’s dominant political players. A spirit of anti-Assad sentiment surged across Syria, manifesting itself through displays of both celebration and defiance. The question now is whether this unleashed energy – brutally suppressed by fear and authoritarian control – will become a unifying force in building a new nation or, rather, a precursor to deeper divisions.The fall of the House of Assad, which has ruled Syria for more than half a century, should be a warning to dictatorial regimes. Mr Assad’s departure underscores a broader truth: societies cannot indefinitely tolerate systemic abuses, such as state-sponsored propaganda, corruption and violence. The fish rots from the head down. Mr Assad’s Syrian state collapsed from within, having spent more than a decade pursuing a reign of terror that only fuelled the very unrest it sought to suppress. The regime’s collapse raises pressing questions about Syria’s future. With weak institutions and a frail civil society, the risk of disintegration looms large.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

During his prime-time television address to the French nation last week, following the toppling of the centre-right prime minister he appointed only three months ago, Mr&nbsp;Macron loftily declined to take responsibility for France’s worst political crisis in decades.“Some people are tempted to blame me for this situation,” the president acidly observed after accepting Michel Barnier’s resignation. “It’s much more comfortable.” In fact, he suggested, responsibility lay entirely with the political forces who, in delivering the first no-confidence judgment on a government since 1961, had committed an “anti-republican” act of sabotage. The leftwing daily Libération offered a pithy and apt two-word headline riposte to such presidential hauteur: “Flagrant déni” (“In flagrant denial”).Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"We need proper policies, Keir Starmer, not more pledges | Letters","Shirley Osborn, Dr Robert Lockie and John Sommer on the prime minister’s new milestones and his criticism of the civil serviceHow depressing that the Labour party seems so bereft of ideas that all it can do as a new government is to castigate the civil service for its lacklustre performance (Starmer may view Whitehall reform as essential to his missions, 6 December). What does Labour expect? Any new manager worth their salt knows that it takes time and effort to motivate an understandably demoralised and paranoid workforce. If criticism is due, it should be made privately and with some understanding.What the civil service needs desperately is clearly thought out policies and a commitment to change, while knowing support will be there when this is inevitably challenged. This is where Keir Starmer and his ministers’ focus and energy should be directed, and it is concerning that this is taking such a long time coming. There is no quick fix, and turning to short-term populism is dangerous.

The Guardian,Make better use of neighbourhood EV charging | Letters,"Many electric vehicle charging points in local areas are underused, says Chas Ball, while Stephen Psallidas rejects the idea that all EV owners need a charging unit at homeI agree that chargers are key to the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), particularly as over a third of households have no space for off-street charging (Letters, 3 December). But too little is made of the existing domestic and institutional charging infrastructure close to home.I can identify underused chargers within easy walking distance of my house (which has no driveway). A 20-unit housing association development has a charge point for each house, but only a few are in use. If these householders were incentivised to join Co-Charger, an online platform and app, their neighbours, including me, would be more inclined to switch to EVs as they would have access to occasional at-home charging. Simple online payments, contributing a little more than the cost of the electricity, would avoid the 20% VAT added to public charging points and save time.

Philip Oakey’s voice remains rich and pristine and it immediately sets the tone for an evening of immaculate electro pop music delivered with grace, precision and elation.Despite once being regarded as the epitome of synth-washed futurism, tracks such as Mirror Man are a beautiful example of the group’s clear love of the 1960s, with its unquestionable Motown strut being spun into slick electronic soul and with Oakey’s voice working in seamless harmony with those of Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall.

When the sheriff (Andrew Whitehead) comes to drive them off the land and inform them that Prince John (Cameron Eggleston, part of the Rose Young Company) is visiting the Midlands with his sack of gold in tow, Marian cooks up a plan to infiltrate his castle, in order to rob the rich and feed the town’s poor.

What’s ahead in 2025, I don’t dare hazard, but here’s what I liked best from a year in which I was drawn, I now see, to character-led novels of relationships, not always dysfunctional.Intermezzo by Sally Rooney (Faber)
 She’s too shy; you can tell she didn’t study creative writing; her characters never stop eating bread... just three of the frankly batshit statements lately uttered amid the discourse frenzy that greets this gifted young novelist’s every last move. Hats off to her for blocking out the noise to rediscover her glorious A-game in a tale of two Irish-Slovak brothers struggling to emerge from the shadow of their parents’ long-ago divorce.

The Guardian,Sam Fender review – cathartic songs delivered with passion  and a humble presence,"Co-op Live, ManchesterEven when the entire crowd of 23,000 are bellowing his ‘whoah-oh-ohs’, understated Fender quips ‘got some singers here, haven’t we?’ as if performing in a local boozerThe tiny venues he started out in were never going to hold Sam Fender. Five years after his debut, the 30-year-old has conquered major festivals, packed Newcastle United’s football ground and announced more stadium dates for next year, which makes this first of two nights at the 23,500 capacity Co-op Live seem relatively intimate. The former North Shields barman’s deeply personal themes – such as Seventeen Going Under’s raging line about the benefits system (“I see my mother/the DWP see a number”) – are made universal by fantastic, epic songs, passionately delivered by what could be a geordie version of Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band.The chilling Dead Boys, about male suicide, makes a brilliantly unlikely arena opener, but Fender is previewing third album People Watching, due in the new year. Once again, his north-east upbringing provides the fuel for his fire. The thunderous title track – where “somebody’s darling’s on the street tonight” – paints a vivid snapshot of “this crippled island”, glimpsed sorrowfully through the window on a late night journey home. The bouncier Nostalgia’s Lie refuses the temptation to look back through rose-coloured glasses: “these streets break my heart”. Other songs are musically mellower. Wild Long Lie and Arm’s Length perhaps reflect the widescreen chimes of the War on Drugs or Fender’s fellow geordie Mark Knopfler. New band member Brooke Bentham (vocals/guitar), who the singer knew when they were teenage buskers, has brought a feminine dimension.

Your reputation may have enhanced your prospects but, when it came to job hunting, your qualifications and CV were pretty much the only showcase you had.With the internet everything changed – and then changed again with social media and smartphones. Suddenly, you were visible to millions of people on a device they carried around in their pockets.

He has only had a couple of hours’ jet-lagged sleep, for a start. And, despite my feeble assurances to the contrary, he knows how it goes: in the course of two hours of no doubt enjoyable free-associating chat he’ll say one thing he will regret (two hours later when he’s on the train to Brighton); and when the story appears, that phrase will be the headline, and it will follow him around on the internet for ever. “So let’s get on with it,” he says, with wide-eyed fatalism. “And let me say even as you press record and I pick up this menu that I have badly mismanaged my calories and I’m really fucking hungry.”We’re at a very smart gastropub near Victoria in London – the Thomas Cubitt, chosen for its proximity to the station (he’s got to catch the 2.29pm to make it to tonight’s gig).

I’d been speaking to autistic board gamers as research for my book on how games connect people and a few people asked if I’d ever considered that I might be autistic. In hindsight, it seems obvious – the psychologist called me “the most fantastically autistic person I’ve ever assessed”, which I suppose is an achievement – but I sat through the two-day test feeling like an impostor. I thought at any moment they would frown and say: “Why are you here? You’re not autistic. You just love games.” Continue reading...","Sun, 08 Dec 2024 09:00:49 GMT",0.0,0.9393

As we talk online, he is sitting in the offices of Paramount Pictures, in New York, appearing chill – dark suit, white shirt open at the collar, silver rings in each ear – only to suddenly cackle pleasantly at a dark thought. “Face-value people are pretty tough,” he says, of character parts he prefers to turn down. “Like, straightforward.” He pauses. “Sincerity is difficult to play.”Sarsgaard will soon appear in September 5, a film that recounts the 1972 Munich massacre, during which members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by Palestinian terrorists, as broadcast by an ABC sports crew who covered the episode live. Sarsgaard plays Roone Arledge, a brusque ABC executive. Much of his time on screen involves battling with higher-ups in order to maintain his team’s access to a story he believes, for better or worse, is a must-watch. As events progress, new questions of morality arise: if a hostage is executed and the moment captured in real time, should the footage be broadcast? In what ways does the live coverage of graphic brutality benefit viewers? In fact, for much of the ABC broadcast “nothing really happens,” Sarsgaard says. Cameras fix on a news anchor, stationed in a Munich studio, who is required to share and re-share scraps of incomplete information. The real tragedy unfolds out of sight.

The Guardian,The big picture: Tony Kearns captures stalled time at Camden Market,"The photographer’s 1980s shot of a punter and his dog shows a London destination already in thrall to its storied pastThe market at Camden Lock in north London has for 50 years been trading in trends and nostalgia. Near the site of the horse hospital that once cared for animals pulling canal barges, the modern market was established with 16 stalls in 1974 and soon became – knocking off styles from Kings Road – the primary home of London’s punk counterculture. Ever since, regulars and traders have informed newcomers and tourists that the market is not what it was. When Tony Kearns took this picture at a handbag stall at the market in 1989, Camden was already selling past images of itself. The bulldog on the punter’s shoulder captures that mood well: Camden has seen it all before.Kearns, inspired by the great street photographers Robert Doisneau, Josef Koudelka and Mary Ellen Mark, spent a lot of time between 1987 and 1994 touring London markets looking for characters and moments to photograph. In some pictures, traders have lined up bric-a-brac on the pavement or on a garden wall in hope of making a few quid. The best of that archive of images are collected in a new book, Stall Life, which captures that time when the traditional London street markets – Berwick Street and Brixton and Columbia Road, as well as Camden – still had an unlicensed, ad hoc quality, removed from the more organised destinations into which they have evolved.

The Guardian,"Glam it up, guys: partywear for men – in pictures","You can always rely on monochrome for an event look, but texture keeps it interestingWe’re a week into December and the party season is in full swing. If you’re struggling with the age old ‘what to wear’ conundrum, keep it simple. Stick with black and white and experiment with texture, it’s a versatile way to supercharge your outfit. Dolce and Gabbana’s AW24 collection is a master class in how to nail the look. Aim for contrasting textures to layer up: silk under wool, or velvet with lace adds a modern edge to the party look. Look for black-on-black embellishment for a timeless look you can wheel out every year. Reiss’s black sequin shirt (4) adds flair without being out-and-out showy, style with black trousers and loafers. Next’s subtle glitter tuxedo (8) is another affordable take on the look. For more adventurous dressers, one of the key runway trends was sheer – from full-on chest revealing transparency to more wearable gauzy shirts, like Allsaints lace one (£119) and River Island’s white lace (£46, main image above).If embellishment is too seasonal look for interesting detailing, like Represent’s zip-up jacket (2) that will look sharp long after the last champagne cork has popped on NYE . Ditto Zara’s tailored separates and Daily Paper’s chess board patterned pieces, style with a gauzy shirt for a night out, but swap in a sweater for spring. For more formal events, velvet blazers always look super chic over a fine-gauge black rollneck. Continue reading...","Sat, 07 Dec 2024 23:50:37 GMT",0.0,0.9814
