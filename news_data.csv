The Guardian,Ukraine war briefing: Ukraine drones hit Russian oil depot; Trump floats fresh Russia sanctions,"Ukraine claims strikes on oil depot and aviation plant inside Russia; Trump talks Ukraine negotiations, Russia sanctions and how China should do more to end the war. What we know on day 1,064 See all our Ukraine war coverageUkraine fired a wave of drones into Russia sparking a blaze at an oil depot and explosions at a plant producing military aircraft, the Ukrainian army said on Tuesday. In the western Voronezh region bordering Ukraine, Kyiv said it struck an oil depot near the town of Liski for the second time in less than a week. “Tanks with fuel and lubricants used by the occupiers to supply Russian troops caught fire,” the Ukrainian army said. Ukraine also said it struck an aviation plant producing “combat aircraft” in the western Russian city of Smolensk, sparking “explosions”. The governor of the Smolensk region said only that falling debris from downed drones had sparked “roof fires”. Footage and pictures online backed up the Ukrainian versions of events. Russia said it downed 55 Ukrainian drones over Monday night, more than half of which were intercepted over regions bordering Ukraine, while Ukraine said Moscow fired 131 drones and decoys as well as four missiles at its territory.Donald Trump has said it “sounds like” the US might impose fresh sanctions on Russia if its president, Vladimir Putin, refuses to negotiate about ending the war in Ukraine. Trump said on Monday that the Russian president “should make a deal … I think he’s destroying Russia by not making a deal”. The US has already sanctioned Russia heavily and Trump gave no details on possible additional sanctions. “We’re talking to [Ukrainian president Volodymyr] Zelenskyy, we’re going to be talking with President Putin very soon,” Trump said. “We’re going to look at it.”Trump said he had pressed the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in a call to intervene to stop the Ukraine war. “He’s not done very much on that. He’s got a lot of … power, like we have a lot of power. I said, ‘You ought to get it settled.’ We did discuss it.” In Moscow, the Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said Putin and Xi on Tuesday discussed talks with Donald Trump and the outlook for a possible peace deal to end the war in Ukraine. Xi told Putin about a call with Trump, Ushakov said.Trump claimed “Russia never would have gone into Ukraine” had he been president instead of Joe Biden. “I had a very strong understanding with Putin. That would have never, ever happened. He disrespected Biden. Very simple. He disrespects people. He’s smart. He understands. He disrespected Biden.” Trump said his administration was also looking at the issue of sending weapons to Ukraine, adding his view that the EU should be doing more to support Ukraine.Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has said that “at least 200,000” allied troops would be needed to enforce any peace deal in Ukraine as he urged Europe to “take care of itself” as Donald Trump returns to power in the US. Luke Harding writes that Zelenskyy said European leaders should not ask themselves what Trump would do next, and said that they instead needed to take collective steps to defend their continent at a time when it was under aggressive attack by Russia. “Will President Trump even notice Europe? Does he see Nato as necessary? And will he respect EU institutions?” Zelenskyy told reporters he was working on meeting Trump but there was no date yet. “We want to finish the war and President Trump says that he also really would like to finish the war, and I believe he will help us with this.” Continue reading...","Wed, 22 Jan 2025 01:15:16 GMT",-0.3818,-0.9609

After Axel Rudakubana unexpectedly pleaded guilty to the murder of three girls and the attempted murder of 10 others at a dance class in Southport last July, the prime minister was determined not to be caught out again.

I would also kill a clown as soon as look at one, but I don’t consider that a phobia. It is a well-grounded, sensible protective instinct because clowns are clearly wrong on every level.We are all, I suspect, scared of, repulsed by, or rendered incoherent with disgust about something that others approach with perfect equanimity. However sensible you are, however sanguine and reasonable, it seems a part of every human brain cannot be content without sabotaging your smooth passage through life.

To all the leaders pledging to work with him: good luck with thatFull American democracy is barely 60 years old, yet seems to be in an advanced state of cognitive decline. At his inauguration yesterday, Donald Trump seated the tech bosses, his nerd broligarchy, in front of his supposed cabinet. Needless to say, it was all a hopelessly overstimulating day for Elon Musk, whose double salute on stage later was a pure Dr Strangelove spasm, generously described by the Anti-Defamation league as “an awkward gesture”. Listen, if your friends won’t tell you, then who will?As for the staging of the inauguration, which was moved indoors several days earlier, it was an occasion devoid of a sense of occasion. I would honestly have preferred Trump to ride in on the QAnon shaman. Instead, and not to get all British about state events, the world was forced to watch a quite staggeringly inept and lo-fi ceremony. You constantly expected someone to grab the mic and say: “Could the owner of a red Honda Civic please move your car as it’s blocking in the burger van.” Or maybe, as viewers round the globe sat waiting in mortified vain for singer Carrie Underwood’s basic backing track to kick in, to announce: “Apologies, ladies and gents, we have a tech fail.

The Guardian,The great Harry and Meghan debate rages on – but I’m staying out of it | Zoe Williams,"The exiled royals are caught between their need for attention and their disgust at the tabloid media crusade against them. I won’t pick a side in this tawdry culture warIt may have been straight after Megxit – when Meghan and Harry decided to “step back” from the royal family in 2020; or it may have been a year later, when Oprah Winfrey stepped in to clear things up in a long interview that made everyone in and around the history of British royalty – basically all of us, everywhere – sound quite bad. Either way, it was a while ago that I decided to have no further view on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Or were we supposed to change their address once they’d left: Commoner and Commonness of Sussex? Not my concern: as I said, no further view.Called upon to pick a side in any given culture war, you always have to gloss over certain complexities and contradictions, and nowhere more so than in this one. Inconveniently, it’s possible for all the things to be true. It’s possible that there are racists in the royal household, and for Meghan Markle to have been rude to members of it. It’s possible that Prince William bullied Prince Harry remorselessly, while Harry himself, in a different context – a Spotify production meeting, for instance – is the difficult one. It’s possible, indeed observable, that the British tabloid media waged a crusade against Meghan, attacking everything from her comportment while pregnant (according to the Express, she used “sneaky tricks to flaunt her bump”) to the implications of her vegetable preferences (the Daily Mail memorably associated her, via the avocado, with human rights abuses, drought and murder). It’s true that much of the red-tops’ coverage was racist, and plausible – as Meghan and Harry argue convincingly in their 2022 Netflix documentary – that this unleashed a tide of white-supremacist bile on social media.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And tech just can’t do thatAllison Pugh is a professor of sociology at Johns Hopkins University, and the author of The Last Human Job: The Work of Connecting in a Disconnected WorldWhen I interviewed a nurse practitioner in California about what she cherished most about nursing, it was the “human element” of being present with others. “I think we all just want acknowledgment of our suffering, even if you can’t cure it or do anything about it,” she told me.She still remembered when a homeless man came into her clinic, his back hunched, feet gnarled and callused from being on the streets for years, and she “just sat and did wound care for his feet”. The moment stood out for her, in part because the opportunity to take that kind of time is getting rarer in clinics and hospitals as drives for efficiency impose time constraints.Allison Pugh is a professor of sociology at Johns Hopkins University, and the author of The Last Human Job: The Work of Connecting in a Disconnected World.

The Guardian,Gatwick still beats Heathrow hands-down if we must have another runway | Nils Pratley,"Pollution aside, the problem with expanding Heathrow lies in the disruption and delay inevitable in such a complex projectGet ready for another season of that interminable saga, Heathrow’s third runway. There was a lull during the Covid pandemic when the airport’s owners, despite winning permission from the supreme court in 2020 to submit a planning application, cooled their jets while they waited for passenger numbers to recover. Now the whole thing is back, courtesy of Rachel Reeves. The chancellor is reported to be preparing to use a speech next week to declare support for a third runway at Heathrow alongside wider airport expansion in the south-east.The best form of airport expansion is none at all, environmentalists (some of them in the cabinet) will argue, but it looks as if Reeves has dismissed those objections in the name of economic growth. A £1.1bn investment in Stansted, to enable it to grow its annual capacity from 29 million passengers to 43 million, was welcomed by the government last year.

The Guardian,There's a way to beat a far-right takeover in the UK. So why has Starmer gone silent about it? | Polly Toynbee,"With Trump back in the White House, democracy is in danger across the west. Electoral reform is the best way to protect itInauguration day in the US signalled the drum beat of the far right sweeping across western democracies. According to Sadiq Khan, now is the time to be “unflinching in defence of our democracy and values”. Rightly, Khan warned that “the spectre of a resurgent fascism haunts the west” as Europe’s hard-right politicians, including some from Britain, gathered in Washington to welcome the new president.Mayors are in a unique position: they can give voice to what many think but the government cannot say, bound as it is by diplomacy and trade links. Protecting democracy, Khan said, will mean ministers must “ratchet up” pressure on social media companies to stop “a billionaire bully” using his social media platform to amplify lies and “advance the cause of the far right”.

The Guardian,South Korean democracy was nearly toppled by its president. It was saved by its people | Youngmi Kim,"Despite scandal after scandal, Koreans have shown their solidarity with one another, and the resilience of their institutionsCompared with other advanced industrialised countries, South Korea is still a young democracy, having only transitioned from authoritarian to democratic rule in 1987. However, the political freedoms and beliefs Koreans have come to take for granted were suddenly shattered on 3 December, when President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law, citing anti-state activities and collaboration with North Korea by some political actors as his reason for doing so.His actions utterly shocked the country, and MPs promptly gathered at the national assembly in a clear act of defiance of the ban on political activities that accompanied the imposition of martial law. All 190 members of parliament who were present that night (out of a total of 300) had made it through the cordons of special forces around the parliament building and voted to nullify the law within hours of its imposition. President Yoon quickly repealed the law. Tens of thousands of ordinary citizens filled the streets around the national assembly calling for presidential impeachment. It took two attempts before enough MPs would vote to impeach the president. Watching Yoon appear at his impeachment hearing today, these may appear to be very dark days for democracy. But in reality, these events should give Koreans hope.Youngmi Kim is senior lecturer at the University of Edinburgh and director of the Scottish Centre for Korean Studies Continue reading...","Tue, 21 Jan 2025 15:26:29 GMT",0.4215,-0.2952

Office holders have been assassinated, ousted and impeached. Former leaders have faced corruption investigations and sometimes lengthy prison terms.Yoon Suk Yeol has nonetheless set a precedent as the first president to be arrested in office. Accused of insurrection over his short-lived attempt to impose martial law, the former prosecutor has swapped his suits for the standard khaki uniform of a detainee. In a&nbsp;piquant detail, the man who led his country’s first impeachment of a president, Park&nbsp;Geun‑hye, has also&nbsp;been impeached himself.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on England's regional divides: still crazy after all these years | Editorial,"A new study reveals the extent to which the economy remains one of the most unbalanced in Europe. Labour needs a broader vision to address the problemOne of Labour’s first actions in office was to rename the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, ditching the Johnsonian slogan that briefly dominated British politics following the “red&nbsp;wall” election of 2019. Since July, the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, has instead presided over the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. The change of title reflected a shift in emphasis. While still hoping to lift the fortunes of post‑industrial towns in the north and Midlands, the new government’s overriding mission was to raise living standards across the country by investing in a&nbsp;new era of higher growth and productivity.Amid market turbulence and gloomy economic prognoses, the early challenges to that approach have been well documented. Meanwhile, the country’s regional divides remain as deep and corrosive as ever. This week, a report by the Centre for Cities thinktank offers a salutary reminder of the yawning gaps that led&nbsp;to talk of levelling up and “rebalancing” the economy in the first place.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Set in the early 1960s, the film reminded us of how Dylan ignited and spoke for the interests of young people, starting out with simple folk songs of hope and aspiration, swiftly followed by angry snarls of rage exacerbated by the assassinations of John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King.With Trump once again ensconced in the White House, promising/threatening a multitude of actions, now is surely the time for a new Dylan to appear – hopefully someone who can galvanise and electrify a new generation and then inspire and support a viable new Democrat leader who can first provide opposition to any Trump excesses and then fight to ensure that his like never succeeds again (Trump sworn in as 47th president as US braces for a new era of disruption and division, 20 January).Toby WoodPeterborough Continue reading...","Tue, 21 Jan 2025 17:55:58 GMT",0.0,0.7317

Its secret? Letting us indulge our fantasies of treacheryIn the latest episode of The Traitors UK, the final eight players gathered at a candlelit dinner party. After weeks of fraught gameplay, they shared what they would do with the prize money if they were to win. Their teary stories were emotional: donations to disability charities, IVF journeys, putting kids through university and long-overdue honeymoons. The message was clear: these are good people. But suddenly, the game recommenced and we once again wondered: are they?“To finish that dinner and say goodnight to everyone, knowing one of them might be ‘murdered’ that night …” says Minah Shannon, one of the titular traitors who will be secretly deciding which faithfuls to kill off that night, before breaking out into laughter. “Oh my god, I’m a psychopath!” Alongside her fellow traitors, the 29-year-old call centre manager from Liverpool has betrayed and backstabbed her way through the game. But far from being considered a villain, she has become a fan favourite. This surprising turn is mostly down to the format of The Traitors.

And does a preference for Lord of the Rings over The Matrix indicate that we are all doomed? Our critic tries to sift fact from fiction …We are decadent. It’s obvious. Look around you. Books have been replaced by screens, restaurants are bigger cultural events than art (though they too are dying), and our highest cultural temple is The Traitors. “Western civilisation is being destroyed by its own decadence,” ran a Daily Telegraph headline last year. In his book The Decadent Society, American journalist Ross Douthat argues that the US has been in decline ever since Neil Armstrong got back from the moon. And conservative provocateur Michel Houellebecq has made the decadence of the west a pervasive theme of his novels – including the most recent, Annihilation, which I got for Christmas and read by twinkling tree lights, its bleak vision gradually sapping my festive spirit. So now I am going to inflict Houellebecq’s story on you.A French civil servant, returning to his teenage bedroom, sees his old posters for The Matrix Revolutions and it all comes flooding back. He was obsessed with that 2003 film, he remembers, but his younger sister Cécile and her generation had other fandoms: “Not Nirvana now, but Radiohead; and not The Matrix, but The Lord of the Rings. There were only two years between them, but that might have been enough to explain the difference, things still moved quite quickly in those days, much less quickly than in the 1960s, of course, or even in the 1970s, the deceleration and immobilisation of the west, heralding its annihilation, had been progressive.” Continue reading...","Tue, 21 Jan 2025 11:12:44 GMT",0.0,-0.7343

The Guardian,The secret to a great plant-based ‘cheese’ sauce | Kitchen aide,"Nutritional yeast is a great sub for that tangy flavour, nuts are good for building texture and read on for a wily trick with leeks …I love cheese sauce, but I’m now plant-based. Are there any easy alternatives? I don’t want to use too many processed foods. Mike Davies, chef/owner of The Camberwell Arms in London, says he discovered “the dark arts” of plant-based “cheese” sauce from his wife, Bonita, who happens to be both vegan and a chef. The simple answer, he says, is to make a vegan bechamel, which can be achieved in one of two ways. The first comes courtesy of Bonita herself: “She makes a roux with plant-based gear, then flavours it with nutritional yeast to get those cheesy, umami vibes.” You can then adulterate this further, be that with some mustard powder (as Davies’ mother does), a grating of nutmeg or a pinch of cayenne.A roux is also Katy Beskow’s preferred route, especially when a lasagne or cauliflower cheese are in play: “I use a basic method,” says the author of Vegan Pantry. “Take 50g vegan butter and 50g flour, and make a roux in the usual way. Add some oat milk, then, once that’s nice and thick, add nutritional yeast.” Yes, oat milk and vegan butter are processed foods, Beskow concedes, so look for ones with a low number of ingredients.Got a culinary dilemma?

The Guardian,"‘If you wee yourself, you just rock on’: is incontinence inevitable for women who lift heavy?","One study found athletes were three times as likely to leak as women who did little or no exercise. But why does this happen – and can you prevent it?On a wall in a gym in south London, someone has written: “PB [personal best] with a bit of wee.” Who could have written it? A runner? A woman doing CrossFit who has been jumping rope? A powerlifter? Evidence shows that all these activities can trigger higher rates of urinary incontinence (UI) in women than other activities. (Men’s anatomy is different, so they are less prone to the problem.)“Women pee. In my gym you see it all the time,” says Emily Westray, a 27-year-old civil servant in Sheffield who can bench press 75kg, deadlift 130kg and squat 115kg, while only weighing 57kg herself.

What is its appeal?You are never far from a great wave. Its foaming crest froths and sputters like ghostly fingers or monstrous claws raking over tote bags and journals. You can probably find it miniaturised in your emoji keyboard on your phone, and fading on a mouse mat or pair of socks somewhere nearby. The image – officially known as Under the Wave off Kanagawa, from Katsushika Hokusai’s series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji – depicts small boats facing down a large wave, and almost two centuries after its creation its appeal spans generations, continents, and socioeconomic bands.In 2023, a Great Wave print sold for a record $2.76m (£2.26m) at Christie’s in New York. The following year, in Japan, the image debuted on the new 1,000 yen banknote, the country’s lowest-value paper money. You can equally well hang the wave from your keyring or apply its decals to your Porsche. British heritage companies such as Dartington Crystal sell it wrapped around fusty-looking vases, while at the edgier end of the high street, Urban Outfitters has printed it on to clothing. It is almost impossible to imagine where a Great Wave would look out of place. You can even buy it splashed across an umbrella. It must feel strange to keep dry under a great wave, but this artwork has become a catch-all image, the ultimate mixer of metaphors.
