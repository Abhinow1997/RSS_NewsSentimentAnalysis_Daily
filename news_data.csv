What if you start with the little things instead?I used to be really interested in the world. I’d read lots of news, books from authors around the world and had opinions about world events. I work for a charity that works globally too. But lately I’ve become less engaged. I don’t know if it’s due to having children, fatigue or the harshness of the world, but I feel unplugged from it all and not interested. Equally I’m not interested in anything else as an alternative. I feel my world becoming smaller. I spend hours scrolling Instagram too. How can I find “something” to be interested in again?Eleanor says: When I was in my early teens my dad was trying to explain depression to me because a dear friend had it and I thought she was making a mistake. I interrupted him to pause and savour a bite of sourdough toast with cream cheese. He pointed to that exact moment – there – that’s what your friend can’t feel right now.

But my favourite thing is whipping up treats for loved ones• Sign up here for our weekly food newsletter, FeastLast Christmas, a chef I regularly work with admitted he hates homemade gifts. Needless to say, I was aghast; who doesn’t love a homemade edible gift?! Perhaps he has been scarred by endless jars of hedgerow jams and allotment veg chutney over the years (although I’m not sure I could ever get sick of homemade chutney, especially if it is one of Chetna Makan’s recipes). This chef is a dear friend, so I have done what any good friend would do and, ever since, have given him a homemade gift each time I’ve given him a present. It got me thinking about edible gifts, what constitutes a good one and why I love them so much.I’ll start with a disclaimer: I adore Christmas. I’m talking light-up earrings, carols around the village Christmas tree and Felicity Cloake’s mulled wine on repeat – I love it all. However, I do get overwhelmed by the amount of stuff that appears at this time of year. Do we need more stuff? Family and friends will ask me: “What do you want? What do you need?” There is, in fact, very little that I need, and what I actually want is the recipe for your infamous chocolate cake or your granny’s recipe for her slow-cooked ragu. (Clearly I’m not the only one, given the success of online sensation Pasta Grannies.) Or perhaps a bottle of that premixed margarita you made last time I visited your house. To be honest, you could bottle up any of these pitcher-style cocktails and I’d be thrilled. I love it all. Continue reading...","Thu, 05 Dec 2024 16:00:30 GMT",0.6369,0.9978

The Guardian,Rumours review – close encounters for Cate Blanchett and the magnificent G7,"Seven world leaders – including Charles Dance’s dozy US president – are trapped in a forest in this amusing but bizarre apocalyptic comedyCate Blanchett has supplied the strangest moment of this year’s Cannes film festival; for Brits of a certain age, anyway. Her character reverently invokes the name of the late Roy Jenkins, Labour grandee and former chancellor of both the exchequer and Oxford University. Blanchett plays a fictional German chancellor called Hilda Ortmann who mentions Jenkins as the first president of the European Commission allowed to attend a G7 summit (which, as political trivia connoisseurs would say, is “one for the heads”.) Perhaps in her next film Blanchett can do a big speech about Peter Shore.Rumours is an amusing drawing-room absurdist comedy, co-written and directed by Canadian film-maker Guy Maddin with his longtime collaborators, the brothers Evan and Galen Johnson. The title is inspired by the 1977 Fleetwood Mac album, because of the emotional crises that are said to have accompanied its recording. The setting is a forest in the German town of Dankerode in Saxony where a fictional G7 summit is taking place. Seven government heads have gathered to discuss an unspecified (but apparently ecological) crisis and to draft a lengthy and fantastically unhelpful communique which, as Hilda murmurs to her French counterpart, President Sylvain Broulez (Denis Ménochet), should be worded vaguely enough so they are not committed to any specific action.

The Guardian,I gave up bulk buying – and changed my attitude to money | Emma Brockes,"Haul culture, fast fashion and warehouse shopping are not only a waste of hard-earned cash and resources but a titanic misuse of timeOne of the conventional pleasures of the American shopping experience has been buying more than you need while telling yourself you are being highly efficient. Beans in 12-packs; two, gallon-bottles of olive oil shackled at the collar bone; high-end electronics like the multipack Philips Sonicare electric toothbrushes I once bought for $300. $300! Where are those toothbrushes now? No idea. In the name of economy I did this for years, until all of a sudden I didn’t.Times change, our awareness as consumers grows and eventually, if we’re lucky, it starts to dawn on us that warehouse shopping not only turns our apartments into storerooms but that the experience enables more waste than efficiency. As epiphanies go, it’s up there with realising you don’t have to say yes when someone offers you their kids’ cast offs – a moment captured in Emily Mester’s sly and brilliant new book, American Bulk: Essays on Excess. Mester, who chronicles a childhood spent browsing the aisles at Costco in the suburban Midwest, looks not only at the rise of ever more disposable goods but at the relationship we as consumers have with them.

Mothers, as a rule, are not known for their ungenerous assessments of their sons’ behavior. But Penelope Hegseth, the mother of the Fox News personality Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Defense, once did just that in an email to her son.“I have no respect for a man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego,” Hegseth’s mother wrote to him. “You are that man (and have been for years) and as your mother, it pains and embarrasses me to say that, but it’s the sad, sad truth.” The email – which Hegseth’s mother later disavowed – appears to have come around the time of the dissolution of Hegseth’s second marriage; during Hegseth’s first marriage, according to a new report by Vanity Fair, he confessed to no fewer than five affairs.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist Continue reading...","Wed, 04 Dec 2024 20:43:29 GMT",-0.2263,-0.9822

But for those with nutrient deficiencies, vitamin supplements have clear benefitsSupplements are no cottage industry: an estimated third to nearly half of Australians regularly take vitamins or minerals.Hawked by the likes of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, vitamin gummies have in recent years found popularity among millennials and zoomers, who are more receptive to supplements in the form of “powders, liquids and gummies” than older generations. Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop – no stranger to dubious health trends – sells its own line of such supplements. Continue reading...","Wed, 04 Dec 2024 14:00:29 GMT",0.7929,0.928
The Guardian,The Guardian view on humanities in universities: closing English Literature courses signals a crisis,"With degrees disappearing and reading rates plummeting, the arts face a critical moment in education and cultureThe announcement that Canterbury Christ Church University in Kent is to stop offering English literature degrees has set several hares running, most of them in the wrong direction. The university said in effect that hardly anyone wanted to study English literature at degree level any more and the course was therefore no longer viable. If you can’t do EngLit in the city of Chaucer and Marlowe, where can you do it?Canterbury’s tale is a familiar one. EngLit is in wholesale retreat at A level, with numbers down from 83,000 in 2013 to 54,000 in 2023, and there has been a decline at university, too, over the past decade, though statistics are disputed because the subject gets studied at degree level in many guises, including creative writing and linguistics. Overall, humanities subjects seem to be losing their appeal, with only 38% of students taking a course in 2021/22, down from nearly 60% between 2003/4 and 2015/16.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Chelsea’s WSL dominance: team brilliance tests league competitiveness,"Five-time champions continue breaking records, widening the gap in women’s football as financial disparities challenge league competitivenessWhen Chelsea’s women’s football team take to the pitch for their first December match, it’s likely they’ll secure yet another three points to add to their winning run in what looks set to be a record-breaking season. Only eight games in, the gap between the Blues and the rest of the Women’s Super League (WSL) has already widened into a chasm. The defending champions look too good for the competition. Chelsea have won five titles in a row (and seven of the last 10).Invincibles? This team is proving that dominance isn’t just a goal — it’s their standard. Chelsea’s female footballers sit five points ahead of Manchester City and if they win their next two matches — against Brighton and Leicester City — they’ll surpass Arsenal as record holders for the most successive wins at the beginning of a season. In Europe the team have already clinched their place in the Women’s Champions League quarter-finals. Continue reading...","Thu, 05 Dec 2024 18:00:32 GMT",0.6908,0.9876

The Guardian,How do you save a dying mobile game? Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp has the answer,"The mortality rate for such games is high when developers stop updating them. But when Nintendo killed off Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, it found a novel way to extend its life – and now it’s even betterAt some point, most mobile games die. Apple’s iOS software updates have killed thousands of App Store games over the years: older games simply disappear, unless their developers make them compatible with every new device or software. (Most don’t, or can’t, devote such resources to that.) And for live mobile games, which encourage users to log in every day, the game’s popularity inevitably wanes and its developer stops updating it, leaving it inert and unplayable. Sometimes there is no warning. A game is there one day and gone the next. A bleak fate indeed.The mortality rate for mobile games is high: 83% of them fail within their first three years, according to one survey. But perhaps there’s another way. In 2017, Nintendo released a mobile version of its bestselling chill life-simulation game Animal Crossing. Named Pocket Camp, it ran for seven years before Nintendo ended support for it last month. But instead of letting the game die, the company has released a complete version for £8.99, packaging up years of content and letting players either transfer their data and keep their memories, or start fresh. The game lives on. Continue reading...","Wed, 04 Dec 2024 09:30:31 GMT",0.4939,-0.8966

I wasn’t sectioned and no one, except me, had really been concerned about my behaviour. The doctor didn’t seem too worried, so neither was I. Off I&nbsp;went, unmedicated, with a sense of&nbsp;relief at having the great mystery of my mental health revealed.For the next eight months, I&nbsp;persevered in my job and with a&nbsp;relationship that left me a guilt-ridden, anxious, isolated mess.

For years, they had dragged me along on fishing trips until I was old enough to resist. This meant days of tangled lines, grey skies, wind, rain, mud and tears. It meant sitting on the bank, cold and bored, being handed rods to reel in fish, struggling to cast. Continue reading...","Tue, 03 Dec 2024 23:59:07 GMT",0.25,-0.5574
