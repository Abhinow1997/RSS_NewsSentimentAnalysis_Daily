 Nearly all medics (94%) fear patients are coming to harm because of the conditions in A&amp;E departments around the UK, according to a snapshot survey of 83 medics from emergency departments from the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM). Most (87%) are not confident their departments will cope well over the winter months, while 41% feel less prepared for this winter compared with last year.More than four-fifths (83%) of the emergency doctors surveyed between 7 and 13 November said patients were being cared for in corridors, which can leave people stranded for hours on trolleys or chairs, while more than half (51%) had seen patients forced to wait outside emergency departments in ambulances.

Pearson has said officers told her they were planning to record a non-hate crime incident (NCHI) against her, an incident that does not meet the threshold for a crime. Essex police say the alleged offence was being treated as a criminal matter, not an NCHI.

The Guardian,‘It’s the opposite of Trump’s agenda’: Parks and Recreation’s Jim O’Heir on the show’s legacy,"As the ex-president returns, the masterly comedy about local government can feel like a fantasy. But its message is more relevant than everIt’s been nearly a decade, and three presidential administrations, since Parks and Recreation aired its final season. In that time, the sunny comedy about local government has become a modern classic. It’s also become a time capsule for a certain Obama-era mindset: its relentlessly upbeat protagonist, Amy Poehler’s Leslie Knope, wholeheartedly believes in government’s power to make people’s lives better. In 2009, its optimism was contagious.The show concluded in 2015 after seven delightful seasons. In the intervening years, many observers – including the show’s co-creator, Michael Schur – have described Parks and Recreation as the product of a different time. America’s recent re-Maga-ning has made that assessment even more trenchant. In its time, Parks felt like a small-town sitcom; in 2024 it can feel like a fantasy.

The Guardian,Bank of Mum and Dad: why we all now live in an ‘inheritocracy’,"Family wealth dictates our life choices. So is the Bank of Mum and Dad now behind so many of society’s growing inequalities?You know the Bank of Mum and Dad when you see it: it’s your friend who seems broke, but always has a safety net, or who suddenly (but discreetly) acquires the deposit for a home. It’s those who stayed with their parents while they saved for a flat, or stuck it out in a profession they were passionate about even though the wages are chronically low. It’s those who do not need to consider the financial costs of having children. It’s those whose grandparents are covering nursery or university fees, with the Bank of Grandma and Grandad already driving an economic wedge between different cohorts in generations Alpha (born between 2010 and 2024) and Z (born in the late 1990s and early 2000s).This is the picture we know, but the Bank of Mum and Dad is not just a luxury confined to the 1% – it is also evident in families like mine. I grew up in a working-class household and was the first person in my family to get a degree, but it was the fact my parents had scrimped in the 1980s to purchase properties in London (and allowed me to crash in one throughout my 20s) that has arguably been the true source of opportunities in my life.

The Guardian,A Short History of British Architecture by Simon Jenkins review – Doric columns and grand designs: the greatest hits,"In a book of two halves, Jenkins seeks to educate readers in the ‘language’ of style as well as offer a polemic on the ravages visited upon our cities by modernist planners“My dream is that people’s eyes will be opened instinctively to their surroundings,” says Simon Jenkins at the end of his new book. “I want people to point at buildings, laugh, cry or get angry. I want them to hate and to love what they see. I want them to speak architecture.” So he has written A Short History of British Architecture, which he hopes will help people understand what he calls the “language” of styles – such things as the difference between Doric and Corinthian columns, or between early English and perpendicular gothic.It turns out to be two books in one. The first 200 pages are a brisk rattle through four-and-a-half millennia of the greatest hits of British building from Stonehenge onwards, talking about cathedrals, country houses and monuments rather than the places of everyday life, delivered with the measured if sometimes opinionated tone of a benign tour guide.

The choreographer and director is speaking to me not far from where he was born, in north Dublin, where his new piece Nobodaddy has been playing to sold-out houses at the Dublin theatre festival. He asks if it mattered that I, a Londoner, hadn’t got all the Irish references in it. Well, my experience was certainly enriched by a local friend pointing out a characteristically Irish way of saying “yeah, yeah, yeah” on an inbreath (technically, it is the “pulmonic ingressive”), for example, or giving me some backstory to Irish showbands. In the end I say: what I don’t know I don’t know, the piece just needs to work enough without me needing to know. He laughs and nods (he laughs a lot, often at himself), and I reckon we’ve arrived at one answer why his work crosses borders: there’s Irishness in it, but it’s not an entry requirement.

Here’s why tuna mayo will never be the same againIt’s a weekday lunchtime and about 30&nbsp;people, mostly millennials in fashionable hiking trainers, are milling around in an alleyway off London’s Hackney Road. The scent of a wood-fired oven wafts in as everyone waits for the sandwich they preordered the night before; a maximum of 200 will be sold. Rogue Sarnies isn’t the only sandwich place taking preorders these days. Eric’s and Chatsworth Bakehouse, both in London, and Fat Pat’s in Manchester do it too. It speaks to the prudence of the operators – wasting as little as possible – and confirms the sandwich as a status symbol, something to post&nbsp;about for clout, replacing burgers and joining baked goods as items to display in foodies’ social media feeds.Sahil Patel and two friends, who live nearby, have been to Rogue Sarnies every Thursday for a month, working their way through the menu. “We normally get four sandwiches and share,” Patel says. “There’s a new one today, the bolognese.” All agree that their favourite so far is a stir-fry pork number. The sandwiches are stacked and made with wood-fired bread similar to a crisp pizza base. They also cost north of £10, but “it’s like a three-course meal in one bite”, Patel says.

The Guardian,The streetlights going out over Britain tell a brutal story: austerity isn't over – it's getting worse | John Harris,"Labour won’t achieve its aim of reviving the UK’s economy until it takes the plight of cash-starved councils more seriouslyAll over the country, the lights are going out. The level of need for adult and children’s care is constantly increasing. People are still suffering the dire human effects of the pandemic. Thanks to the long years when Conservative politicians mercilessly cut the money that went from Whitehall to councils, the fear of municipal bankruptcy now stalks scores of places. And after years of cuts, in the face of other rising costs – including funding special needs education and providing temporary accommodation for those who are homeless – the local politicians who have to somehow find a way through all this face an impossible question: how else can they reduce their spending? The answers involve vital services. But as winter bites and the nights draw in, one set of savings comes with an awful symbolism.Our streetlamps are being dimmed, switched off and left broken: over the past 15 years, the majority of councils are reckoned to have taken such decisions. And, of course, this great switch-off is bound up with all the other ongoing local cuts: to social work, road maintenance, transport for disabled people, domestic abuse services, youth clubs, libraries, leisure centres, bus subsidies, parks, and more. For millions of people, the continued hacking down of the most basic amenities and infrastructure seals a sense of deep neglect, and the feeling that politicians at the top choose to look away. When Rachel Reeves gave her budget speech a few weeks ago, she repeated a stock Labour line: “I said there would be no return to austerity; that is the choice I have made today.” The truth is that local austerity is not just grinding on, but getting worse.John Harris is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Sun, 17 Nov 2024 12:00:08 GMT",-0.802,-0.9125

The Guardian,The appointment of Robert F Kennedy has horrified public health experts. Here are his three most dangerous ideas | Devi Sridhar,"He says his goal is to “Make America healthy again”. But behind the laudable slogan there’s a morass of conspiracy theoriesProf Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghThe announcement that Donald Trump has appointed Robert F Kennedy as the US secretary of health and human services has sent shock waves through the health and scientific community. Kennedy ran as an independent presidential candidate before bowing out and supporting Trump’s run in exchange for an influential position, so we have a pretty good idea of his positions on public health.The main goal Kennedy has trumpeted recently is to “Make America healthy again”. At face value, it’s a noble aim. That’s the essence of public health: how to reduce risk factors for disease and mortality at a population level and improve the quality of health and wellbeing. But behind this slogan comes a darker, conspiracy-laden agenda. As someone who has spent a lot of time researching global public health, these are the positions I believe could be the most dangerous.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I watched my sons’ primary school headteacher gleefully set fire to a Zozobra-adjacent humanoid – bonhomme hiver – to banish winter; dodged carnival figures in straw-stuffed tunics, blank white masks and vast ostrich-plume headdresses hurling oranges into crowds; and heard children cry in real terror at the prospect of being stuffed in a sack and dragged to Spain by Saint Nick’s nasty sidekick.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Farmers have hoarded land for too long. Inheritance tax will bring new life to rural Britain | Will Hutton,"Prices and rents will fall under Rachel Reeves’ plans, enabling a younger generation with new ideas to enter the field One of the baleful dimensions of our times is the way that the conversation about what constitutes the good society is framed by the rich and their interests. A conception of the common good withers; instead it is replaced by the existential importance of private wealth, private interests and private ownership to societal health. Nowhere is this more exposed than in the debate over taxation, and in particular the taxation of inherited wealth – as the debate over the past fortnight has dramatised.Half a million people die every year. Under the reforms to inheritance tax relief on agricultural land proposed in the budget, about 500 individuals who inherit land worth more than £2m (£3m if they were married to the deceased) will join the rest of society and have inheritance tax levied on their bequest – albeit at half the rate, with an enlarged exemption and 10 years to pay it, concessions not made to the rest of us. How fortunate and privileged are they? Continue reading...","Sun, 17 Nov 2024 07:00:03 GMT",0.0,0.9786
The Guardian,How to survive the broligarchy: 20 lessons for the post-truth world | Carole Cadwalladr,"In the wake of Trump’s unnerving appointees, the investigative journalist and veteran of the libel court offers pointers on coping in an age of surveillance1 When someone tells you who they are, believe&nbsp;them. Last week Donald Trump appointed a director of intelligence who spouts Russian propaganda, a Christian nationalist crusader as secretary of defence, and a secretary of health who is a vaccine sceptic. If Trump was seeking to destroy American democracy, the American state and American values, this is how he’d do it.2 Journalists are first, but everyone else is next.  Trump has announced multibillion-dollar lawsuits against “the enemy camp”: newspapers and publishers. His proposed FBI director is on record as wanting to prosecute certain journalists. Journalists, publishers, writers, academics are always in the first wave. Doctors, teachers, accountants will be next. Authoritarianism is as predictable as a Swiss train. It’s already later than you think.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Pink fishy goo makes bad news palatable | David Mitchell,"The shortage of taramasalata because of strike action is a cheery irritation amid a sea of gloomHave you ever asked yourself a question along the lines of: “If you had to choose not to eat bread or not to eat potatoes, what would you go for?”, or perhaps: “If you had to either never ever have a starter or never ever have a pudding, which would you pick?” You probably have. Maybe not while alone, but as part of some desultory group chat. Though perhaps you rise above it – these are very hypothetical scenarios, after all. Who exactly is going to say that forever after you can only have starters or puddings? Donald Trump? It doesn’t strike me as his style. Keir Starmer might float the idea since he’s so worried about the NHS, but then he’d pub-garden it within 48 hours. Perhaps you’ll develop type 2 diabetes and have to give up desserts but there won’t be any scope for bargaining. “I simply must have meringue but I’m willing to swear off paté and prawn cocktails in exchange” is not an argument any reputable doctor will accept.It’s diverting, though, in a bland way. If you’re at all interested in yourself, and it’s probably a mental health red flag if you’re not, you can’t help pondering it a bit. “Ooh, I love a roast potato, but instead of toast? That’s a poser. I think I’d have to keep toast.” That’s a little snippet from my own scintillating interior monologue, by the way. “Starters ahead of puddings. Every day of the week.” And there’s another. Like thinking about what you’d do if you ruled the world or won the lottery, it provokes harmless little explorations of what you’re like. “Do you know, I wouldn’t actually want it to be Christmas every day because then it wouldn’t be a treat,” you can proudly announce to yourself and any of the others in the chat. And hopefully there’s no rise-abover who’ll say: “Remind me, are we mortal or immortal, we humans? It’s mortal, isn’t it. We’re mortal. So what the hell is this?!” Continue reading...","Sun, 17 Nov 2024 10:00:06 GMT",-0.2263,0.9624
The Guardian,The Guardian view on the UK’s election challenges: an epidemic of intimidation | Editorial,"When more than half of candidates faced campaign abuse and threats, we are putting their safety at riskBritain’s election system is working well, and voters retain high levels of confidence in it. That’s the good news from a report this week from the independent Electoral Commission on this country’s 2024 general election. But now the bad news, because it is really serious. Look more closely, and it is clear that British elections face changing threats and challenges about which no one should be complacent.Easily the most disturbing part of the commission’s report deals with the increased level of abuse to which candidates and campaigners were subjected in the run-up to 4 July. The scale of the problem is staggering. More than half of all candidates who responded to the commission’s inquiries said they faced harassment, intimidation or abuse during the campaign. One-third said they were intentionally made to feel unsafe.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on the Booker prize winner: a whole new perspective | Editorial,"Samantha Harvey’s Orbital, a love letter to our wounded planet, is the perfect choice for the political moment“To look at the Earth from space is a bit like a child looking into a mirror and realising for the first time that the person in the mirror is herself. What we do to the Earth we do to ourselves,” the novelist and winner of this year’s Booker prize, Samantha Harvey, said in her acceptance speech last week.Orbital, the winning novel, gives us the view from space. Set on the International Space Station (ISS), it records one day from the perspectives of six&nbsp;astronauts. One day in space means 16 sunrises and 16 sunsets. Instead of the asteroids and aliens of&nbsp;science-fiction, here is the mundane routine of chores, meals and sleep. The characters’ backstories are glimpsed as briefly as passing stars. The only narrative propulsion is a typhoon threatening the Philippines. Nature replaces human drama as the novel’s focus.

The Guardian,"In Donald Trump, the morality of civil society has been abandoned","Limiting access to civic education in US schools leads people to be less well educated in basic principlesThe reason Donald Trump won is because he exemplifies men who think only of themselves. Civic responsibility is about caring for others, for everyone, not just oneself, and the easiest way to defeat democracy is to limit access to civic education, which is what has happened in the US public schools over the last 40 years.The people who support Trump are not less smart, but they are truly less well educated in these basic principles. It is this that makes it possible for them to abandon the morality of civil society. As for the women who support Trump, I am dumbfounded. All his supporters have voted against their own interests. They will lose their health care and there will be inflation due to tariffs that will make it even harder for them to make the mortgage.Margot Miller

The Guardian,Estrangement from a child is like a never-ending bereavement | Letters,"Readers respond to an article by Gaby Hinsliff told from people on both sides of family rifts, and share their own experiencesGaby Hinsliff’s article (‘I never want you around your grandchild’: the families torn apart when adult children decide to go ‘no contact’, 9 November) was a hard read, but a very welcome one given the increasing frequency of estrangement between parents and adult children. As parents who have been estranged for three years from our daughter, we too can testify to the sheer pain and sense of bereavement which occurs when estrangement happens out of the blue, and which is rightly highlighted in the article.Like others, we have followed the psychologist Joshua Coleman’s excellent guidance and observations very carefully in an attempt to try to come to terms with this horrible experience, and welcome the fact that he highlights the role of therapists. There are many excellent professional therapists out there. However, it is our belief that our daughter’s therapist succeeded at a stroke in bringing about the destruction of a previously loving and constant family relationship. This has also included our young grandchildren, who now must be heartbreakingly confused at the sudden loss of their grandparents from their lives.

The Guardian,Kane has been the defining player of a successful era but that has run its course | Barney Ronay,"England want to win the World Cup in two years’ time. They will not with a centre-forward who can no longer move There was an oddly heartbreaking moment with 87 minutes gone at Wembley, as Harry Kane was put through on goal with a chance to score his second of the night, made all the more tender by the fact he seemed so desperately keen to do exactly that with England already 5-0 up.Mainly it was heartbreaking because of the way Kane reached down to pump the accelerator, and just found nothing, a man suddenly running backwards through time, wind chimes tinkling. The finish was rushed and too close to the goalkeeper. Kane ended up flat on his face. He didn’t stop, passing and pointing and leading this team of tyros to the final whistle. Maybe he can wear his Bobby Charlton top next time and still take all the penalties. Continue reading...","Sun, 17 Nov 2024 21:53:40 GMT",0.34,-0.3995

The Guardian,"‘I’ve had a wild, chaotic, beautiful life’: Rebecca Hall on race, regrets and learning to be herself","Actor and director Rebecca Hall has always had to fight to define herself. Now, more comfortable than ever with where she is, she opens up about painting, working with Woody Allen, her BYO wedding – and her greatest indulgenceWe all thought that we knew Rebecca Hall – English rose, on stage since childhood, daughter of the Royal Shakespeare Company’s founder Sir Peter Hall, regularly described in Hollywood as one of the best actors of her generation. But in 2021 she took what she calls now “a big swing” and suddenly the whole story cracked in half.The big swing was her directorial debut, Passing, a film about two women of colour, one of whom is “passing” for white; Hall had been working on the story for 15 years, but thinking about it for far longer. Her maternal grandfather, a doorman from Detroit, passed as white, as did Hall’s mother the opera singer Maria Ewing, whose experience of growing up with internalised racism contributed to mental health issues that Hall had to navigate throughout her childhood. Her parents split when she was young and her mother brought her up alone in a grand country house in Sussex. But very little parenting was done – Hall (later head girl at school, later a Cambridge drop-out) was her mother’s caretaker. Because, “that kind of hiding [from who you are] leads to a certain amount of chaos. I think it’s safe to say that that stuff gets passed on. And I definitely grew up in an environment where my mother didn’t see me. She wanted me to be a certain kind of thing.” Continue reading...","Sun, 17 Nov 2024 07:00:02 GMT",-0.2023,0.719
The Guardian,Daniel Spoerri obituary,"Creator of ‘eat art’, which explored ideas of taste in a series of works that did not just reproduce food, but consisted of it In 2010, the year he turned 80, the artist Daniel Spoerri returned to Romania, the country he had left at the age of 12. Among his many discoveries was the local custom of picnicking in cemeteries. “Romanians eat with their dead,” Spoerri remarked in a 2015 biopic, gazing at a photograph he had brought back from his visit of a dining table next to a grave.The image might have been of one of his own works. In 1983, Spoerri had organised an al fresco dinner for 120 guests in a town outside Paris. As they ate, a nearby crane dug a trench the same size as the dining table. Halfway through the meal, diners were asked to remove their place settings – plates, glass and cutlery – and lower them into the 40-metre ditch, which was then filled in with earth. The performance was called Le Déjeuner sous l’Herbe, a play on the title of the famous Manet painting. Continue reading...","Sun, 17 Nov 2024 16:19:29 GMT",0.0,0.0772
The Guardian,Christmas Eve in Miller’s Point review – daringly dull Long Island family drama with nepo trimmings,"Francesca Scorsese and Sawyer Spielberg could be the draw in this tedium-rich tale of an Italian American festive gatheringThe prosaic anti-escapism of this sprawling American indie thoroughly subverts the expectations of the festive family movie. Christmas Eve in Miller’s Point is a mosaic portrait of an extended Italian American family gathered for their traditional seasonal celebration in Long Island. This may be the last year they do so: the suburban home of the ailing family matriarch is to be sold. Food is consumed, booze is swigged and the uncles bicker.Director Tyler Taormina (Ham on Rye) strings together a picture that seems to be 80% composed of establishing shots of tinsel and festive tat, punctuated by micro non-events and meandering conversations. It’s almost radical in its banality, capturing rather effectively the overstuffed inertia of a family Christmas and the simmering generational tensions. But Taormina’s all vibes, no story approach tests the patience.In UK and Irish cinemas Continue reading...","Sun, 17 Nov 2024 15:00:11 GMT",0.1027,0.3182

Now she has written a memoir documenting her remarkable storyIn March 2012, Lola Young, who sits as a crossbench peer in the House of Lords, clambered on to the rush-hour bus that would take her from the children’s social care office in Islington, north London, to her home. In her arms was a box: a collection of papers she was so anxious to open she did it there on the bottom deck of the number 38, spreading the pages precariously across her lap. Names, dates, brief notes about prams and the application of olive oil to infant skin…As the bus wove and lurched, Young read the story of the beginning of her life, and already there was so much to take in. On 30 July 1951, a baby with her name was, she learned, delivered to a Daisy Vince of 207 Tufnell Park Road – a baby that was then eight weeks old, rather than six, as she’d always been told. The traffic inched along, and as it did, she wondered… What difference does a fortnight make? None, probably. But if she’d been misinformed about this, there was surely more news to come.

But the Italian director Sergio Leone had such a poor grasp of English that, between takes, he would repeatedly rely on the words “watch me” before miming whatever he wanted from his leading man, Clint Eastwood, and his other actors.Now previously unpublished photographs show him doing just that, acting out particular scenes.

He wanted to study the proteins in our cells that help repair DNA and allow them to keep functioning, speculating that this could unlock secrets to new drugs.But even though Jackson was already a professor at the University of Cambridge, he was struggling to finance a crucial step in his research project.

With one in two of us in the UK likely to experience a form of the disease at some point in our lifetimes, it is understandable that certain fallacies can take hold within popular culture.However, such mistaken beliefs can impact the public perception of cancer for the worse, and in some cases even prevent patients from seeking the most recommended courses of treatment.

The Guardian,Lost your sense of direction? Turn off your phone and you’ll soon reconnect,"Tech giants said today’s digital native kids would be the first generation who would not know what it meant to get lost. But is that a good thing?We’ve lost direction and our brains are shrinking – at least, our hippocampi are. These seahorse-shaped parts of the brain measure about 5cm, sit just above both ears and drive our spatial awareness and orientation. London taxi drivers, famed for taking the Knowledge, a test that involves memorising the central streets of the capital, have full-sized hippocampi. But in 2011, neuroscientists at University College London discovered that the cabbies’ hippocampi shrunk significantly after retirement.The development of the hippocampus can also be stunted in childhood. Children living in urban environments rarely see the sun rise or set and cannot tell the difference between east and west. When I volunteered to go into my local school to teach kids about direction, I found they struggled to distinguish north from south and east from west – though they could do so if allowed to use their phones.

Sling Blade, the independent 1996 film he wrote, directed and starred, won him a best adapted screenplay Oscar – though his directing career went into hibernation after a difficult time adapting Cormac McCarthy’s All the Pretty Horses a few years later.

The Guardian,Trend watch: get ready for a country weekend,"Argyle knits and plaid coats, tweeds and wool… This season the heritage look is back. The aim? Off-duty royal at BalmoralFashion’s longstanding love of heritage and dressing up in the style of those attending country-house weekends has dominated the runways this season, from Chloé’s cape silhouette plaid coat to Wales Bonner’s check barn jacket styled over a dark tweed two piece. Meanwhile labels such as Margaret Howell and Stefan Cooke have adopted hardwearing tweed, styled with denim or paired with a knit, and heavy-duty wool trousers in a palette of autumn hues, from mustard, olive green and russet to rich chestnut brown. It’s a look suitable for long walks in the countryside, with textured wool coats layered over quilted and canvas barn jackets, such as Mango’s contrasting collar version (6, below) or Sezane’s flap pocket design in camel, £285.Knitwear is the foundation to this look, an argyle cardigan or jumper that’s reminiscent of Brideshead Revisited, the Mitford sisters and off-duty royals at Balmoral. The argyle knit is a great entry-point to this trend, and &amp;Daughter’s Ava sweater (£395), made in Hawick, Scotland, is the real deal, made with responsible Wool Standard-certified wool. On the high street, M&amp;S (10) has a simplified graphic take on the design (£35). There are also plenty of pre-loved iterations to be found, for example at Beyond Retro and eBay. For day, keep things practical with flat boots: Whistles lugsole knee-high pair (£259) have an equestrian vibe that works for the trend. Alternatively, Blundstone’s ankle boots (£190) come in a variety of colours and weather-appropriate finishes. Mixing textures and pattern is key, try checks with wool and throw in some embellishment to stay on the right side of cosplay. Continue reading...","Sat, 16 Nov 2024 23:55:52 GMT",0.3612,0.9349
The Guardian,"What a carve up! Playful, intricate Japanese leaf art – in pictures","Almost every day for the past five years, the Kanagawa-born artist Lito has drawn an image on to a leaf – usually a jaunty scene from the animal world involving, say, a biker-dude rabbit or a frog in a phone box – and carved it out with a scalpel before posting a photograph to social media. A painstaking process, it nonetheless suits Lito’s “propensity to devote long hours to detailed work” – a diagnosis of ADHD aged 30 was what prompted him to quit his corporate job and start carving leaves for a living. And a living it is: he’s sold 300,000 copies of his leaf-art books to date and exhibits his work throughout Japan. The combination of playful Studio Ghibli-esque imagination and exhaustive attention to detail is central to the appeal.See more on Instagram at lito_leafart Continue reading...","Sat, 16 Nov 2024 17:00:44 GMT",0.5848,0.7184
