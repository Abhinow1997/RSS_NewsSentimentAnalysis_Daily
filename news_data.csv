All the roles in it, however, have their equivalentsFor vulgar-minded Brits, a Hollywood film title sometimes carries its own unintended associations and unfortunate resonances. Many were pained at the raucous response from some here in 2017 to the title of Robert Redford’s earnest film Our Souls at Night. Now here is a moderate new piece of Netflix product, a thriller about a bomb smuggled on to a plane in hand-baggage, starring Taron Egerton as Ethan, the airport security officer in a tense situation and Jason Bateman as the sinister explosives mastermind. It’s called … Carry-On.That title is self-explanatory for everyone in the United States. But it’s bound to get British Netflix subscribers very overexcited, assuming as they surely will that the greatest movie franchise in the history of cinema is about to be rebooted with a sexy new cast. Egerton is a Brit. Couldn’t he have warned Netflix that the film ought possibly to have been retitled for the UK? Continue reading...","Sat, 14 Dec 2024 00:00:01 GMT",0.1027,0.9093

Here’s how to maximise your morning commute or weekend ramblePhysical activity doesn’t need to be complicated. Even just a brisk, 10-minute daily walk can deliver a host of health benefits, lowering the risk of several diseases, including heart disease, stroke and several cancers.By making a few small changes to the way you walk it’s possible to transform this simple everyday activity, making it even more beneficial for your health.

The Guardian,Can billionaire media moguls be trusted in Trump’s America? | Emily Bell,"The new gatekeepers use ‘trust’ to discredit the press and talk about removing bias with AI - distracting us from their own shift to the rightIf we want to know what news organisations will look like under the second Trump administration in America, well, we are beginning to get an idea. At the Dealbook conference in New York last week, Jeff Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post and multi-billionaire founder of Amazon, gave a very favourable assessment of Donald Trump’s upcoming second term. “I am very hopeful … he seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation,” beamed Bezos. It was surprising, then, that the Washington Post did not endorse Trump in its pre-election editorial. Instead the writers crafted an endorsement of Democratic candidate Kamala Harris which Bezos killed, in his first act of blatant editorial interference since he bought the title in 2013. In a Post article Bezos rationalised his decision as being an attempt to restore trust in the press with what he called “independence” – a type of independence which clearly does not extend to damping down public flattery. The headline, run with Bezos’s approval, was ‘The Hard Truth: Why Americans Don’t Trust the News Media’. Bezos invoked the past of the American press, its historic non-endorsement of candidates and a return to some past notion of “objectivity” as being a fix for his news organisation’s woes.Patrick Soon-Shiong, the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Times, had already emulated Bezos by stopping the LA Times editorial board from running a presidential endorsement. Soon-Shiong, appearing on the Republican commentator Scott Jennings’ radio show, said that he had been working on an AI-powered “bias meter” which will appear on LA Times articles from January. The motivation was that the medical tech billionaire said he had begun to see his own news title as “an echo chamber and not a trusted source”.

As a tidal wave of accountability continues to sweep the industry, the fallout from Sean “Diddy” Combs’s arrest continues to dredge up even more alleged horror stories. This time, it’s Jay-Z who is in the hot seat after an amended lawsuit filed in federal court this week alleged that he and Diddy took turns raping an unnamed 13-year-old girl during a VMAs afterparty that Diddy hosted in 2000.

One need not possess the telepathic powers of Professor Charles Xavier to consider this a fact. That said, the heterodox, ostensibly incoherent potpourri of political views expressed by the alleged UnitedHealthcare CEO assassin, Luigi Mangione, is more representative of the average American than many elites would care to admit.Mangione’s Twitter/X account is a kaleidoscopic fever dream with no clear ideological rudder. It seems he has a genuine interest in health and wellness. “Wokeness” and masculinity are occasionally discussed; so too are climate change, psychedelics and the potential risks and rewards of artificial intelligence. Pornography, in Mangione’s mind, “should be regulated no less than alcohol, cigarettes, and travel” – and certain sex toys should be banned. He likes Joe Rogan but disdains Jordan Peterson. He also appears to be particularly fond of Pokémon, baby elephants, gorillas and Japan’s Indigenous religion, Shintoism. Continue reading...","Fri, 13 Dec 2024 10:06:43 GMT",0.0,0.762

One of its advanced behaviours appears to be self-preservation. In testing, when the system was led to believe it would be shut down, it attempted to disable an oversight mechanism. When “o1” found memos about its replacement, it tried copying itself and overwriting its core code. Creepy? Absolutely.More realistically, the move probably reflects the system’s programming to optimise outcomes rather than demonstrating intentions or awareness. The idea of creating intelligent machines induces feelings of unease. In computing this is the gorilla problem: 7m years ago, a now-extinct primate evolved, with one branch leading to gorillas and one to humans. The concern is that just as gorillas lost control over their fate to humans, humans might lose control to superintelligent AI. It is not obvious that we can control machines that are smarter than us.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Christmas shows: they are fairy tales for our times,"From Ballet Shoes to Wicked, stories of female empowerment and friendship are triumphing on stage and screen“I’d start with Ballet Shoes first. It’s my favourite,” Meg Ryan’s character urges a mother in a bookstore in Nora Ephron’s 1998 romantic comedy You’ve Got Mail. Never out of print since it was first published in 1936, Noel Streatfield’s “Story of Three Children on the Stage” has been a favourite with generations of readers, including former Children’s Laureate Jacqueline Wilson. Although adapted twice for television, Ballet Shoes has never been made into a play before. This Christmas, the National Theatre in London is staging it for the first time.Three foundling girls – Pauline, Petrova and Posy – fetch up at a dilapidated house on the Cromwell Road some time in the 1920s, having been rescued by roving palaeontologist Great Uncle Matthew – “Gum”. Left in the care of his adult niece Sylvia (another orphan) and her old nanny, the girls become the Fossil sisters. They grow up in a spirited matriarchy of genteel poverty and plucky determination to follow their passions – acting, engineering and ballet. Described by Streatfield as “a fairy story with its feet halfway on the ground”, Ballet Shoes is the perfect tale for our own age of austerity.

The Guardian,What Labour can do to defeat the fantasy politics of populism | Letters,"John Chowcat says voters need a personal stake in democracy, while Stephen Coleman looks at why people turn to the magical thinking of demagogues. Plus letters from Anthony Papadopoulos, Colleen Molloy and Rodney BarkerJonathan Freedland’s stark warning is justified (We cannot afford for Starmer’s government to fail. Because Farage is lying in wait, 6 December). A resurgent narrow nationalism, blaming immigrants for the UK’s squeezed living standards and underfunded public services, could replace Labour in office if Starmer’s growth strategy falters over the next few years. Donald Trump’s protectionism and corporate tax cuts could shortly attract yet more overseas investment to an already strong US economy, further weakening economic recovery here.Labour does need to demonstrate practical improvements that voters will recognise. A closely related deep problem also requires attention. A period of economic pessimism and disillusionment with conventional British politics makes many people feel powerless, unable to control their destinies – a sentiment often manipulated by hard-right nativists promoting social division. To counter this, voters need a personal stake in democracy, through genuine experience of collective debate and&nbsp;real public accountability.

His cheeks are red, his eyes are wet. “I’m quite emotional, always have been,” he says. “I don’t know why. Maybe it’s my upbringing, middle child, the-forgotten-about-one, I don’t know. No one ever gave me anything. I used to argue with the sports psychologist, they always told you: ‘Emotion clouds judgment’. Well it might well do, sunshine, but let me tell you, when you’re binding up for a scrum and you’re a-metre-and-a-half apart and you’ve got something over there, a tonnage, who wants to fucking eat you, you need to be emotional. If you ain’t, there’s something wrong with you.”Retirement has been hard on Vickery. He used that emotional energy as fuel when he was a player. These days he sometimes seems to be at a loss to know what to do with it. It’s been 14 years since his last match, he was at it 20 years, won 73 England caps and five more for the British &amp; Irish Lions. He still carries the wounds. Some he has been able to fix, others he is still working on, some you can see some, others you only hear. He has been through a divorce, a bankruptcy, and has spent a lot of time struggling with his mental health. He is phlegmatic about it, but there is a hell of a lot of hurt in him.

The Guardian,Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend,"A Manchester derby at a bad time for both teams, managers with shared values and Forest’s European dreamSean Dyche may be struggling to find reasons for optimism before his Everton side travel to Arsenal. The Toffees used to be tricky opponents for Mikel Arteta, earning wins under Carlo Ancelotti and Rafael Benítez. Dyche enjoyed a 1-0 win at Goodison in his first meeting with Arsenal as Everton manager, but has lost their three encounters since. Everton’s only win on the road this season came at Ipswich in October – also the last time they scored away from home – while Arteta’s side are on a 14-game unbeaten run at the Emirates. Dyche can be forgiven for having one eye on the January transfer window, saying on Thursday that the Friedkin Group’s proposed takeover “is looking very possible … but, until it’s done, it’s not done.” Whatever the result on Saturday, we can expect set-piece goals. Arsenal have scored a league-high 23 goals from corners since the start of last season, while 57% of Everton’s goals this term have come from set pieces.Arsenal v Everton, Saturday 3pm (all times GMT)Liverpool v Fulham, Saturday 3pmNewcastle v Leicester, Saturday 3pmWolves v Ipswich, Saturday 3pm Continue reading...","Fri, 13 Dec 2024 08:59:11 GMT",0.0,0.9169

The Guardian,September 5 review – taut media procedural revisits Munich Olympics,"Journalists take centre stage in Tim Fehlbaum’s tense thriller focusing on 1972’s infamous terrorist massacre through a TV crew lensThe story of the 1972 Munich Olympics terrorist massacre – in which 11 Israeli hostages were killed by the Palestinian Black September group, dying along with five of members of the group and one West German police officer – is retold by the Swiss director and co-writer Tim Fehlbaum as a taut, tense thriller. The film leaves it up to us to make what we will of modern parallels.The situation is reinvented as a kind of media procedural, shown purely from the viewpoint of ABC TV’s sports division, who from their cramped, claustrophobic gallery found themselves in sole charge of broadcasting the events live to the world. The crew is seen wheeling a cumbersome studio camera in range of the athletes’ village to capture images, quarrelling with other American TV companies about satellite-feed space. They’re under pressure to make unchecked statements to make sure their rivals didn’t get the scoop, making split-second editorial decisions with zero news experience while grimacing at the banks of TV screens like Houston Mission Control watching Apollo 13. And they were only aware too late that they were directly influencing what was happening, on the edge of panic at the responsibility and the sheer postmodern nightmare of what was happening.

The Guardian,"Angel Olsen: Cosmic Waves Vol 1 review – intriguing half compilation, half covers","(somethingscosmic)Five rising artists each perform one of their songs, then the US singer-songwriter covers another one of their tracks in a set of woebegone eleganceAngel Olsen’s last album was 2022’s country-tinged, grief-wrought Big Time; a stopgap EP, Forever Means, came out in 2023. Cosmic Waves Volume 1 feels like the work of an artist buying more time, but in a good way – investing in community via her own bijou label. This compilation amplifies five lesser-known artists and provides a welcome instalment of Olsen’s classic, haunted balladeering. A “compilation reimagined as a dialogue”, Cosmic Waves showcases those five acts on the A-side, with Olsen covering one each of their tracks on the B-side.Her selections centre mostly on LA, and zigzag from the spirited, goth grunge of Poppy Jean Crawford (Glamorous) to the Talking Heads bent of Coffin Prick, the most sonically adventurous player here. You can hear parallels between the whirrs of his work and Olsen’s own cavernous resonances. From Camp Saint Helene and erstwhile actor Sarah Grace White come sounds that translate more immediately into Olsen’s plangent retro makeovers. The all-Olsen half stands alone as an EP of woebegone elegance. She has toured and duetted with Maxim Ludwig, and while his track is standard man-at-piano fare, Olsen’s version of his Born Too Blue, with its easy classicism, is a standout here.

For most of this time it is what I thought I wanted, but the closer it gets, the more trepidation I have. I used to put up with behaviours from people that I didn’t really like, but kept relationships going for fear of what would happen if I ended them. I’m not that person any more.I left my husband of 25 years a decade ago and have dropped many friends who I feel no longer give me what I need, who I was “people pleasing” – doing what they wanted to my detriment. I love my partner very much. He is a good, kind, caring man who adores me. But I’m so scared that suddenly I’ll “go off” him like I have other people and that I’ll be stuck living with someone I don’t want to be around. I know I sound dismissive of people. But I have cultivated my own space, my own understanding of my needs and wants. I eventually went off my husband. I don’t want to go off my partner too. How can I be at peace and not be scared of him moving in? It would be positive in so many ways. Continue reading...","Thu, 12 Dec 2024 23:00:29 GMT",0.6956,0.9885

The Guardian,‘The water war’: how drought threatens survival of Sicily’s towns,"Amid Italian island’s worst drought, towns such as Troina are fighting for survival as supplies run dry and tensions riseAn ancient Sicilian proverb goes like this: “When water to two fountains flows, one will stay dry – that’s how it goes.” The residents of the small town of Troina in the heart of Sicily, struck by a long and unprecedented drought, perhaps understand its meaning better than anyone else. When authorities decreed that the little water left in their dam should be shared with the villages of another province, they took action, and, on 30 November, occupied the distribution centre of the reservoir, blocking access.“It’s a war between the poor; we are aware of it,” says Salvatore Giamblanco, 66, owner of a bed and breakfast in Troina. “But we had no other choice. The dam is drying up. We have difficulty finding water for ourselves. I had to cancel numerous reservations due to the lack of water. If we also have to share what little we have with other towns, we will all be left dry.” Continue reading...","Fri, 13 Dec 2024 10:00:43 GMT",-0.3818,-0.9274

But at a public funeral for Mazen al-Hamadah – before his disappearance in 2020 one of the most vocal survivors of torture in the regime’s prisons system – the joy gave way to sorrow, as the country begins to grapple with the fact that many of the estimated 130,000 people missing may be lost forever.Thousands of people flooded the streets on Thursday, following Hamadah’s body, wrapped in a traditional white shroud, as it was driven slowly from a hospital to the Abdulrahman Abu al Ouf mosque for funeral prayers. At a vigil afterwards in nearby al-Hijaz square, thousands of men, women and children cried and hugged each other, many carrying pictures of their own disappeared loved ones.

The communications of government officials in Washington DC have been intercepted, as have internet browsing records kept by the same telecommunications companies.

The Guardian,"The cochlear question: as the parent of a deaf baby, should I give her an implant to help her hear?","Cochlear implantation is controversial in ways that parallel medical situations – such as artificial limbs and cornea transplants – are not. Why does this issue provoke such fierce debate?This essay first appeared under the title The Cochlear Question on Aeon.coI knew my daughter could hear: not just because she loved music, but because she had perfect rhythm. She punched her fists in the air like a human metronome, and brought a doughy heel to the ground precisely on each downbeat. I had thrown off the yoke of milestone-tracking months earlier, having become fixated on her inability to roll during the precise developmental week for rolling. So when she didn’t form consonants at the prescribed time, I made a deliberate choice to ignore it. It didn’t occur to me that deafness might not be a binary, and that certain vibrations and pitches – the downbeat of a song by toddler-music group the Wiggles, say – could be apprehended, while other subtle speech sounds might be snatched out of a sentence. So it was a couple of months after her first birthday when we discovered that our Botticellian baby had mild hearing loss, and two years after that when she lost almost all of her remaining hearing entirely.Like most hearing parents of deaf children, my first close relationship with a deaf person was with my child. Despite a relatively broad cultural education, I knew next to nothing about hearing loss or deaf culture. What little I had absorbed was an incomplete and almost entirely inaccurate patchwork of pop culture snippets – the mother’s horror when her baby doesn’t react to the fire engine’s siren in the film Mr Holland’s Opus (1995); Beethoven’s struggle to hear the first performance of his Ninth Symphony; the lift scene in Jerry Maguire (1996) where the loving boyfriend signs “you complete me” to his partner; Quasimodo’s apparent industrial deafness from the bells of Notre-Dame; and, worst of all, the appalling memory of my university housemate imitating a deaf accent for laughs. This bleak landscape of ignorance and misinformation is often the lookout from which parents begin making decisions, as deaf critics have rightly pointed out. But although I began educating myself belatedly, it didn’t take long for the calcified layers of assumptions and approximations to disintegrate. Chief among them was the unquestioned belief that hearing loss, for an early deafened person, is even a loss at all. Continue reading...","Wed, 11 Dec 2024 23:59:02 GMT",0.4019,-0.9734

That’s what residents of southern Florida have been struggling with for the past few decades, with the rapid growth of the Burmese python population in the Everglades.In a recent study in Reptiles and Amphibians, a team of researchers considered the maximal gape of three Burmese pythons – in other words, they measured how wide the snakes could open their mouths. The smallest of the pythons had been found consuming a 35kg deer.
