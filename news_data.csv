You have done more than enough for herEvery week Annalisa Barbieri addresses a problem sent in by a readerMy mother has led a hard life. Diagnosed with clinical depression many years ago, she has made multiple “suicide attempts”, ranging from when I was aged nine to the last one 12 years ago when I was 31. I’m an only child, unmarried, and my mum did not marry after my dad left her. She did find love when I was 11, but her parents forbade her to pursue it, so she focused on her career.Mum’s suicide attempts were often linked to control issues: a reaction to me dating or not toeing the line. When I graduated from college and moved to a different city, my mother asked me to return home on a work-from-home arrangement, and the tussles continued, with my aunt (who has not worked since her early 30s) being equally controlling.

The story begins with one picture. Specifically, a James Van Der Zee picture of a young couple dressed in raccoon fur coats and posing with their Cadillac V-16 Roadster in Harlem. Everything is gleaming. It’s the ultimate aspirational image.But this picture was taken 1932, the era of racial segregation in America. Slavery had been abolished 67 years previously but anti-black racism, including lynching, was rife, and rural southerners flocked to northern cities to escape it. Harlem, New York, was in the throes of its renaissance, as Black culture from jazz to literature flourished. The unnamed couple in the photograph, solemn and proud, embody that movement’s gumption, what Tina M Campt has called the ability of Black artists to “twin pain, trauma, loss, with Black people’s virtuosity in survival, and the capacity to inhabit tremendous joy in spite of all these things.” Continue reading...","Fri, 15 Nov 2024 17:25:13 GMT",0.0,-0.7016

And there was such tension within his family around Brexit – seeing how it drove a wedge between them&nbsp;was really quite stark.”Tannahill and his partner were living in a flat by London City Airport, where the planes taking off would create “this low, reverberant sound that was just ever present”. The writer was also starting to chafe against the confines of his relationship. “I had so many desires: I wanted to be out all night dancing with others in this kind of libidinal state of release at a rave.” He also had an urge to explore London’s fetish scene. “I think Claire’s journey is one that mirrored my own,” Tannahill says. “She’s seeking the collective ecstatic.” Continue reading...","Fri, 15 Nov 2024 13:00:09 GMT",0.7506,-0.7269

But they can’t, which is why Eva Longoria has announced she no longer lives in America. “I get to escape and go somewhere,” she explained. “Most Americans aren’t so lucky – they’re going to be stuck in this dystopian country.” What’s brought this on, apart from the obvious? “Whether it’s the homelessness or the taxes … it just feels like this chapter in my life is done now.” Great to learn that Eva dislikes both homelessness and taxes.

Donald Trump really does want to rule as an extremist strongman, with contempt for the planet, for America’s allies and for the rule of law. He’s made that crystal clear this week, announcing one bombshell appointment after another, each one a declaration of intent. Few things tell you more about a president than their hires – personnel is policy, as they used to say in Ronald Reagan’s White House – and Trump is telling us exactly who he is.The latest name added to the roster is a storied one: Robert F Kennedy Jr, now lined up for the role of health secretary. You may have known of Bobby Kennedy. Bobby Kennedy may be a hero of yours. But, boy, his son is no Bobby Kennedy. Once an admired environmental campaigner, now he is an anti-vaxxer conspiracy theorist who promotes treatments that don’t work – such as hydroxychloroquine for Covid – and rails against those that do, spreading the long-debunked claim that childhood vaccines are linked to autism and opposing fluoridation of water to prevent tooth decay. Apparently unchastened by the pandemic, Kennedy believes US public health officials have been too focused on infectious diseases. Or as he memorably put it: “We’re going to give infectious disease a break for about eight years.” If deadly pathogens could lick their lips, they would.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","Fri, 15 Nov 2024 17:42:33 GMT",-0.4588,0.5483

Yet he has chosen to seal his legacy as Israel’s tepid enablerWhen the histories of his administration are written, it will be clear that Joe Biden held on to his callous disregard for Palestinians until the end of his presidency. How else to explain why Biden would refuse a final chance to stop Israel’s brutal war on Gaza and save Palestinian lives, when he has nothing to lose?On Tuesday, the Biden administration quietly ignored its own deadline for Israel to increase the minuscule amount of humanitarian aid it allows to enter Gaza. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, imposed the 30-day deadline in a letter sent to Israeli officials on 13 October, which warned that they must take “concrete measures” to ensure that Palestinian civilians in northern Gaza have access to food, medicine and other necessities. The administration said it could suspend US military support to Israel if conditions did not improve. Despite the US ultimatum, the amount of aid reaching the besieged territory in October had dropped to its lowest level in 11 months.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian center for Near Eastern studies, and a journalism professor at New York University Continue reading...","Fri, 15 Nov 2024 18:04:03 GMT",0.0772,-0.7101

Most witnesses to the inquiry have begun by saying how sorry they are for the scandal, even if they have later been at pains to point out it was nothing to do with them. There was no such statement from Kemi. She is not one of Westminster’s natural empaths. Rather, she wanted to make clear she had done all she could to expedite things by writing to Jeremy Hunt suggesting that he offer £100k to all claimants. Despite the then chancellor turning her down on the grounds that it might not offer a fair deal to taxpayers, Kemi placed the blame for the holdups on the civil service. Nor could Kemi explain why she made no subsequent efforts to free up compensation over the following 12 months. Not even another letter.

The Guardian,We warned the Democratic party that disaster was coming. They didn’t listen | Dustin Guastella,"Can they change course? Maybe, but they need a message of commonsense solidarity without liberal elitism Before the election it was clear that Kamala Harris’s closing message was not landing with working-class voters. The Center for Working Class Politics (CWCP) sounded the alarm that the Democrats could be heading for a disaster. And last Tuesday, disaster struck.Harris lost badly. She resoundingly lost the electoral college (226 to 312 as of publication), and she lost the critical blue-wall states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Democrats even lost the popular vote for the first time in 20 years. In short, Harris lost the working class. Continue reading...","Fri, 15 Nov 2024 11:00:09 GMT",-0.5423,-0.9559

It’s distasteful to compare extreme human suffering. But we can use the international metrics for famine to explain why each humanitarian crisis is uniquely terrible – and why people caught in both need urgent action.Sudan is the largest food crisis in the world by the sheer numbers affected. The country’s warring generals can immediately end the worst hunger by agreeing to a ceasefire and facilitating humanitarian aid.

The Guardian,A British export the US didn’t need: a cosy relationship between editor and proprietor | Zoe Williams,"The Washington Post’s Will Lewis said the paper was returning to its ‘roots’ by not endorsing a presidential candidate. There was more to it than thatPostmortems continue for who lost Kamala Harris the US election, and these will be consequential for the left in the UK. However many times the US flags that the “special relationship” is really not a thing for them any more, their politics bears down on ours, whether it’s rightwing narratives travelling from the Heritage Foundation to the thinktanks at Tufton Street, via [checks notes], oh yes, money, or the centre left here praying they can sail past the Democrats’ shipwrecks.If consensus is reached that the problem was “go woke; go broke” – that Harris was too inclusive, too pro-trans, too pro-diversity, generally speaking, not horrible enough – that would be multiple kinds of erroneous, the greatest of which is moral. It lacks backbone to diagnose the problem as “too strong on the values of humanity and universalism”, and solve it by abandoning those values. Amusingly, the message Labour has taken, so far, isn’t even that the Dems were too woke – rather, that they were just too hopeful, a reading which is a little like avoiding the shipwreck by drowning yourself.Zoe Williams is a Guardian journalist Continue reading...","Fri, 15 Nov 2024 12:01:01 GMT",0.0,0.8987
The Guardian,The Guardian view on UN climate talks: rich and poor nations can strike a win-win deal | Editorial,"At Cop29 the global south needs to unite for sustainable growth, leveraging resources and negotiating transformative climate finance pactsMore than a century of burning coal, oil and gas has fuelled intense heatwaves, prolonged droughts, heavier rains and devastating floods. To prevent even more severe impacts, the UN global climate summit, Cop29, must deliver tangible results to keep global temperature rises below 2C – the limit defined in the 2015 Paris agreement. Achieving this goal means human societies can only emit a finite amount of additional carbon dioxide, known as the world’s “carbon budget”.Developed nations have exceeded their carbon budgets, while developing countries remain within theirs. Carbon dioxide lingers in the atmosphere for centuries, turning past unchecked fossil fuel use into a costly planetary bill. Between 1870 and 2019, the US, EU, Russia, UK, Japan, Canada and Australia – home to just 15% of the global population – accounted for over 60% of atmospheric carbon dioxide, according to the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment.

The Guardian,The Guardian view on Testing times: Cricket’s traditions are being clean bowled by cash | Editorial,"Old-school charm faces off against big-money leagues, as short-form tournaments threaten to sideline the  old orderTwo cricketing worlds collide next week. Australia and India meet on Friday in Perth in the opening Test of what promises to be an epic encounter –&nbsp;the first five-match series between the two great rivals since 1991-92. Five-match Test series used to be the norm. However, with the exception of England&nbsp;v&nbsp;Australia, they have become rare. One‑day cricket, and&nbsp;especially&nbsp;Twenty20, has eroded the time&nbsp;available&nbsp;for the longest form of the game, forcing&nbsp;series to be shortened to three or even two matches. What used to be a novel lasting all summer has become a novella, over in a trice. But in this Australian summer, something like tradition again rules. Five Tests spread over a month and a half, with the Christmas and new year Tests in Melbourne and Sydney in their time‑honoured place.The new cricket world, however, won’t let tradition dominate. Just two days after the Perth Test begins, the Indian Premier League (IPL) “mega-auction” will unfold in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, underscoring the desert kingdom’s growing influence in global sports. Ten IPL franchises will bid on 574 players competing for 204 slots, alongside 46 already retained.&nbsp;In total, 250 players will take part in the two‑month 2025 IPL season next spring.

The Guardian,Estrangement from a child is like a never-ending bereavement | Letters,"Readers respond to an article by Gaby Hinsliff told from people on both sides of family rifts, and share their own experiencesGaby Hinsliff’s article (‘I never want you around your grandchild’: the families torn apart when adult children decide to go ‘no contact’, 9 November) was a hard read, but a very welcome one given the increasing frequency of estrangement between parents and adult children. As parents who have been estranged for three years from our daughter, we too can testify to the sheer pain and sense of bereavement which occurs when estrangement happens out of the blue, and which is rightly highlighted in the article.Like others, we have followed the psychologist Joshua Coleman’s excellent guidance and observations very carefully in an attempt to try to come to terms with this horrible experience, and welcome the fact that he highlights the role of therapists. There are many excellent professional therapists out there. However, it is our belief that our daughter’s therapist succeeded at a stroke in bringing about the destruction of a previously loving and constant family relationship. This has also included our young grandchildren, who now must be heartbreakingly confused at the sudden loss of their grandparents from their lives.

The Guardian,Freddie Steward’s selection can strengthen England in defence and in attack | Ugo Monye,"Steve Borthwick’s team always kick a lot but they must use the ball well to have a chance against these brilliant South AfricansThe kicking duel is going to be pivotal at Twickenham on Saturday. South Africa have said they’ve been expecting it all along and it’s what they’re going to get. Over to England – don’t disappoint. It might not be as aesthetically pleasing, maybe the impetus to win becomes greater as a result, but the thinking is obvious if you cast back to last year’s World Cup semi-final.I understand the selection of Freddie Steward, that Steve Borthwick genuinely believes selecting someone who is 6ft 5in and whose point of difference is his aerial strength gives England the best chance of beating South Africa. I also understand that World Rugby’s clampdown on escorts is increasing the number of contestable kicks and is having an impact on these autumn Tests. I also have a feeling that England are using the latter to almost excuse the former. In the 2023 Six Nations, England averaged 40 kicks again, which was the most of all countries. Earlier this year it was 30, the same as in New Zealand over the summer, but the point here is that England kick a lot and have done for a while. A directive that encourages kicking would appear to suit them yet they seem to be outwardly disappointed about it, perhaps in the knowledge that adopting that sort of style will not be universally well received.

The Guardian,Ireland hold off Argentina’s fightback after making rapid start,"Ireland 22-19 ArgentinaThree first-half tries enough for Andy Farrell’s sideJeopardy is a word with plenty of currency in rugby these days. Mostly it is used in reference to how competitions are structured, but also in describing individual matches. This one had plenty. Not always evident, especially in the first half when Ireland looked a good deal better than against the All Blacks a week ago. But the race down the home straight, with Argentina a man down, had heaps of it. When at last the pressure was relieved for the home team pretty much all of them called the knock on. And then gave thanks for deliverance.That’s what it was. Coincidentally it is 25 years since a long night in Lens when a different sort of finish changed rugby in both countries. Bizarrely it was better for both, albeit for Ireland that bonus was a long time coming. Losing on the night turned into winning in the long run.

He moved like a young man on a mission, which it turned out he was. They embraced and when Huijsen finally walked off he was wearing white, a No 14 on the back.It had been that kind of night, a familiarity and a sort of mutual admiration about the place, something of themselves seen in each other. Something shared, and not just, as it turned out, the scoreline. At the end, ball boys holding camera phones had run on seeking out Jobe Bellingham, who had played over an hour on his U21 debut, while players from each side made their way towards familiar faces, of which there were many.

The Guardian,Post your questions for Billy Bob Thornton,"The Oscar-winning actor, writer, director, musician and star of Bad Santa, Armageddon and The Man Who Wasn’t There is ready to answer your questionsWhat is Billy Bob Thornton’s most iconic role? Some may say the taciturn barber in the Coen brothers’ The Man Who Wasn’t There, others might contend it’s the learning disabled killer in his early film Sling Blade. But we all know the truth: it’s the sex-addicted alcoholic Father Christmas in Bad Santa who is obsessed with the “three Bs” (look it up, this is a family publication).Be that as it may, Thornton has had a stellar Hollywood career since emerging in the mid-90s. Sling Blade, the independent 1996 film he wrote, directed and starred, won him a best adapted screenplay Oscar – though his directing career went into hibernation after a difficult time adapting Cormac McCarthy’s All the Pretty Horses a few years later. However, he became a stalwart of mainstream and independent acting in that period, with roles in Armageddon, A Simple Plan and Monster’s Ball.

The Guardian,"‘Take anything, but please not my voice!’: the Royal Opera’s Sound Voice Project","In a space that usually rings with opera, a poignant and moving video installation examines the intimate connection between our voices and our selvesA child speaks into total darkness: “This is my voice.” Clear articulation, delivery just slightly hurried. As we descend in a huddle through the auditorium of the Linbury theatre, other voices – older, more obviously gendered – speak the same refrain. Some sound confident (“this is my voice”, trumpets one), others less so. Some overlap, speaking almost in chorus. All are unmistakably individual.Three scrims hang in the main performance space. “What does it mean to have a voice?” The question appears silently, white type on black fabric. “And what does it mean to lose it?” In the week that Google has released Gemini Live, an AI voice assistant that allows users to have “natural conversations” with its chatbot, and months after Afghan women responded to the Taliban outlawing female voices in public by posting videos of themselves singing, such issues are critical. But in a space that often rings with the sound of highly trained operatic voices, audience chatter and critical opinion, the questions posed by The Sound Voice Project’s immersive installation are unusually self-conscious.

The Guardian,Daisy Ridley’s Rey is now Star Wars’ best big-screen bet – is this a saga without a plan?,"Why would the franchise want to go back to the post-Rise of Skywalker era, when all the interesting action in the Star Wars universe is occurring in the timeline of The Mandalorian?When the Fight Club author Chuck Palahniuk described modern consumer culture as “a copy of a copy of a copy”, he was probably thinking of Ikea churning out coffee tables with all the personality of an overcooked noodle, rather than the next episodes in a long-running space opera known for heroes who use quizzically reversed syntax. Nevertheless, he might easily have been talking about Star Wars, and the once great saga’s descent into self parody in the wake of reports from Hollywood that the future of the franchise on the big screen is to be based on ... yep, you read it right ... Daisy Ridley’s Rey.
 It had already been announced that Rey, whose presence lent the sequel trilogy all the emotional resonance of a damp tea towel, will return for a movie set 15 years after the events of the execrable Rise of Skywalker, as she endeavours to build a new Jedi order. (Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy is attached to direct.) That was worrying enough for those fans of the saga still reeling from the most recent episode’s attempts to tie up loose ends by lighting them on fire and hoping nobody noticed. But according to the Hollywood Reporter, Lucasfilm has decided that Rey is now seen as Star Wars’ “most valuable cinematic asset” – admittedly because “the closet is a little bare” following the deaths either on or off screen of pretty much the entire cast of the original trilogy.It’s hard to argue with this – except to point out that if Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker and Harrison Ford’s Han Solo are no longer available for new Star Wars adventures in the current timeline, it is almost completely Disney and Lucasfilm’s fault for killing them off in the first place. However there are solutions that would allow both characters to return in other, earlier eras, as has already taken place to greater and lesser success in the Mandalorian and Boba Fett TV series (in which Hamill appeared via motion-capture technology as a brilliantly de-aged take on Luke) and the middling movie Solo, which tried and failed to recast the role of the galaxy’s most sardonic Corellian smuggler. Sadly, Carrie Fisher’s Leia is probably lost to us for ever following the actor’s death in 2016, but even here there is some hope, given the character appeared in a youthful incarnation in the same year’s Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.Reports emerged last week that the new Star Wars trilogy is being shepherded by writer-producer Simon Kinberg, who is perhaps best known for 20th Century Fox’s mercurial X-Men films of the 2000s. According to the Hollywood Reporter’s sources, Rey will play some kind of role, which suggests the films will be set in the period post Rise of Skywalker. This seems bizarre, given that all the interesting Star Wars stuff right now is happening in the post-original trilogy era occupied by The Mandalorian and the forthcoming big-screen entry The Mandalorian and Grogu, directed by Jon Favreau. In this context, returning the Star Wars timeline to the period following the Emperor’s second (and far more tedious) demise feels like dragging it back to a plot that’s been vacuum-sealed in fan indifference while the real action is off somewhere sipping blue milk with Baby Yoda.

Well, make that servers plural, because they are legion here.This place is a collaboration between chef Chris Denney, formerly of Fiend and 108 Garage, and George Bukhov-Weinstein and Ilya Demichev, the pair who in 2014 caused chaos on the London dining scene when they opened Beast, a similarly Bram Stoker-ish spot in a crypt that served only gigantic king crab, steak and chunks of aged parmesan with rocket.
