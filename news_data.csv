His commercial and political connections to both may prove pivotal as the feud between the US and China plays out over the next four years, particularly as Trump promises steep tariffs.Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, once supported Joe Biden. But his relationship with the current US president soured over the past four years as, among other insults, Musk felt that the White House gave Telsa, his car and green energy company, “the cold shoulder”. Trump, meanwhile, has described Tesla as “incredible” even while pledging to do away with subsidies for electric vehicles.

When the publishers blurb on the back that this is an “astonishing real-life political thriller”, do they mean its facts are as lurid as fiction, or are they trying to gloss the account as fiction to avert legal challenge?

Over a cup of tea, Corrina Chapman asked if he would take her family’s portrait and then spent the next 10 minutes calling everyone. Parents, uncles, cousins and lots of kids trickled into the caravan until about 12 people were crammed inside. In the chaos, Wright, who had recently become a father, took one of his favourite images, of a man holding a baby; capturing a tender side to Travellers not often seen in the media.The photographer, whose great-grandmother was of Traveller heritage, wanted to create “a new and more honest portrayal” of the community, who have been caricatured and criminalised for decades. Before photographing the series, Wright had heard the flippantly racist comments Travellers face, being warned that they might be hostile or steal his equipment. But that couldn’t have been further from the truth.

The Guardian,Is the war in Ukraine escalating or headed toward an endgame? | Christopher S Chivvis,"Allowing Ukraine to use US Atacms missiles for deep strikes may be worth the risk if it hastens negotiationsIt seems like the war in Ukraine is on the brink of escalating to a new level. North Korean troops have joined Russia on the battlefield, Ukraine is striking deep into Russian territory with US-provided weapons, and the Kremlin is yet again making nuclear threats. These developments intensify the sense that this war could spiral out of control. Paradoxically, however, they may also help usher in its end.In October, North Korea added 11,000 troops to the battlefield on Russia’s side. The Biden administration said this were an unacceptable escalation. Over the weekend, it approved Ukraine’s use of US-provided missiles for long-range strikes into Russia. Russia responded with a new and more threatening nuclear doctrine that says it might use its nuclear arsenal against a non-nuclear country – a not-so-thinly veiled threat to Ukraine.Christopher S Chivvis is a senior fellow and director of the Carnegie Endowment’s American statecraft program Continue reading...","Thu, 21 Nov 2024 21:00:04 GMT",-0.5994,-0.9793
The Guardian,"Kind, belligerent, and the man all sides trusted: that’s the John Prescott I knew | Gaby Hinsliff","He was the soul and conscience of Labour and persuaded millions to keep the faith – even when Blair sorely tested itWithout him, it could all so easily have fallen apart. There are vanishingly few politicians of any era of whom that’s true, but John Prescott was one of them. Though doomed to be remembered for that punch thrown on the campaign trail, it’s as an admittedly often belligerent keeper of the peace that history should really remember him: the man all sides trusted because he seemed so uncomplicatedly himself. If that sounds easy, think how many politicians have tried to project authenticity and failed. Among modern politicians only Nigel Farage comes close, and Prescott in his heyday would have eaten Farage for breakfast.Beneath the gruffness he could be funny and kind – he once obligingly moved an interview so that I wasn’t late for my own hen night, though he was deputy prime minister at the time – but also oddly vulnerable. It took courage for a man who had always been sensitive to ridicule to confess, as he did on leaving office, to a long struggle with bulimia. But the eating disorder was perhaps his way of managing an anxiety familiar to so many working-class kids made good: the nagging fear that any minute now someone will realise you don’t belong and kick you out. He’d never forgotten the love letters once returned to him by a girl he had a crush on, complete with spelling mistakes corrected, nor the Tory MPs who knew he’d been a waiter on cruise ships and would shout “Mine’s a gin and tonic, Giovanni!” across the chamber.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"The west’s reckless escalation of the war in Ukraine will cause more suffering, for no strategic gain | Simon Jenkins","Putin is an isolated dictator, devoid of scruple. Firing missiles into Russia will only lead to more hardship for the people of UkraineThis is how big wars start, when small ones go wrong. Nato politicians are deliberately playing with fire along the Ukrainian frontier, as UK-made missiles have been launched into Russia for the first time since the beginning of the conflict. The attack came a day after Kyiv used US-supplied long-range weapons to strike within Russia. Every military comment on British and US authorisation of missile attacks on Russia has said the same. They are “too little, too late”, and unlikely to affect a war that has increasingly turned to Russia’s advantage.So why are the attacks happening? The answer of Britain’s defence secretary, John Healey, is that he wants to “continue doubling down” on Britain’s support for Ukraine and give a morale boost to its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, before Donald Trump takes power in Washington. He clearly thinks the obvious risk involved in the escalation is worthwhile.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Why are we laughing at male ignorance about menstruation? Where are the LOLs? | Rebecca Shaw,"I’m done with viral videos of men who don’t know where a tampon goes. They need to grow up. PeriodI often get annoyed while looking at the internet. It’s part of the deal. Usually it’s easy to scroll past irritating content and not lose time over it but sometimes this is more difficult – for example when you are experiencing premenstrual syndrome.I say this because for the past few months I’ve noticed a few online trends that have something in common: periods and irritating me. The first is viral videos of men hooked up to a machine that simulates period pain, applied by what seems to be a merry travelling group of educators who get to make men feel bad as their job (where do I sign up?). Sometimes their partners who have painful periods or endometriosis are also hooked up – the end result is seeing a man groaning in pain and unable to stand while a woman chuckles at how tolerable it is compared with her reality.

The Guardian,The ICC arrest warrants must bring an end to Israel’s atrocities – and true accountability for all the guilty | Owen Jones,"Benjamin Netanyahu and his former foreign minister have been accused of heinous crimes. This must mark a turning pointIt is not just Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant who should fear accountability for one of the gravest crimes of our age. If the international criminal court (ICC) had not issued today’s arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister and his erstwhile defence minister – and indeed Hamas military leader Mohammed Deif – a global legal order already widely regarded with contempt by much of the world would not have survived.Why? Because of the scale of the alleged crime. Because of the overwhelming body of evidence, not least that accumulated by Palestinian journalists, many of whom acted as the world’s eyes and ears on the killing fields of Gaza before being killed by Israel, often alongside their families. And because few crimes in modern history have been so confessed to – boasted about even – by the perpetrators, from leaders at the top to the soldiers unleashing murderous mayhem on the ground. That the evidence for war crimes and crimes against humanity has met the threshold to satisfy the ICC’s chief prosecutor, an independent panel of esteemed lawyers and now three pre-trial international judges demonstrates the strength of the case – and that nobody who facilitated this historic abomination can plead ignorance. It is not just Netanyahu and Gallant who should tremble before justice: as well as other Israeli leaders and soldiers, so should the guilty men and women of western governments.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,"After 44 years as a Labour member, I spent 18 months facing explusion. This is what the party got wrong | Neal Lawson","People are being threatened and punished at the hint of cross-party cooperation. It’s control freakery we cannot affordIn June 2023 I was served notice by the Labour party that my 44-year membership could be terminated over a retweet supporting cross-party progressive cooperation. Almost 18 months later I, quite nervously, opened an email telling me I had been found “not guilty”. In most ways I matter not a jot: I was probably being used as a more high-profile example to warn others off such abhorrent behaviour.Less robust and less well-connected figures, those for whom their party membership matters enormously, find such a trial a real ordeal. I’ve been let off by people I don’t know in a system operating in the dark. I made a big public fuss. Others can’t, and suffer their fate alone. And there are many of them.

The Guardian,I've seen how waiting for treatment can ruin women's lives. This is how Labour can keep its promise to help them | Ranee Thakar,"Gynaecology has one of the longest waiting lists in the UK. Women’s health has been neglected for too long Ranee Thakar is president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsA few weeks ago, a police officer came to my urogynaecology clinic for a follow-up appointment. She told me that, since her surgery, her life had changed completely. When I first met her she had been waiting years for treatment for incontinence, and she was miserable. She’d been taking more and more time off work as her condition deteriorated, and had started to feel that there was no hope. Now, after a relatively simple operation, she’s back at work and thrilled with life. I love my job, and I cannot measure the joy that we give to patients when we manage to help them, but I’m frustrated that they often have to wait so long.As a new report from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) shows, women such as my patient are the tip of the iceberg. It found that more than three-quarters of a million women are on waiting lists trying to get treatment for serious gynaecological conditions – and they are just the ones who have seen a GP and been referred onwards for specialist care. Gynaecology has one of the worst waiting lists across the UK. More than three-quarters (76%) of women waiting for care reported worsening mental health and more than two-thirds (69%) said they were unable to take part in daily activities, including work, socialising, having relationships and caring responsibilities. Many of them mentioned experiencing pain, exhaustion, breathlessness, dizziness, anaemia and infections because of their worsening conditions.Ranee Thakar is president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and a consultant obstetrician and urogynaecologist at Croydon university hospitalAs told to Katy Guest Continue reading...","Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:00:47 GMT",0.0516,-0.9445
The Guardian,The Guardian view on defence spending: performative opposition obscures common ground | Editorial,"Tory complaints about Labour’s choices ring hollow when they still deny their culpability for the whole budget messWestminster politics is adept at hiding consensus. The oppositional style, embedded in the layout of the House of Commons, requires a performance of partisanship that often goes beyond genuine differences of opinion. It was predictable that the Conservatives would accuse the government of weakening national defences by scrapping old military hardware as part of a departmental savings drive. John Healey, the defence secretary, says the items in question – mostly helicopters and sea vessels – are obsolete or defective. Military chiefs confirm that assessment. The savings for the defence budget are £500m.But James Cartlidge, the shadow defence secretary, laments an injudicious disposal of capabilities “just as the threats to our nation are growing”. Ben Wallace, a former Conservative defence secretary, describes it as “pure folly”. The Tories would like this argument to reinforce their claim that Labour is weak on national security, as evidenced by refusal to match the timetable Rishi Sunak set for raising defence spending to at least 2.5% of gross domestic product. Sir Keir Starmer has a “cast-iron commitment” to reach that target – the current figure is about 2.3% – but not a specific date. The prime minister’s argument is that defence priorities will be settled as part of a wider review, due next year. That will then dictate the rate at which spending can usefully be ramped up.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,The Guardian view on physician associates: the NHS must level with the public | Editorial,"Wes Streeting’s review must lead to greater clarity if confidence is to be rebuiltThe plan for the NHS workforce in England created under the Conservatives is already under review. Given&nbsp;Labour’s pledge to rewire the system – emphasising prevention and care delivered in the community rather than in hospitals – the overall staffing mix is bound to be reconfigured when the 10-year plan is launched next year. But amid these wider changes, and ongoing difficulties around workforce shortages, a simmering row about the role&nbsp;of&nbsp;physician associates (PAs) has become too hot&nbsp;to&nbsp;ignore. Wes Streeting’s announcement this week&nbsp;of a review, to be led by Prof&nbsp;Gillian Leng, showed&nbsp;that ministers have accepted the view of doctors that there is a problem.The physician associate (PA) role was copied from the US. Television viewers of a certain age may well have had their first encounter with one on screen: Jeanie Boulet was a main character in the Chicago-set hospital drama ER. Not long after this, in 2003, the first&nbsp;PAs were employed in the NHS – initially with the&nbsp;title physician assistant. But since 2014 they have&nbsp;been known as physician associates – alongside a much smaller number of anaesthetic associates.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian,Challenges of improving policing across Britain | Letters,"Readers respond to a police chief’s call for reforms to end the different standards of policing across England and WalesYet again we have a senior chief constable calling for a single national police force (In England and Wales, where you live determines the kind of policing you get. That isn’t right, 18 November). Gavin Stephens rightly points out the logistical difficulties created by having 43 separate and independent police forces in England and Wales, but he fails to mention the other side of the coin: the increased danger in reduced accountability and the potential increases in the abuse of power by concentrating the considerable powers of chief constables into a single authority.The importance of pluralism in police provision is occasionally seen in the identification of poor performance and the rectification of abuses by chief constables. To do this would be far more difficult in a single national force. My time on the West Yorkshire police authority when it was an integral part of the West Yorkshire metropolitan county council was salutary. Its policing of the 1984-85 miners’ strike was significantly different from the more confrontational actions in South Yorkshire. It is not possible to guarantee which policy would be followed by a single national force. I would not wish the latter style to become nationally dominant.

The Guardian,Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend,"Højlund has chance to impress Amorim, Villa look to end miserable month and will Forest trouble Arsenal?After masterminding Leicester’s return to the Premier League, Enzo Maresca jumped ship to Chelsea. The Italian had given little confidence he would stay at the King Power, despite his success amid problems in the background and the lure of London. Maresca did, however, ensure he took one thing with him in the form of the central midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, a leading light in the Foxes’ promotion charge. While Maresca has impressed at Stamford Bridge, Dewsbury-Hall is yet to find his feet and has been limited to a cup-player role. Of his 10 appearances for Chelsea, only three have been in the league and none from the start. It might be time to show some faith in him and there is no better place to do so than his old home. Dewsbury-Hall rose through the ranks at Leicester and his £30m transfer fee this summer was highly beneficial to their accounts after financial problems. Leicester fans will welcome back Maresca and Dewsbury-Hall with open arms, the embrace the latter might need to kickstart his Chelsea career.

And, unless you’ve had a bad case of swimmer’s ear, you’ll have heard about the wild swimming trend. The Outdoor Swimming Society says that several million people in the UK now take to rivers, lakes, lidos and seas each year. Their main motivation? Joy, with 94% saying they felt happier and less stressed after a swim.Team GB’s five-medal haul – one gold and four silvers – at the Paris Olympic Games 2024 likely encouraged more people to take up or return to the sport, too.

The Guardian,Death Becomes Her review – 90s comedy gets dazzling Broadway rebirth,"Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, New YorkRobert Zemeckis’s dark, Hollywood-set hit makes a smooth transition to the stage in a raucously entertaining musical crowd-pleaserLike its duelling antiheroines, Death Becomes Her refuses to die. There might not be quite the same stickiness or, unfairly, respect as that afforded to some of its 90s comedy peers but it’s lingered around the outskirts anyway, with drag tributes or Halloween costumes or comparisons to Real Housewives stars or, most recently, similarities to The Substance (it’s the infinitely better movie).The themes, of ageing anxieties and the cruel impossibility of beauty standards, are also never going away – if anything they’ve become more centre-staged – and so some sort of reimagining has felt inevitable for a while (rumours of a remake have circulated for years). It tracks that a rebirth on Broadway would come next, with both the conveyor belt of screen-to-stage adaptations refusing to slow down and the original’s brash theatrical humour making it a perfect fit. Success was far less inevitable though given the quality of many examples that came before it, from Pretty Woman to Mrs Doubtfire to, bafflingly, Indecent Proposal.

The Guardian,Michael Morpurgo’s Pinocchio review – there’s nothing wooden about this magical musical,"Watermill theatre, NewburyA stupendous cast, outstanding stagecraft and delightful songs prove how thrilling an old story can become in the right handsThis musical incarnation of the classic story about a talking marionette has been made by many cooks: Michael Morpurgo took Carlo Collodi’s 19th-century original and remoulded it to tell Pinocchio’s story from the boy’s perspective. Simon Reade adapts that iteration for the stage, and Chris Larner adds songs on top. The result is an exemplar of how thrilling an old story can become in the right hands.From the first gorgeous scene featuring a luminous cherry tree trunk wrapped around actors to signify the wood from which Pinocchio is forged, this production oozes carnivalesque energy and has an intimacy despite its big imagination. It packs in the drama to become an alchemical mix of music, movement, mischievous humour and quietly revolutionary puppetry. Continue reading...","Thu, 21 Nov 2024 14:49:42 GMT",0.0,0.9783

Colleagues who knew him only as a software engineer in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, where he worked on the Mars Exploration Rovers, occasionally stumbled upon news of his prior adventures by accident. “They’d say, ‘I’ve known you for five years and I only just found out it was you with the Gossamer and the English Channel,’” says the 72-year-old from his home in Los Osos.What he is referring to is the part he played in winning two Kremer prizes for human-powered flight, the first two in the award’s history in fact, in lightweight aircraft built by the aeronautical engineer Paul MacCready. In 1977, Allen, an experienced hang-glider, piloted the 70lb (31.75kg) Gossamer Condor over a mile-long, figure-of-eight course in Shafter, California. Two years later, it was his pedal power that got the Gossamer Albatross, which was one pound heavier, across the Channel. Allen moved on to other projects, breaking more records along the way, but the Gossamer story proved to have legs. Or rather, wings. Continue reading...","Thu, 21 Nov 2024 10:50:26 GMT",0.0,0.6124

The Guardian,The ‘mad egghead’ who built a mouse utopia,"John Calhoun designed an apartment complex for mice to examine the effects of overcrowding. It was hailed as a groundbreaking study of social breakdown, but is largely forgotten. So what happened?Standing before the Royal Society of Medicine in London on 22 June 1972, the ecologist turned psychologist John Bumpass Calhoun, the director of the Laboratory of Brain Evolution and Behavior at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, appeared a mild-mannered, smallish man, sporting a greying goatee. After what must surely have been one of the oddest opening remarks to the Royal Society in its storied 200-plus-year history – “I shall largely speak of mice,” Calhoun began, “but my thoughts are on man, on healing, on life and its evolution” – he spoke of a long-term experiment he was running on the effects of overcrowding and population crashes in mice.Members of the Royal Society were scratching their heads as Calhoun told them of Universe 25, a giant experimental setup he had built and which he described as “a utopian environment constructed for mice”. Still, they listened carefully as he described that universe. They learned that to study the effects of overpopulation, Calhoun, in addition to being a scientist, needed to be a rodent city planner. For Universe 25, he had built a large, very intricate apartment block for mice. There were 16 identical apartment buildings arranged in a square with four buildings on each side. Calhoun told his audience each building had “four four-unit walk-up one-room apartments”, for a total of 256 units, each of which could comfortably accommodate about 15 mouse residents. There were also a series of dining halls in each apartment building, and a cluster of rooftop fountains so the residents could quench their thirst. Calhoun had marked each mouse resident with a unique colour combination and he or his team sat in a loft over this mouseopolis, for hours every day, for more than three years, and watched what unfolded.
